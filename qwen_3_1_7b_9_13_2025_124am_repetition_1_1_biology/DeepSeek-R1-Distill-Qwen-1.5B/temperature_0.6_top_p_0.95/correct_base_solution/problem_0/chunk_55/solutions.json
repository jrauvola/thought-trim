    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has two possible outcomes.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has two possible outcomes. Since there are two genes, there are 2x2=4 possible phenotypic categories. However, the question asks specifically about checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. That corresponds to:\n\n1. Both genes are recessive: c c and b b \u2192 plain red\n2. C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both genes recessive \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, but if \"checkered\" is c and \"plain\" is cc, then the phenotype depends on whether the animal is checkered (c) or plain (cc). Similarly, \"brown\" is B and \"checkered\" is b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of C (pigment) and B (color).\n\nNow, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine this, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype occurring.\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of being present (C or B) and 75% absent (c or b). Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of each gene's probability.\n\nLet's list the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: This requires both genes to be recessive. So, c (for plain) and b (for checkered). Probability = (probability of c) * (probability of b) = (0.5) * (0.75) = 0.375 or 3/8.\n2. Checkered brown: This requires C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered). Probability = (0.5) * (0.25) = 0.125 or 1/8.\n3. Plain red: This requires c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown). Probability = (0.5) * (0.25) = 0.125 or 1/8.\n4. Plain brown: This requires c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown). Probability = (0.5) * (0.75) = 0.375 or 3/8.\n\nAdding these up: 3/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 3/8 = 8/8 = 1. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 for checkered red to plain red, and 1:1 for checkered brown to plain brown.\n\nBut wait, the question seems to ask for the ratio among all phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2. If the F2 is produced from F1 selfing, and F1 is CcBb, then the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on the presence of C and B. Let's count how many of each genotype leads to what phenotype.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- CC bb: Plain brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (c recessive, B recessive)\n- Cc bb: Plain brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n- cc BB: Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (c recessive, B recessive)\n- cc bb: Checkered red (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo now, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, cc BB, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Plain red: Cc BB, cc BB, cc bb \u2192 3?\n\nWait, no. Let me recount properly:\n\nFrom the F2, the genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nSo,\n\n- Checkered red: 1,4,9 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: 2,5 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: 3,6,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain red: 7 \u2192 1\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me count again:\n\nCheckered red: 1,4,9 \u2192 3\n\nCheckered brown: 2,5 \u2192 2\n\nPlain brown: 3,6,8 \u2192 3\n\nPlain red: 7 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 3+2+3+1=9, which matches the 3/8 and 1/8 probabilities.\n\nBut looking back, the options given include different ratios. The options A to H provide various ratios like 6:2:2:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. Maybe I should consider dominance and inheritance differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 without considering dominance but rather on the actual F2 counts, regardless of dominance. In that case, the counts would be:\n\nFor each F2 genotype:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 (CC BB, Cc BB, cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (CC Bb, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc brown)\nWait, no. From above, CC bb is Plain brown, Cc bb is Plain brown, and cc bb is Plain red. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered red\nCC Bb | Checkered brown\nCC bb | Plain brown\nCc BB | Checkered red\nCc Bb | Checkered brown\nCc bb | Plain brown\ncc BB | Plain red\ncc Bb | Plain brown\ncc bb | Checkered red\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1), Cc BB (2), cc bb (3) \u2192 total 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb (4), Cc Bb (5) \u2192 total 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb (6), Cc bb (7), cc bb (8) \u2192 wait, no. Wait, cc bb is Plain red, not brown. So CC bb \u2192 Plain brown, Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown, cc bb \u2192 Plain red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Plain brown: CC bb (6), Cc bb (7) \u2192 2\n- Plain red: cc BB (8), cc Bb (9) \u2192 2\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+2+2=9, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 is 3:2:2:2, where checkered red : checkered brown : plain brown : plain red.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 3:2:2:2.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check:\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, Cc BB, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Plain red: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 3:2:2:2. Hmm, maybe I misread the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because there are animals that are checkered brown and plain brown.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't matching our 3:2:2:2.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, which is a 3:1 ratio for each pair, but that might be the F1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So according to our calculations, it's 3:2:2:2. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the F2 is not being considered correctly. The question mentions adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (i.e., F2) would indeed be the next generation.\n\nBut perhaps the options are considering the F1 instead of F2. Let's see what the F1 phenotypic ratio would be.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb):\n\n- Checkered red (C and B dominant): 25%\n- Checkered brown (C and b recessive): 25%\n- Plain brown (c and B recessive): 25%\n- Plain red (c and b recessive): 25%\n\nSo the F1 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not any of the options either. Wait, option J is 2,6,3,1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. That's 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, not 16, so probably wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation after F1 \u00d7 F1, but the options don't align with our calculation. Alternatively, maybe I've misapplied Mendelian laws.\n\nAnother approach: since each gene is independent, the F2 will have 4^2 = 16 possible phenotypic combinations. But considering dominance, some will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nBut let's recalculate:\n\nThe F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 1,4,9 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: 2,5 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: 3,6,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain red: 7 \u2192 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:2:2:2, which is 3:2:2:2. Looking at the options, none directly state this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option G is 9,3,3,1, which is the F1 ratio. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply all phenotypes equally likely. But according to our calculation, they aren't equally likely. Therefore, perhaps none of the options match, but since that's unlikely, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield F2.\n\nBut perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio. Because the F1 is 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options except option J, which is 2,6,3,1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Summing to 12, but F1 is 4, so this seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1 instead of F2. If that were the case, the F1 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which also doesn't match any option.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to reconsider the problem statement. The question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, for color, the alleles are B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, plain). For pigment, C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain). Pigment is controlled by the C gene, and color by the B gene.\n\nSo, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The F2 phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of C and B.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype: dominant C/B lead to red, recessive to plain. And within those, dominant B/b lead to brown, recessive to plain.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene:\n\nProbability of Checkered red (C and B dominant): (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n\nWait, but that contradicts previous calculations. Wait, no. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, so overall, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, but broken down by phenotype.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: For each gene, the ratio is 3:1 (dominant:recessive). So for two genes, the combined ratio is (3\u00d73):(3\u00d71)+(1\u00d73)+(1\u00d71)=9:6:3:1. But when broken down into phenotypes, each gene contributes to the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's use a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nParental F1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes for each gene:\n\n- For C (pigment):\n  - C (25%), c (75%)\n\n- For B (color):\n  - B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSo the Punnett square combines these:\n\nGametes for C: C (25%) and c (75%)\n\nGametes for B: B (25%) and b (75%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: (25% x 25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n- CC bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n- Cc BB: (50% x 25%) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50% x 75%) = 37.5%\n- Cc bb: (50% x 75%) = 37.5%\n- cc BB: (25% x 25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n- cc bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n\nNow, breaking these down into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 3)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 3)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red (phenotype 4)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 3)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% + 37.5% + 18.75% = 75%\n- Plain brown: 18.75% + 37.5% + 18.75% = 75%\n- Plain red: 6.25%\n\nWhich translates to a 1:3:3:1 ratio, but broken down by phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain red = 25% : 75% : 75% : 25%, or simplifying, 1:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. The closest might be option F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not right. Option E: 3:9:1:3, which is the F1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option G: 9,3,3,1, which is the F1 ratio squared. Option J: 2,6,3,1, which is the F1 ratio multiplied by 2, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two possible outcomes. Since there are two genes, there are 2x2=4 possible phenotypic categories. However, the question asks specifically about checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. That corresponds to:\n\n1. Both genes are recessive: c c and b b \u2192 plain red\n2. C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both genes recessive \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, but if \"checkered\" is c and \"plain\" is cc, then the phenotype depends on whether the animal is checkered (c) or plain (cc). Similarly, \"brown\" is B and \"checkered\" is b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of C (pigment) and B (color).\n\nNow, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine this, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype occurring.\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of being present (C or B) and 75% absent (c or b). Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of each gene's probability.\n\nLet's list the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: This requires both genes to be recessive. So, c (for plain) and b (for checkered). Probability = (probability of c) * (probability of b) = (0.5) * (0.75) = 0.375 or 3/8.\n2. Checkered brown: This requires C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered). Probability = (0.5) * (0.25) = 0.125 or 1/8.\n3. Plain red: This requires c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown). Probability = (0.5) * (0.25) = 0.125 or 1/8.\n4. Plain brown: This requires c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown). Probability = (0.5) * (0.75) = 0.375 or 3/8.\n\nAdding these up: 3/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 3/8 = 8/8 = 1. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 for checkered red to plain red, and 1:1 for checkered brown to plain brown.\n\nBut wait, the question seems to ask for the ratio among all phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2. If the F2 is produced from F1 selfing, and F1 is CcBb, then the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on the presence of C and B. Let's count how many of each genotype leads to what phenotype.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- CC bb: Plain brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (c recessive, B recessive)\n- Cc bb: Plain brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n- cc BB: Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (c recessive, B recessive)\n- cc bb: Checkered red (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo now, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, cc BB, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Plain red: Cc BB, cc BB, cc bb \u2192 3?\n\nWait, no. Let me recount properly:\n\nFrom the F2, the genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nSo,\n\n- Checkered red: 1,4,9 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: 2,5 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: 3,6,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain red: 7 \u2192 1\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me count again:\n\nCheckered red: 1,4,9 \u2192 3\n\nCheckered brown: 2,5 \u2192 2\n\nPlain brown: 3,6,8 \u2192 3\n\nPlain red: 7 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 3+2+3+1=9, which matches the 3/8 and 1/8 probabilities.\n\nBut looking back, the options given include different ratios. The options A to H provide various ratios like 6:2:2:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. Maybe I should consider dominance and inheritance differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 without considering dominance but rather on the actual F2 counts, regardless of dominance. In that case, the counts would be:\n\nFor each F2 genotype:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 (CC BB, Cc BB, cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (CC Bb, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc brown)\nWait, no. From above, CC bb is Plain brown, Cc bb is Plain brown, and cc bb is Plain red. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered red\nCC Bb | Checkered brown\nCC bb | Plain brown\nCc BB | Checkered red\nCc Bb | Checkered brown\nCc bb | Plain brown\ncc BB | Plain red\ncc Bb | Plain brown\ncc bb | Checkered red\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1), Cc BB (2), cc bb (3) \u2192 total 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb (4), Cc Bb (5) \u2192 total 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb (6), Cc bb (7), cc bb (8) \u2192 wait, no. Wait, cc bb is Plain red, not brown. So CC bb \u2192 Plain brown, Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown, cc bb \u2192 Plain red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Plain brown: CC bb (6), Cc bb (7) \u2192 2\n- Plain red: cc BB (8), cc Bb (9) \u2192 2\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+2+2=9, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 is 3:2:2:2, where checkered red : checkered brown : plain brown : plain red.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 3:2:2:2.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check:\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, Cc BB, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Plain red: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 3:2:2:2. Hmm, maybe I misread the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because there are animals that are checkered brown and plain brown.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't matching our 3:2:2:2.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, which is a 3:1 ratio for each pair, but that might be the F1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So according to our calculations, it's 3:2:2:2. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the F2 is not being considered correctly. The question mentions adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (i.e., F2) would indeed be the next generation.\n\nBut perhaps the options are considering the F1 instead of F2. Let's see what the F1 phenotypic ratio would be.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb):\n\n- Checkered red (C and B dominant): 25%\n- Checkered brown (C and b recessive): 25%\n- Plain brown (c and B recessive): 25%\n- Plain red (c and b recessive): 25%\n\nSo the F1 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not any of the options either. Wait, option J is 2,6,3,1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. That's 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, not 16, so probably wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation after F1 \u00d7 F1, but the options don't align with our calculation. Alternatively, maybe I've misapplied Mendelian laws.\n\nAnother approach: since each gene is independent, the F2 will have 4^2 = 16 possible phenotypic combinations. But considering dominance, some will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nBut let's recalculate:\n\nThe F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 1,4,9 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: 2,5 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: 3,6,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain red: 7 \u2192 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:2:2:2, which is 3:2:2:2. Looking at the options, none directly state this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option G is 9,3,3,1, which is the F1 ratio. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply all phenotypes equally likely. But according to our calculation, they aren't equally likely. Therefore, perhaps none of the options match, but since that's unlikely, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield F2.\n\nBut perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio. Because the F1 is 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options except option J, which is 2,6,3,1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Summing to 12, but F1 is 4, so this seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1 instead of F2. If that were the case, the F1 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which also doesn't match any option.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to reconsider the problem statement. The question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, for color, the alleles are B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, plain). For pigment, C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain). Pigment is controlled by the C gene, and color by the B gene.\n\nSo, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The F2 phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of C and B.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype: dominant C/B lead to red, recessive to plain. And within those, dominant B/b lead to brown, recessive to plain.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene:\n\nProbability of Checkered red (C and B dominant): (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n\nWait, but that contradicts previous calculations. Wait, no. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, so overall, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, but broken down by phenotype.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: For each gene, the ratio is 3:1 (dominant:recessive). So for two genes, the combined ratio is (3\u00d73):(3\u00d71)+(1\u00d73)+(1\u00d71)=9:6:3:1. But when broken down into phenotypes, each gene contributes to the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's use a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nParental F1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes for each gene:\n\n- For C (pigment):\n  - C (25%), c (75%)\n\n- For B (color):\n  - B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSo the Punnett square combines these:\n\nGametes for C: C (25%) and c (75%)\n\nGametes for B: B (25%) and b (75%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: (25% x 25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n- CC bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n- Cc BB: (50% x 25%) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50% x 75%) = 37.5%\n- Cc bb: (50% x 75%) = 37.5%\n- cc BB: (25% x 25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n- cc bb: (25% x 75%) = 18.75%\n\nNow, breaking these down into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 3)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 3)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red (phenotype 4)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 3)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% + 37.5% + 18.75% = 75%\n- Plain brown: 18.75% + 37.5% + 18.75% = 75%\n- Plain red: 6.25%\n\nWhich translates to a 1:3:3:1 ratio, but broken down by phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain red = 25% : 75% : 75% : 25%, or simplifying, 1:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. The closest might be option F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not right. Option E: 3:9:1:3, which is the F1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option G: 9,3,3,1, which is the F1 ratio squared. Option J: 2,6,3,1, which is the F1 ratio multiplied by 2, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming that the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones, so the phenotype depends on whether both dominant alleles are present.",
    "rollout": " Assuming that the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones, so the phenotype depends on whether both dominant alleles are present.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. So if a bird has at least one C allele, it shows checkered (or plain?), wait, hold on: the problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one C allele, it shows checkered; otherwise, it shows plain. Similarly, for color: if a bird has at least one B allele, it shows brown; else, it shows checkered. Wait, no: the problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by a recessive b.\n\nBut the first part says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nAnd then the color traits:\n\n- Red: dominant B\n- Brown: recessive b\n\nSo, for the bird's phenotype:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it's checkered (since C is dominant).\n- If it doesn't have any C alleles (i.e., cc), then it's plain.\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (BB or Bb), it's brown.\n- If it has no B alleles (bb), it's checkered.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the pattern is C (dominant) vs c (recessive). And for color, it's B (dominant) vs b (recessive).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be determined by checking both genes. For example, a bird could be:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: brown checkered\n- If C is present and B is absent: plain checkered\n- If C is absent and B is present: brown plain\n- If both C and B are absent: plain brown\n\nWait, no: if C is absent (cc), then regardless of B, it's plain. Because C being absent makes it plain, overriding B. Similarly, if B is absent (bb), regardless of C, it's checkered.\n\nLet me structure the phenotypes correctly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotypes\n--- | ---\n1. Brown Checkered | Bb (but wait, no\u2014if C is present (so not c), and B is present (so not b), it's brown checkered. So B must be present (at least one B allele) and C must be present (at least one C allele).\n\nWait, no: the presence of C allows it to show checkered, and presence of B allows it to show brown. So the phenotype depends on the presence of both alleles for each trait.\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- If C is present (so not cc) AND B is present (so not bb):\n  - Phenotype: Brown Checkered\n- If C is present (not cc) BUT B is absent (bb):\n  - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n- If C is absent (cc) BUT B is present (Bb):\n  - Phenotype: Brown Plain\n- If C is absent (cc) AND B is absent (bb):\n  - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nWait, but I think I got that reversed. Because if C is present, the bird is checkered regardless of B. So:\n\nIf C is present (C_), the bird is checkered. But if C is present and B is also present (B_), then it's brown checkered. If C is present and B is absent (Bb), then it's plain checkered. Similarly, if C is absent (cc), the bird is plain. But within plain (cc), the color is determined by B: if B is present (B_), it's brown; if B is absent (bb), it's plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: C_ and B_\n2. Plain Checkered: C_ and bb\n3. Brown Plain: cc and B_\n4. Plain Brown: cc and bb\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% Ccbb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Brown Checkered\n- Ccbb: Plain Checkered\n- ccBb: Brown Plain\n- ccbb: Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent contributes half the gametes, and there are four possible gametes (but proportionally 25% each):\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%\n\nPhenotype distribution:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: 25% (from CcBb)\n2. Plain Checkered: 25% (from Ccbb)\n3. Brown Plain: 25% (from ccBb)\n4. Plain Brown: 25% (from ccbb)\n\nWait, but that's 100%, right?\n\nBut according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A to H list various phenotypic ratios. Let's see what the options suggest.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which might make sense for a diploid organism, but perhaps the numbers don't align.\n\nAlternatively, Option J suggests checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12, which seems low.\n\nLooking back, our calculation suggests 25% each phenotype, so 4 categories each with 25% chance. But the answer choices don't directly reflect this. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual F2 phenotypic ratio isn't equally distributed because some genotypes may lead to similar phenotypes, but in reality, the phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the C and B genes interact differently. For instance, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes might combine certain genotypes into same phenotypic categories. But looking back, our analysis didn't consider any interaction beyond the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation results in specific ratios based on the genetic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the number of each genotype in F2. Each F1 (CcBb) selfs, leading to F2:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb (wait, no: each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the parent can contribute either dominant or recessive. For the first gene (C), each parent contributes C or c. For the second gene (B), each parent contributes B or b.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined genotypes are products of these distributions. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThis totals 100%.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown Checkered\n- CC Bb: Brown Checkered\n- CC bb: Plain Checkered\n- Cc BB: Brown Checkered\n- Cc Bb: Brown Plain\n- Cc bb: Brown Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nSo, categorizing:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: CC_, Cc_, so 25% +25% +25% = 75%\nWait, no: CC_ includes CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb. That's 25% +25% +25% = 75% of the population.\n\nWait, no, because each gene's distribution is multiplied. So the percentage for each phenotype is:\n\nBrown Checkered: 75% (since all individuals with C_ and B_) \nPlain Checkered: 25% (only cc )\nBrown Plain: 25% (all with B_ but cc )\nPlain Brown: 25% (all with bb )\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 75% (because C_ and B_ => 75%)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (cc)\n- Brown Plain: 25% (B_ but cc)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (bb)\n\nBut wait, this contradicts my previous understanding. Let me re-express:\n\nEach gene has a 75% chance of being present (for C_: C_ is CC or Cc, which is 75%) and similarly for B_ (BB or Bb, 75%). But since the loci are independent, the probability of having both C_ and B_ is 75% * 75% = 56.25%? No, that's not correct. Because the phenotypes aren't simply additive in terms of percentages; instead, each individual is categorized based on their combination.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me approach it differently. The total F2 population is 100%.\n\nThe number of individuals with each phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes' contributions.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown Checkered: requires C_ and B_. Both genes are present. The probability for each gene is 75%, so together it's 75% * 75% = 56.25% of the population.\n\nWait, no, because each individual's genotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of having both C_ and B_ is indeed 56.25%. Similarly:\n\n- Plain Checkered: requires c_ (so cc) and B_. Probability of B_ is 75%, and c_ is 25% (since cc is 25%). So 25% * 75% = 18.75% for B_ cc.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, since B_ is 75%, and c_ is 25%, the number of individuals with B_ and cc is 25% * 75% = 18.75%.\n\nSimilarly, Brown Plain: needs B_ and c_. B_ is 75%, c_ is 25%, so 75% * 25% = 18.75%.\n\nPlain Brown: needs bb and anything. bb is 25%, so 25% * 100% = 25%.\n\nWait, but adding these up: Brown Checkered (56.25%) + Plain Checkered (18.75%) + Brown Plain (18.75%) + Plain Brown (25%) = 118.75%, which exceeds 100%. Clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion. Instead of calculating probabilities, I should count the number of each genotype and then map them to the phenotypes. Since each gene has independent assortment, the possible genotypes are as follows:\n\nNumber of each genotype in F2:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC: 25% (of the population)\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nCombined:\n\nTotal number of each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of F2 * 25% of F2 = 6.25% (assuming 100% population)\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% *25% =12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50%*50%=25%\n- Cc bb: 50%*25%=12.5%\n- cc BB:25%*25%=6.25%\n- cc Bb:25%*50%=12.5%\n- cc bb:25%*25%=6.25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown Checkered\n- CC Bb: Brown Checkered\n- CC bb: Plain Checkered\n- Cc BB: Brown Checkered\n- Cc Bb: Brown Plain\n- Cc bb: Brown Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n1.

Hmm, that's because the assumption of a 100% population without any missing genotypes isn't holding due to rounding.\n\nBut the key point is that each phenotype accounts for approximately 25% of the F2 population. However, when considering exact counts, each phenotype has 25% frequency.\n\nWait, but this leads us back to the original conclusion that each phenotype is equally likely, except for the fact that some genotypes lead to different phenotypes. However, in the F2 generation, each phenotype (Brown Checkered, Plain Checkered, Brown Plain, Plain Brown) appears in 25% of the cases.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none seem to match this exactly.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nWait, option K says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That sums up to 16, which is less than 100%, but perhaps in reality, each phenotype's count is proportional to their fitness or dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the problem considers the pigmentation traits based on the number of B alleles rather than the dominance. That is, if the bird is B_ (has at least one B allele), it's brown; else, it's plain.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming that the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones, so the phenotype depends on whether both dominant alleles are present.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. So if a bird has at least one C allele, it shows checkered (or plain?), wait, hold on: the problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one C allele, it shows checkered; otherwise, it shows plain. Similarly, for color: if a bird has at least one B allele, it shows brown; else, it shows checkered. Wait, no: the problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by a recessive b.\n\nBut the first part says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nAnd then the color traits:\n\n- Red: dominant B\n- Brown: recessive b\n\nSo, for the bird's phenotype:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it's checkered (since C is dominant).\n- If it doesn't have any C alleles (i.e., cc), then it's plain.\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (BB or Bb), it's brown.\n- If it has no B alleles (bb), it's checkered.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the pattern is C (dominant) vs c (recessive). And for color, it's B (dominant) vs b (recessive).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be determined by checking both genes. For example, a bird could be:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: brown checkered\n- If C is present and B is absent: plain checkered\n- If C is absent and B is present: brown plain\n- If both C and B are absent: plain brown\n\nWait, no: if C is absent (cc), then regardless of B, it's plain. Because C being absent makes it plain, overriding B. Similarly, if B is absent (bb), regardless of C, it's checkered.\n\nLet me structure the phenotypes correctly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotypes\n--- | ---\n1. Brown Checkered | Bb (but wait, no\u2014if C is present (so not c), and B is present (so not b), it's brown checkered. So B must be present (at least one B allele) and C must be present (at least one C allele).\n\nWait, no: the presence of C allows it to show checkered, and presence of B allows it to show brown. So the phenotype depends on the presence of both alleles for each trait.\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- If C is present (so not cc) AND B is present (so not bb):\n  - Phenotype: Brown Checkered\n- If C is present (not cc) BUT B is absent (bb):\n  - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n- If C is absent (cc) BUT B is present (Bb):\n  - Phenotype: Brown Plain\n- If C is absent (cc) AND B is absent (bb):\n  - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nWait, but I think I got that reversed. Because if C is present, the bird is checkered regardless of B. So:\n\nIf C is present (C_), the bird is checkered. But if C is present and B is also present (B_), then it's brown checkered. If C is present and B is absent (Bb), then it's plain checkered. Similarly, if C is absent (cc), the bird is plain. But within plain (cc), the color is determined by B: if B is present (B_), it's brown; if B is absent (bb), it's plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: C_ and B_\n2. Plain Checkered: C_ and bb\n3. Brown Plain: cc and B_\n4. Plain Brown: cc and bb\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% Ccbb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Brown Checkered\n- Ccbb: Plain Checkered\n- ccBb: Brown Plain\n- ccbb: Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent contributes half the gametes, and there are four possible gametes (but proportionally 25% each):\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%\n\nPhenotype distribution:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: 25% (from CcBb)\n2. Plain Checkered: 25% (from Ccbb)\n3. Brown Plain: 25% (from ccBb)\n4. Plain Brown: 25% (from ccbb)\n\nWait, but that's 100%, right?\n\nBut according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A to H list various phenotypic ratios. Let's see what the options suggest.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which might make sense for a diploid organism, but perhaps the numbers don't align.\n\nAlternatively, Option J suggests checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12, which seems low.\n\nLooking back, our calculation suggests 25% each phenotype, so 4 categories each with 25% chance. But the answer choices don't directly reflect this. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual F2 phenotypic ratio isn't equally distributed because some genotypes may lead to similar phenotypes, but in reality, the phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the C and B genes interact differently. For instance, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes might combine certain genotypes into same phenotypic categories. But looking back, our analysis didn't consider any interaction beyond the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation results in specific ratios based on the genetic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the number of each genotype in F2. Each F1 (CcBb) selfs, leading to F2:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb (wait, no: each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the parent can contribute either dominant or recessive. For the first gene (C), each parent contributes C or c. For the second gene (B), each parent contributes B or b.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined genotypes are products of these distributions. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThis totals 100%.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown Checkered\n- CC Bb: Brown Checkered\n- CC bb: Plain Checkered\n- Cc BB: Brown Checkered\n- Cc Bb: Brown Plain\n- Cc bb: Brown Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nSo, categorizing:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: CC_, Cc_, so 25% +25% +25% = 75%\nWait, no: CC_ includes CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb. That's 25% +25% +25% = 75% of the population.\n\nWait, no, because each gene's distribution is multiplied. So the percentage for each phenotype is:\n\nBrown Checkered: 75% (since all individuals with C_ and B_) \nPlain Checkered: 25% (only cc )\nBrown Plain: 25% (all with B_ but cc )\nPlain Brown: 25% (all with bb )\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 75% (because C_ and B_ => 75%)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (cc)\n- Brown Plain: 25% (B_ but cc)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (bb)\n\nBut wait, this contradicts my previous understanding. Let me re-express:\n\nEach gene has a 75% chance of being present (for C_: C_ is CC or Cc, which is 75%) and similarly for B_ (BB or Bb, 75%). But since the loci are independent, the probability of having both C_ and B_ is 75% * 75% = 56.25%? No, that's not correct. Because the phenotypes aren't simply additive in terms of percentages; instead, each individual is categorized based on their combination.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me approach it differently. The total F2 population is 100%.\n\nThe number of individuals with each phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes' contributions.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown Checkered: requires C_ and B_. Both genes are present. The probability for each gene is 75%, so together it's 75% * 75% = 56.25% of the population.\n\nWait, no, because each individual's genotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of having both C_ and B_ is indeed 56.25%. Similarly:\n\n- Plain Checkered: requires c_ (so cc) and B_. Probability of B_ is 75%, and c_ is 25% (since cc is 25%). So 25% * 75% = 18.75% for B_ cc.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, since B_ is 75%, and c_ is 25%, the number of individuals with B_ and cc is 25% * 75% = 18.75%.\n\nSimilarly, Brown Plain: needs B_ and c_. B_ is 75%, c_ is 25%, so 75% * 25% = 18.75%.\n\nPlain Brown: needs bb and anything. bb is 25%, so 25% * 100% = 25%.\n\nWait, but adding these up: Brown Checkered (56.25%) + Plain Checkered (18.75%) + Brown Plain (18.75%) + Plain Brown (25%) = 118.75%, which exceeds 100%. Clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion. Instead of calculating probabilities, I should count the number of each genotype and then map them to the phenotypes. Since each gene has independent assortment, the possible genotypes are as follows:\n\nNumber of each genotype in F2:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC: 25% (of the population)\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nCombined:\n\nTotal number of each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of F2 * 25% of F2 = 6.25% (assuming 100% population)\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% *25% =12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50%*50%=25%\n- Cc bb: 50%*25%=12.5%\n- cc BB:25%*25%=6.25%\n- cc Bb:25%*50%=12.5%\n- cc bb:25%*25%=6.25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown Checkered\n- CC Bb: Brown Checkered\n- CC bb: Plain Checkered\n- Cc BB: Brown Checkered\n- Cc Bb: Brown Plain\n- Cc bb: Brown Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n1. Brown Checkered: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 6.25% +12.5% +6.25% =25%\n2. Plain Checkered: CC bb \u2192 6.25%\n3. Brown Plain: Cc Bb \u219225%\n4. Plain Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u21926.25% +12.5% +6.25% =25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Brown Checkered : 25% (phenotype)\n- Plain Checkered : 6.25%\n- Brown Plain :25%\n- Plain Brown:25%\n\nAdding these up: 25 +6.25 +25 +25 = 81.25%, which still leaves 8.75% unaccounted. Hmm, that's because the assumption of a 100% population without any missing genotypes isn't holding due to rounding.\n\nBut the key point is that each phenotype accounts for approximately 25% of the F2 population. However, when considering exact counts, each phenotype has 25% frequency.\n\nWait, but this leads us back to the original conclusion that each phenotype is equally likely, except for the fact that some genotypes lead to different phenotypes. However, in the F2 generation, each phenotype (Brown Checkered, Plain Checkered, Brown Plain, Plain Brown) appears in 25% of the cases.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none seem to match this exactly.

Let me reassess:\n\nIf a bird is B_ (Bb or BB) \u2192 brown\nIf a bird is C_ (Cc or CC) \u2192 checkered\nElse, it's plain.\n\nSo, let's re-calculate the phenotypes based on this.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered\n2. CC Bb: C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered\n3. CC bb: C_ and bb \u2192 Plain\n4. Cc BB: C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered\n5. Cc Bb: C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered\n6.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the dominant and recessive alleles. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor example, the probability of having red pigment (C present) is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc). Similarly, the probability of brown color (B present) is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red and brown. Similarly, the probability of red and checkered would be (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. The same logic applies to plain and brown, which would be (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16, and plain and checkered is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. Looking back at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the phenotypic categories. Let me double-check: If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb. The F2 would have the following genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For the pigment, C is dominant, so in the F2, all individuals with at least one C will express red pigment, regardless of the B allele. For the B gene, only those without B (i.e., with b) will express plain, while those with B will express brown. So the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: All red (regardless of B)\n- Cc: All red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: All plain (regardless of B)\n\nNow, within the cc group (all plain), half will have B and half will have b. So:\n\n- 50% of cc (which is 25% overall) will be checkered (B)\n- 50% of cc (which is 25% overall) will be plain (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Red: 75% of total (all CC, Cc, and 50% of cc)\nWait, no: CC (25%) + Cc (50%) + (50% of cc, which is 12.5%) = total 87.5%\n\nBut wait, the F2 includes four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc. Among these:\n\n- CC: all red\n- Cc: all red\n- cc: half red, half plain (but wait, no: all cc are plain, regardless of B?)\n\nWait, no, for the B gene, in the cc genotype, whether an individual is checkered or plain depends on the B allele. So, in the cc group:\n\n- Half (50%) will have B (so checkered)\n- Half (50%) will have b (so plain)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: All individuals except the cc group (since cc are plain)\nWait, no: All individuals with at least one dominant allele (for either gene) will express their respective traits. So in the F2:\n\n- CC: all red (because C is dominant)\n- Cc: all red (same reason)\n- cc: some may be checkered (if they have B) or plain (if they have b)\n\nWait, but the B gene is separate. So in the cc group:\n\n- 50% will have B (so checkered)\n- 50% will have b (so plain)\n\nTherefore, the total phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Red: All individuals except the cc group (wait, no: the cc group is all plain, but among them, half are checkered and half are plain). Wait, no, because in the F2, the cc genotype contributes to both plain and checkered based on the B gene. So the total phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\n- Total population: 100%\n- Phenotype red: All individuals who are either CC, Cc, or have at least one dominant allele in the B gene.\nWait, no: The presence of any dominant allele (either C or B) leads to the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc BB: red\n- cc bb: plain\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: plain\n\nWait, no: The presence of B means brown, and presence of b means plain. So in the cc genotype:\n\n- If an individual is cc BB: red (both C and B are dominant)\n- cc Bb: checkered (B is dominant, b is recessive)\n- cc bb: plain (no B)\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- All individuals with at least one dominant C are red, regardless of B.\n- All individuals with at least one dominant B are brown, regardless of C.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: All except those with only b alleles (cc bb)\n- Brown: Those with at least one B (including Bb and BB)\n- Checkered: Those with at least one B and at least one b (Bb)\n- Plain: Those with only b alleles (cc bb)\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2: 100 individuals.\n\nPhenotype red: All except cc bb (1 person), so 99\nBut wait, the F2 includes all possible genotypes, so:\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - All red (B present)\n   \n2. Cc (50%):\n   - All red (C present)\n   \n3. cc (25%):\n   - 50% B (checkered)\n   - 50% b (plain)\n\nSo now, converting these into numbers:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 25 (all red)\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 25 (checkered)\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 25 (plain)\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nRed: CC (25) + Cc (50) + cc BB (25) = 100? Wait, that can't be right because total should be 100. Wait, no: wait, the cc BB is 25%, which is part of the cc group, which is 25%, but in terms of counts, each percentage translates directly. So:\n\n- CC: 25 \u2192 all red\n- Cc: 50 \u2192 all red\n- cc BB: 25 \u2192 red\n- cc Bb: 25 \u2192 checkered\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 plain\n\nAdding these up:\n\nRed: 25 + 50 + 25 = 100\nCheckered: 25\nPlain: 25\n\nWait, that sums to 150%, which isn't possible. I must have made a mistake. Let me re-express it properly:\n\nThe F2 consists of 100% of individuals, broken down into the different genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - All red \u2192 25 red\n\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - All red \u2192 50 red\n\n3. cc (25%):\n   - 25% of these are cc BB \u2192 red\n   - 25% are cc Bb \u2192 checkered\n   - 25% are cc bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo, adding:\n\n- CC \u2192 25 red\n- Cc \u2192 50 red\n- cc BB \u2192 25 red\n- cc Bb \u2192 25 checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 25 plain\n\nNow, adding the reds: 25 + 50 + 25 = 100\nAdd the checkered: 25\nAdd the plain: 25\n\nWait, that still sums to 150, which is impossible. I must have miscounted. Actually, each percentage represents a portion of the 100, so:\n\n- CC: 25 \u2192 25 red\n- Cc: 50 \u2192 50 red\n- cc BB: 25 \u2192 25 red\n- cc Bb: 25 \u2192 25 checkered\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 25 plain\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nRed: 25 + 50 + 25 = 100 \u2192 wait, but that's already 100, so where does the checkered and plain come in?\n\nAh, no, the percentages add up to 100, but when converted to actual counts, each percentage represents a certain number of individuals. So if the total is 100%, the number of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% + 25% = 100% \u2192 100 individuals\nWait, but that can't be right because the remaining 25% must correspond to something else. I think I'm mixing up the contributions. Let me approach it differently. The F2 has four possible phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles:\n\n1. Checkered (Bb): Occurs in 25% of the F2 (cc Bb)\n2. Plain (bb): Occurs in 25% of the F2 (cc bb)\n3. Red (any C or B): Occurs in 50% of the F2 (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n4. Brown (any B): Occurs in 25% of the F2 (cc Bb and cc BB?), wait no. Wait, in the cc genotype, 50% have B (brown) and 50% don't (checkered). So in the F2:\n\n- Checkered (Bb): 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain (bb): 25% (cc bb)\n- Red (any C or B): 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown (any B): 25% (cc Bb)\n\nWait, but in the F2, the cc genotype contributes to both Checkered and Plain based on the B allele. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb)\n\nBut wait, the cc Bb is part of the Checkered category, and the cc BB is part of Red. Similarly, the cc Bb is part of Brown. So the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb)\n\nBut wait, that adds up to 100%.\n\nHowever, looking back at the F2, the phenotypic ratios are usually expressed as 9:3:3:1, where each part corresponds to a specific combination. In this case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: 9/16\n- Brown: 3/16\n- Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain: 1/16\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation where:\n\n- Red: 75% (12/16)\n- Brown: 37.5% (6/16)\n- Checkered: 37.5% (6/16)\n- Plain: 12.5% (2/16)\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic categories. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio in a different way, such as counting the number of each phenotype rather than their frequency. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the F2, each individual's phenotype is determined by their combination of the alleles. The phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered (Bb)\n2. Plain (bb)\n3. Red (any C or B)\n4. Brown (any B)\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb)\n\nBut wait, the cc Bb is part of both Checkered and Brown. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb) plus 25% (cc BB?) Wait no, cc BB is red, not brown. So:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb) \u2192 because B is present in 50% of cc\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n\nSo, in terms of counts (assuming 100 individuals):\n\n- Checkered: 25\n- Brown: 25\n- Red: 50\n- Plain: 25\n\nThis adds up to 100, so the phenotypic ratio is 25:25:50:25. Simplifying this, dividing each by 25 gives 1:1:2:1. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:2:1, which could correspond to checkered : brown : red : plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none seem to exactly match this. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that seems off because according to my analysis, the counts are 25:25:50:25, which simplifies to 1:1:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the order of the traits, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that I'm miscalculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\n- All individuals are F2, so their genotypes are:\n\n  25% CC BB\n  50% CB cb\n  25% Cc BB\n  25% Cc Bb\n  25% Cc bb\n  25% cc BB\n  25% cc Bb\n  25% cc bb\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CB cb: red\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: brown\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: plain\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: 25 (CC BB) + 25 (CB cb) + 25 (Cc BB) + 25 (Cc Bb) \u2192 Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, the genotypes are:\n\nWait, no: the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CB cb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CB cb: red\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: brown\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: plain\n\nNow, the counts per phenotype:\n\n- Red: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% \u2192 75\n- Brown: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 50\n- Checkered: 25% \u2192 25\n- Plain: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 50\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 75:50:25:50, which simplifies to 3:2:1:2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match the options given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That totals 16, which doesn't make sense. Option B: 8,6,2,6 \u2192 22. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16.\n\nWait, all options sum to 16, so each represents a fraction of the total 16 individuals. So, the fractions would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 6/16 \u2192 3/8\n- Checkered brown: 2/16 \u2192 1/8\n- Plain red: 6/16 \u2192 3/8\n- Plain brown: 2/16 \u2192 1/8\n\nHmm, that suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1. But according to my previous analysis, the ratio was 75:50:25:50, which is 3:2:1:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 genotypes is wrong. Let me try a different approach",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the dominant and recessive alleles. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor example, the probability of having red pigment (C present) is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc). Similarly, the probability of brown color (B present) is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red and brown. Similarly, the probability of red and checkered would be (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. The same logic applies to plain and brown, which would be (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16, and plain and checkered is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. Looking back at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the phenotypic categories. Let me double-check: If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb. The F2 would have the following genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For the pigment, C is dominant, so in the F2, all individuals with at least one C will express red pigment, regardless of the B allele. For the B gene, only those without B (i.e., with b) will express plain, while those with B will express brown. So the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: All red (regardless of B)\n- Cc: All red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: All plain (regardless of B)\n\nNow, within the cc group (all plain), half will have B and half will have b. So:\n\n- 50% of cc (which is 25% overall) will be checkered (B)\n- 50% of cc (which is 25% overall) will be plain (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Red: 75% of total (all CC, Cc, and 50% of cc)\nWait, no: CC (25%) + Cc (50%) + (50% of cc, which is 12.5%) = total 87.5%\n\nBut wait, the F2 includes four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc. Among these:\n\n- CC: all red\n- Cc: all red\n- cc: half red, half plain (but wait, no: all cc are plain, regardless of B?)\n\nWait, no, for the B gene, in the cc genotype, whether an individual is checkered or plain depends on the B allele. So, in the cc group:\n\n- Half (50%) will have B (so checkered)\n- Half (50%) will have b (so plain)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: All individuals except the cc group (since cc are plain)\nWait, no: All individuals with at least one dominant allele (for either gene) will express their respective traits. So in the F2:\n\n- CC: all red (because C is dominant)\n- Cc: all red (same reason)\n- cc: some may be checkered (if they have B) or plain (if they have b)\n\nWait, but the B gene is separate. So in the cc group:\n\n- 50% will have B (so checkered)\n- 50% will have b (so plain)\n\nTherefore, the total phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Red: All individuals except the cc group (wait, no: the cc group is all plain, but among them, half are checkered and half are plain). Wait, no, because in the F2, the cc genotype contributes to both plain and checkered based on the B gene. So the total phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\n- Total population: 100%\n- Phenotype red: All individuals who are either CC, Cc, or have at least one dominant allele in the B gene.\nWait, no: The presence of any dominant allele (either C or B) leads to the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc BB: red\n- cc bb: plain\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: plain\n\nWait, no: The presence of B means brown, and presence of b means plain. So in the cc genotype:\n\n- If an individual is cc BB: red (both C and B are dominant)\n- cc Bb: checkered (B is dominant, b is recessive)\n- cc bb: plain (no B)\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- All individuals with at least one dominant C are red, regardless of B.\n- All individuals with at least one dominant B are brown, regardless of C.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: All except those with only b alleles (cc bb)\n- Brown: Those with at least one B (including Bb and BB)\n- Checkered: Those with at least one B and at least one b (Bb)\n- Plain: Those with only b alleles (cc bb)\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2: 100 individuals.\n\nPhenotype red: All except cc bb (1 person), so 99\nBut wait, the F2 includes all possible genotypes, so:\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - All red (B present)\n   \n2. Cc (50%):\n   - All red (C present)\n   \n3. cc (25%):\n   - 50% B (checkered)\n   - 50% b (plain)\n\nSo now, converting these into numbers:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 25 (all red)\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 25 (checkered)\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 25 (plain)\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nRed: CC (25) + Cc (50) + cc BB (25) = 100? Wait, that can't be right because total should be 100. Wait, no: wait, the cc BB is 25%, which is part of the cc group, which is 25%, but in terms of counts, each percentage translates directly. So:\n\n- CC: 25 \u2192 all red\n- Cc: 50 \u2192 all red\n- cc BB: 25 \u2192 red\n- cc Bb: 25 \u2192 checkered\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 plain\n\nAdding these up:\n\nRed: 25 + 50 + 25 = 100\nCheckered: 25\nPlain: 25\n\nWait, that sums to 150%, which isn't possible. I must have made a mistake. Let me re-express it properly:\n\nThe F2 consists of 100% of individuals, broken down into the different genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - All red \u2192 25 red\n\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - All red \u2192 50 red\n\n3. cc (25%):\n   - 25% of these are cc BB \u2192 red\n   - 25% are cc Bb \u2192 checkered\n   - 25% are cc bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo, adding:\n\n- CC \u2192 25 red\n- Cc \u2192 50 red\n- cc BB \u2192 25 red\n- cc Bb \u2192 25 checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 25 plain\n\nNow, adding the reds: 25 + 50 + 25 = 100\nAdd the checkered: 25\nAdd the plain: 25\n\nWait, that still sums to 150, which is impossible. I must have miscounted. Actually, each percentage represents a portion of the 100, so:\n\n- CC: 25 \u2192 25 red\n- Cc: 50 \u2192 50 red\n- cc BB: 25 \u2192 25 red\n- cc Bb: 25 \u2192 25 checkered\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 25 plain\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nRed: 25 + 50 + 25 = 100 \u2192 wait, but that's already 100, so where does the checkered and plain come in?\n\nAh, no, the percentages add up to 100, but when converted to actual counts, each percentage represents a certain number of individuals. So if the total is 100%, the number of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% + 25% = 100% \u2192 100 individuals\nWait, but that can't be right because the remaining 25% must correspond to something else. I think I'm mixing up the contributions. Let me approach it differently. The F2 has four possible phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles:\n\n1. Checkered (Bb): Occurs in 25% of the F2 (cc Bb)\n2. Plain (bb): Occurs in 25% of the F2 (cc bb)\n3. Red (any C or B): Occurs in 50% of the F2 (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n4. Brown (any B): Occurs in 25% of the F2 (cc Bb and cc BB?), wait no. Wait, in the cc genotype, 50% have B (brown) and 50% don't (checkered). So in the F2:\n\n- Checkered (Bb): 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain (bb): 25% (cc bb)\n- Red (any C or B): 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown (any B): 25% (cc Bb)\n\nWait, but in the F2, the cc genotype contributes to both Checkered and Plain based on the B allele. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb)\n\nBut wait, the cc Bb is part of the Checkered category, and the cc BB is part of Red. Similarly, the cc Bb is part of Brown. So the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb)\n\nBut wait, that adds up to 100%.\n\nHowever, looking back at the F2, the phenotypic ratios are usually expressed as 9:3:3:1, where each part corresponds to a specific combination. In this case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: 9/16\n- Brown: 3/16\n- Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain: 1/16\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation where:\n\n- Red: 75% (12/16)\n- Brown: 37.5% (6/16)\n- Checkered: 37.5% (6/16)\n- Plain: 12.5% (2/16)\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic categories. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio in a different way, such as counting the number of each phenotype rather than their frequency. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the F2, each individual's phenotype is determined by their combination of the alleles. The phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered (Bb)\n2. Plain (bb)\n3. Red (any C or B)\n4. Brown (any B)\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb)\n\nBut wait, the cc Bb is part of both Checkered and Brown. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb) plus 25% (cc BB?) Wait no, cc BB is red, not brown. So:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc Bb)\n- Brown: 25% (cc Bb) \u2192 because B is present in 50% of cc\n- Red: 50% (CC, Cc, and cc BB)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n\nSo, in terms of counts (assuming 100 individuals):\n\n- Checkered: 25\n- Brown: 25\n- Red: 50\n- Plain: 25\n\nThis adds up to 100, so the phenotypic ratio is 25:25:50:25. Simplifying this, dividing each by 25 gives 1:1:2:1. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:2:1, which could correspond to checkered : brown : red : plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none seem to exactly match this. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that seems off because according to my analysis, the counts are 25:25:50:25, which simplifies to 1:1:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the order of the traits, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that I'm miscalculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\n- All individuals are F2, so their genotypes are:\n\n  25% CC BB\n  50% CB cb\n  25% Cc BB\n  25% Cc Bb\n  25% Cc bb\n  25% cc BB\n  25% cc Bb\n  25% cc bb\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CB cb: red\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: brown\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: plain\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: 25 (CC BB) + 25 (CB cb) + 25 (Cc BB) + 25 (Cc Bb) \u2192 Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, the genotypes are:\n\nWait, no: the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CB cb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CB cb: red\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: brown\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: plain\n\nNow, the counts per phenotype:\n\n- Red: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% \u2192 75\n- Brown: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 50\n- Checkered: 25% \u2192 25\n- Plain: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 50\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 75:50:25:50, which simplifies to 3:2:1:2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match the options given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That totals 16, which doesn't make sense. Option B: 8,6,2,6 \u2192 22. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16.\n\nWait, all options sum to 16, so each represents a fraction of the total 16 individuals. So, the fractions would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 6/16 \u2192 3/8\n- Checkered brown: 2/16 \u2192 1/8\n- Plain red: 6/16 \u2192 3/8\n- Plain brown: 2/16 \u2192 1/8\n\nHmm, that suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1. But according to my previous analysis, the ratio was 75:50:25:50, which is 3:2:1:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 genotypes is wrong. Let me try a different approach",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the probability of being dominant or recessive is 25% for each outcome if the alleles are equally likely to pass on.",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo for each gene, the probability of being dominant or recessive is 25% for each outcome if the alleles are equally likely to pass on. Wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes one allele, and there's a 50% chance of passing either allele, then for each gene, the probability of a particular allele being passed is 50% for each parent, leading to 25% for each possible combination. But since each parent contributes one allele, and both parents are heterozygous, the distribution for each gene is 25% for each possible allele. Therefore, for each gene, the phenotype is determined by whether the allele is dominant or recessive.\n\nNow, since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (dominant) = 25% \u2192 red\n- Absence of C = 75% \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (dominant) = 25% \u2192 brown\n- Absence of B = 75% \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene. That is:\n\n(Probability C present) * (Probability B present) : ... etc.\n\nBut more accurately, since each gene's outcome is independent, the total number of phenotypes depends on how many combinations of dominant and recessive alleles occur.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's list all possible genotypes in F2 and determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (for C): only if both alleles are C\n- Cc (for C): if one allele is C and the other is c\n- cc (for C): if both alleles are c\n- bb (for B): same logic for B\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- CC (C) \u00d7 bb (B): Checkered red\n- CC (C) \u00d7 bb (b): Checkered brown\n- Cc (C) \u00d7 bb (B): Checkered brown\n- Cc (C) \u00d7 bb (b): Checkered brown\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (B): Plain red\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (b): Plain brown\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (B): Plain brown\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, that seems off because some combinations might lead to different phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene is considered separately. So, for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red) \u2192 any presence of B leads to red\n- Absence of C (plain) \u2192 presence of B leads to brown, absence of B leads to checkered\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (brown) \u2192 regardless of C, leads to brown\n- Absence of B (checkered) \u2192 presence of C leads to red, absence of C leads to plain\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of dominant/recessive alleles for both genes. This creates a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a combination of C and B dominance. The phenotypic ratios can be determined by counting how many cells fall into each category.\n\nHowever, a simpler way is to note that each gene has three possible phenotypes, but due to the inheritance rules, certain combinations may not occur. Alternatively, since each gene is independently assorting, the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each gene. But since each gene can be present or absent, and they are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's effect.\n\nAlternatively, the number of phenotypic classes is limited by the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to a specific trait, and the recessive does not. So, for the F2 generation, each gene can be present or not, leading to 3 options per gene, but since they're independent, the total phenotypic classes are combinations like:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n- C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n- Both C and B recessive: Plain brown\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, each corresponding to a unique combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among these four categories.\n\nTo calculate the ratio, we can consider the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 population. Since each gene acts independently, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene contributing to that phenotype.\n\nLet's define:\n\nFor Gene C:\n\n- Presence of C (C): 25% (since each parent contributes a C with 50% chance)\n- Absence of C (c): 75%\n\nFor Gene B:\n\n- Presence of B (B): 25%\n- Absence of B (b): 75%\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (C dominant, B recessive)**:\n   - Probability of C dominant = 25%\n   - Probability of B recessive = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n\n2. **Checkered Brown (C dominant, B dominant)**:\n   - C dominant: 25%\n   - B dominant: 25%\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\n3. **Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)**:\n   - c dominant: 75%\n   - B recessive: 75%\n   - Combined: 75% * 75% = 56.25% \u2192 9/16\n\n4. **Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)**:\n   - c dominant: 75%\n   - B dominant: 25%\n   - Combined: 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n\nAdding these up: 3/16 + 1/16 + 9/16 + 3/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers for the ratio:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3 parts\n- Checkered Brown: 1 part\n- Plain Red: 9 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 3 : 1 : 9 : 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:1\nJ. 2:6\nK. 4:4\n\nOption K says 5:3, which doesn't match our calculation. Option J is 2:6, which simplifies to 1:3, also not matching. Option D is 1:3, which is 1:3, but our ratio starts with 3. Option A is 6:2, which is 3:1, similar to what we have except scaled. Our ratio is 3:1:9:3, which corresponds to option G: 12:2, which is 6:1, not matching. Option H is 5:3, nope. Option E is 3:9, which is 1:3, nope. Option F is 4:4, 1:1, nope. Option I is 7:1, nope. Option C is 9:3, which is 3:1, but our ratio is 3:1:9:3, so it's more than that. Option D is 1:3, nope. Option B is 8:4, which is 2:1, nope. Option G is 12:2, which is 6:1, still not matching. Option A is 6:2, which is 3:1, but our ratio is 3:1:9:3, so the closest is A, but it's missing the 9 and 3 parts. None of the options seem to directly match my calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check. The four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C dominant, B recessive)\n2. Checkered Brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)\n4. Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n\nFrom earlier calculations, the ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3 parts\n- Checkered Brown: 1 part\n- Plain Red: 9 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 3:1:9:3. Looking at the options, none exactly match this. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of calculating each probability, use Punnett squares for the F2 generation.\n\nParental cross is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor each of these, the phenotypes are determined by the alleles present. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThen, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (from CC \u00d7 CC)\n- Checkered Brown: 4 (from CC \u00d7 Cc, Cc \u00d7 CC, Cc \u00d7 cc, cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- Plain Red: 1 (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- Plain Brown: 4 (from Cc \u00d7 cc, cc \u00d7 Cc)\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:4:1:4, which is 1:1:4:4. Converting to a ratio by dividing each by 1:1:4:4, so the phenotypic ratio becomes 1:4:1:4.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I see the confusion. In the initial approach, I assumed that each gene's effect was independent, but in reality, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio isn't simply the product of the individual probabilities because the phenotypes are determined by the combination of dominant and recessive traits across both genes. However, in the F2 case, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 will exhibit the possible phenotypes based on the gametes.\n\nWait, going back to the Punnett square approach, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- 1/16 CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 4/16 CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1/16 cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 4/16 Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that adds up to 1+4+1+4=10/16, which suggests an error because the total should be 16/16. Let me recount:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC: 1\n- CC \u00d7 Cc: 2 (because CC can pair with each of the two Cs in Cc)\n- CC \u00d7 cc: 2\n- Cc \u00d7 CC: 2\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: 1\n- Cc \u00d7 cc: 2\n- cc \u00d7 CC: 2\n- cc \u00d7 Cc: 2\n- cc \u00d7 cc: 1\n\nWait, this method is getting complicated. Alternatively, the standard Punnett square for F2 when both parents are pure is 9 possible combinations, but in reality, considering the actual possibilities, it's 16. Hmm, maybe the initial approach is complicating things. Perhaps sticking with the initial calculation of 3:1:9:3 is better.\n\nGiven that, and looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. However, option G is 12:2, which is 6:1, but our calculation shows 3:1:9:3, which sums to 16 parts. If we scale it up, 3:1:9:3 equals 16, so scaling each part by 1, it's 3:1:9:3. However, none of the options reflect this exact ratio. The closest is option A, which is 6:2, equivalent to 3:1, but without the additional 9 and 3 parts. Option J is 2:6, which is 1:3, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4, which is 1:1, nope. Option I is 7:1, nope. Option D is 1:3, nope. Option E is 3:9, which is 1:3, nope. Option C is 9:3, which is 3:1, but again, missing the extra parts. Option G is 12:2, which is 6:1, nope. Option H is 5:3, nope. Option K is 5:3, nope. Option L is not available.

Option BY is not given. Option BZ is not given.\n\nNone of the options seem to match the 3:1:9:3 ratio. However, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The question states that the checkered pattern involves a dominant gene C and a recessive c. The red is C, brown is B. So, the F2 phenotypic ratio should indeed be based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits for both genes. Given that, and after recalculating, the ratio is 3:1:9:3, which isn't listed exactly. The closest is option G, which is 12:2, but that's 6:1, not matching. Option H is 5:3, nope. Option E is 3:9, which is 1:3, nope. Option I is 7:1, nope. Option C is 9:3, which is 3:1, again nope.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked something. The F2 generation includes the F1 (CcBb) individuals, who can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but wait, in reality, each parent can only produce one type of gamete, so CcBb would produce gametes CB and cb in a 50:50 ratio).\n\nWhen these F1 individuals (CcBb) self, the F2 would have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From each parent: CB or cb\n- So, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: C (from CB) or c (from cb)\n- Gene B: B (from CB) or b (from cb)\n\nEach gene is independent, so the possible combinations are:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for each gene, the probability of being dominant or recessive is 25% for each outcome if the alleles are equally likely to pass on. Wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes one allele, and there's a 50% chance of passing either allele, then for each gene, the probability of a particular allele being passed is 50% for each parent, leading to 25% for each possible combination. But since each parent contributes one allele, and both parents are heterozygous, the distribution for each gene is 25% for each possible allele. Therefore, for each gene, the phenotype is determined by whether the allele is dominant or recessive.\n\nNow, since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (dominant) = 25% \u2192 red\n- Absence of C = 75% \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (dominant) = 25% \u2192 brown\n- Absence of B = 75% \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene. That is:\n\n(Probability C present) * (Probability B present) : ... etc.\n\nBut more accurately, since each gene's outcome is independent, the total number of phenotypes depends on how many combinations of dominant and recessive alleles occur.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's list all possible genotypes in F2 and determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (for C): only if both alleles are C\n- Cc (for C): if one allele is C and the other is c\n- cc (for C): if both alleles are c\n- bb (for B): same logic for B\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- CC (C) \u00d7 bb (B): Checkered red\n- CC (C) \u00d7 bb (b): Checkered brown\n- Cc (C) \u00d7 bb (B): Checkered brown\n- Cc (C) \u00d7 bb (b): Checkered brown\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (B): Plain red\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (b): Plain brown\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (B): Plain brown\n- cc (c) \u00d7 bb (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, that seems off because some combinations might lead to different phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene is considered separately. So, for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red) \u2192 any presence of B leads to red\n- Absence of C (plain) \u2192 presence of B leads to brown, absence of B leads to checkered\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (brown) \u2192 regardless of C, leads to brown\n- Absence of B (checkered) \u2192 presence of C leads to red, absence of C leads to plain\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of dominant/recessive alleles for both genes. This creates a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a combination of C and B dominance. The phenotypic ratios can be determined by counting how many cells fall into each category.\n\nHowever, a simpler way is to note that each gene has three possible phenotypes, but due to the inheritance rules, certain combinations may not occur. Alternatively, since each gene is independently assorting, the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each gene. But since each gene can be present or absent, and they are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's effect.\n\nAlternatively, the number of phenotypic classes is limited by the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to a specific trait, and the recessive does not. So, for the F2 generation, each gene can be present or not, leading to 3 options per gene, but since they're independent, the total phenotypic classes are combinations like:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n- C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n- Both C and B recessive: Plain brown\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, each corresponding to a unique combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among these four categories.\n\nTo calculate the ratio, we can consider the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 population. Since each gene acts independently, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene contributing to that phenotype.\n\nLet's define:\n\nFor Gene C:\n\n- Presence of C (C): 25% (since each parent contributes a C with 50% chance)\n- Absence of C (c): 75%\n\nFor Gene B:\n\n- Presence of B (B): 25%\n- Absence of B (b): 75%\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (C dominant, B recessive)**:\n   - Probability of C dominant = 25%\n   - Probability of B recessive = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n\n2. **Checkered Brown (C dominant, B dominant)**:\n   - C dominant: 25%\n   - B dominant: 25%\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\n3. **Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)**:\n   - c dominant: 75%\n   - B recessive: 75%\n   - Combined: 75% * 75% = 56.25% \u2192 9/16\n\n4. **Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)**:\n   - c dominant: 75%\n   - B dominant: 25%\n   - Combined: 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n\nAdding these up: 3/16 + 1/16 + 9/16 + 3/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers for the ratio:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3 parts\n- Checkered Brown: 1 part\n- Plain Red: 9 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 3 : 1 : 9 : 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:1\nJ. 2:6\nK. 4:4\n\nOption K says 5:3, which doesn't match our calculation. Option J is 2:6, which simplifies to 1:3, also not matching. Option D is 1:3, which is 1:3, but our ratio starts with 3. Option A is 6:2, which is 3:1, similar to what we have except scaled. Our ratio is 3:1:9:3, which corresponds to option G: 12:2, which is 6:1, not matching. Option H is 5:3, nope. Option E is 3:9, which is 1:3, nope. Option F is 4:4, 1:1, nope. Option I is 7:1, nope. Option C is 9:3, which is 3:1, but our ratio is 3:1:9:3, so it's more than that. Option D is 1:3, nope. Option B is 8:4, which is 2:1, nope. Option G is 12:2, which is 6:1, still not matching. Option A is 6:2, which is 3:1, but our ratio is 3:1:9:3, so the closest is A, but it's missing the 9 and 3 parts. None of the options seem to directly match my calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check. The four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C dominant, B recessive)\n2. Checkered Brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)\n4. Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n\nFrom earlier calculations, the ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3 parts\n- Checkered Brown: 1 part\n- Plain Red: 9 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 3:1:9:3. Looking at the options, none exactly match this. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of calculating each probability, use Punnett squares for the F2 generation.\n\nParental cross is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor each of these, the phenotypes are determined by the alleles present. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThen, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (from CC \u00d7 CC)\n- Checkered Brown: 4 (from CC \u00d7 Cc, Cc \u00d7 CC, Cc \u00d7 cc, cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- Plain Red: 1 (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- Plain Brown: 4 (from Cc \u00d7 cc, cc \u00d7 Cc)\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:4:1:4, which is 1:1:4:4. Converting to a ratio by dividing each by 1:1:4:4, so the phenotypic ratio becomes 1:4:1:4.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I see the confusion. In the initial approach, I assumed that each gene's effect was independent, but in reality, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio isn't simply the product of the individual probabilities because the phenotypes are determined by the combination of dominant and recessive traits across both genes.

Let me recount:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC: 1\n- CC \u00d7 Cc: 2 (because CC can pair with each of the two Cs in Cc)\n- CC \u00d7 cc: 2\n- Cc \u00d7 CC: 2\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: 1\n- Cc \u00d7 cc: 2\n- cc \u00d7 CC: 2\n- cc \u00d7 Cc: 2\n- cc \u00d7 cc: 1\n\nWait, this method is getting complicated.

The question states that the checkered pattern involves a dominant gene C and a recessive c. The red is C, brown is B. So, the F2 phenotypic ratio should indeed be based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits for both genes. Given that, and after recalculating, the ratio is 3:1:9:3, which isn't listed exactly. The closest is option G, which is 12:2, but that's 6:1, not matching. Option H is 5:3, nope. Option E is 3:9, which is 1:3, nope. Option I is 7:1, nope. Option C is 9:3, which is 3:1, again nope.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked something. The F2 generation includes the F1 (CcBb) individuals, who can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but wait, in reality, each parent can only produce one type of gamete, so CcBb would produce gametes CB and cb in a 50:50 ratio).\n\nWhen these F1 individuals (CcBb) self, the F2 would have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From each parent: CB or cb\n- So, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: C (from CB) or c (from cb)\n- Gene B: B (from CB) or b (from cb)\n\nEach gene is independent, so the possible combinations are:\n\n1.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

That doesn't add up because the total should be 10. 2+6=8, plus 3+1=4, totaling 12, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps the F1 is not CcBb but another genotype. Wait, the F1 from CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous) is CcBb. So the F1 is indeed CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 should have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% probability.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

So for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the overall ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) : (3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)*(3/4) : (1/4)*(1/4).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

So for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the overall ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) : (3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)*(3/4) : (1/4)*(1/4). Calculating these:\n\n- 9/16 red brown\n- 3/16 red checkered\n- 3/16 plain brown\n- 1/16 plain checkered\n\nSo the total phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

The phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probability of each combination.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these combinations corresponds to specific phenotypes. Now, the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio among the options provided. Looking at the options, option G says the ratio is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, but if both genes are required to be recessive (checkered) for the phenotype to be plain-red, then checkered would only express when both genes are recessive. Let me calculate the probabilities.\n\nProbability of C being present (C) = 3/4 (since C is dominant, and in F2, C can be present in 3/4 cases)\nProbability of B being present (B) = 3/4\n\nThus, the probability of C present AND B present = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\n- Probability of C present AND B absent = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of C absent AND B present = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of C absent AND B absent = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo, translating into phenotypes:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red-brown (dominant for both) \u2192 count as 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-brown (C recessive, B dominant) \u2192 3/16\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain-checkered (both recessive) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of checkered red to others. Checkered red would require both genes to be recessive. That is:\n\nOnly when both C is absent (c) and B is absent (b). Which is 1/16. Similarly, checkered brown would be when C is absent (c) and B present (B), which is 3/16. Plain red would be when C is present (C) and B is absent (b), which is 3/16. And plain checkered would be when both are absent, which is 1/16.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this except option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation where checkered red is 1/16, which would translate to 1 part out of 16 total. But the options don't seem to reflect that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering dominance without counting fractions, but that seems unlikely. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the genes interact. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominant traits, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering one dominant trait per gene, but given the way the genes are presented, both are considered. Another possibility is that the question is considering the phenotype based on whether either gene is dominant or recessive, leading to different categories. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the presence of any dominant allele rather than both. Let me re-examine the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, while the color is determined by dominant C or B. So the phenotype for each pigeon depends on the presence of the dominant alleles. Thus:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, the phenotype is visible (either red or brown).\n- Only when neither C nor B is present does the phenotype become checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. Checkered: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n2. Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and B present\n3. Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B present, but also C present? Wait, no\u2014if C is present, even if B is recessive, it's red. Wait, no\u2014because if C is present (C dominant), regardless of B, the phenotype is red. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Red: Presence of C (C dominant) OR Presence of B (B dominant)\n- Brown: Presence of B (B dominant) OR Presence of C (C dominant)\n- Checkered: Both C and B are recessive (c and b)\n\nWait, but the initial statement said:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c (so the color is brown unless B is present).\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nGene C determines pigment:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nGene B determines color:\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nTherefore, a pigeon will exhibit:\n\n- Red if C is present (C dominant)\n- Brown if B is present (B dominant)\n- Checkered if both C and B are recessive (c and b)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (C present)\n2. Brown (B present)\n3. Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- The probability of having both C recessive (c) and B recessive (b) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- The probability of having C present and/or B present is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16, but broken down further:\n\n  - C present (without B) : (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n  - B present (without C) : (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n  - Both present: 9/16\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Checkered red: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Brown: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Red: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n\nBut the question is about the checkered red to others. From this, checkered red would be 3/16, brown 3/16, checkered brown 3/16, and checkered 1/16.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states:\n\nCheckered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nBut according to my calculation, plain red would be when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16, but the option D says plain red is 9. That doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of at least one dominant allele instead of both. If that's the case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: C present (regardless of B)\n- Brown: B present (regardless of C)\n- Checkered: Neither C nor B\n\nThen:\n\n- Red: C present \u2192 3/4\n- Brown: B present \u2192 3/4\n- Checkered: Neither \u2192 1/4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nRed : Brown : Checkered = 3:3:1\n\nWhich simplifies to 3 parts red, 3 parts brown, 1 part checkered. But looking at the options, none directly match this except perhaps option G, which has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nAh! So the checkered pattern is caused by the recessive allele c, meaning that the color is determined by the dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red (including checkered)\n- If B is present, the bird is brown (including checkered)\n- If neither C nor B is present, the bird is plain (checkered)\n\nWait, that changes things. Because now, the phenotype is determined by the presence of either dominant allele. So:\n\n- Checkered: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n- Red: Either C present or B present (or both)\n- Brown: Either C present or B present (or both)\n- Wait, but if both are present, it's still red or brown? No, because the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\nIf C is present (C dominant), regardless of B, the phenotype is red, including checkered.\nIf B is present (B dominant), regardless of C, the phenotype is brown, including checkered.\nIf neither is present, it's plain (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: C present\n- Brown: B present\n- Checkered: neither C nor B\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be based on the probabilities of each condition.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Probability of neither C nor B present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain checkered (but the question counts checkered as plain, so maybe that's not applicable)\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me define clearly:\n\nPlain color is when both C and B are recessive (c and b). So:\n\n- Plain color: c and b \u2192 1/16\n- Red color: C present (C dominant) \u2192 3/4\n- Brown color: B present (B dominant) \u2192 3/4\n\nBut the question is about the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. It might be asking for the distribution across the different phenotypes, considering dominance.\n\nHowever, the question specifically mentions the checkered pattern and color, implying that:\n\n- Checkered is when neither C nor B is present (plain color)\n- Red is when C is present (regardless of B)\n- Brown is when B is present (regardless of C)\n- Checkered brown would be when C is present and B is recessive?\nWait, no\u2014checkered brown would be when B is recessive (b) but C is dominant (C). Wait, no, because if C is dominant, the bird is red, not brown. So, checkered brown isn't possible. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Checkered: Neither C nor B (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n- Red: C present (regardless of B) \u2192 12/16\n- Brown: B present (regardless of C) \u2192 12/16\n- Checkered brown: Impossible because red is dominant over brown, so if C is present, the bird is red.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't mention brown checkered. It only mentions checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. Given that, let's proceed.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16\n- Red: 12/16\n- Brown: 12/16\n\nBut the options don't include 1/16, 12/16, etc. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis suggests that:\n\n- Checkered red: 12 parts\n- Checkered brown: 2 parts\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 0 parts\n\nTotal parts: 12+2+2=16\n\nBut according to our calculation, checkered brown should be 12/16, not 2/16. Similarly, checkered red should be 12/16, not 12 parts. Also, plain red should be 12/16, not 2/16, and plain brown zero. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the question is only considering the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: C present (regardless of B)\n- Brown: B present (regardless of C)\n- Checkered: Neither C nor B\n\nBut in that scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:1, as both C and B have a 3/4 chance of being present. But this doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, the actual F2 genotypes aren't equally probable because some genotypes are more likely than others. Wait, the F2 comes from a selfing of a dihybrid cross. The actual probabilities are as follows:\n\nUsing the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb and CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB, 25% Cc Bb, 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb, 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me recast it properly.\n\nWhen you self a dihybrid (CcBb), the resulting F2 genotypes follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the genes being independent. The exact probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- CC Bb: 2/16\n- CC bb: 1/16\n- Cc BB: 2/16\n- Cc Bb: 2/16\n- Cc bb: 1/16\n- cc BB: 1/16\n- cc Bb: 2/16\n- cc bb: 1/16\n\nBut wait, that sums up to 16 parts.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, the phenotype can be expressed as follows: For the C locus:\n\n  - C present \u2192 red\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, considering both genes together, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is present. The phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probability of each combination.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these combinations corresponds to specific phenotypes. Now, the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio among the options provided. Looking at the options, option G says the ratio is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, but if both genes are required to be recessive (checkered) for the phenotype to be plain-red, then checkered would only express when both genes are recessive. Let me calculate the probabilities.\n\nProbability of C being present (C) = 3/4 (since C is dominant, and in F2, C can be present in 3/4 cases)\nProbability of B being present (B) = 3/4\n\nThus, the probability of C present AND B present = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\n- Probability of C present AND B absent = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of C absent AND B present = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of C absent AND B absent = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo, translating into phenotypes:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red-brown (dominant for both) \u2192 count as 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-brown (C recessive, B dominant) \u2192 3/16\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain-checkered (both recessive) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of checkered red to others. Checkered red would require both genes to be recessive. That is:\n\nOnly when both C is absent (c) and B is absent (b). Which is 1/16. Similarly, checkered brown would be when C is absent (c) and B present (B), which is 3/16. Plain red would be when C is present (C) and B is absent (b), which is 3/16. And plain checkered would be when both are absent, which is 1/16.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this except option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation where checkered red is 1/16, which would translate to 1 part out of 16 total. But the options don't seem to reflect that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering dominance without counting fractions, but that seems unlikely. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the genes interact. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominant traits, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering one dominant trait per gene, but given the way the genes are presented, both are considered. Another possibility is that the question is considering the phenotype based on whether either gene is dominant or recessive, leading to different categories. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the presence of any dominant allele rather than both. Let me re-examine the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, while the color is determined by dominant C or B. So the phenotype for each pigeon depends on the presence of the dominant alleles. Thus:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, the phenotype is visible (either red or brown).\n- Only when neither C nor B is present does the phenotype become checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. Checkered: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n2. Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and B present\n3. Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B present, but also C present? Wait, no\u2014if C is present, even if B is recessive, it's red. Wait, no\u2014because if C is present (C dominant), regardless of B, the phenotype is red. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Red: Presence of C (C dominant) OR Presence of B (B dominant)\n- Brown: Presence of B (B dominant) OR Presence of C (C dominant)\n- Checkered: Both C and B are recessive (c and b)\n\nWait, but the initial statement said:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c (so the color is brown unless B is present).\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nGene C determines pigment:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nGene B determines color:\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nTherefore, a pigeon will exhibit:\n\n- Red if C is present (C dominant)\n- Brown if B is present (B dominant)\n- Checkered if both C and B are recessive (c and b)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (C present)\n2. Brown (B present)\n3. Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- The probability of having both C recessive (c) and B recessive (b) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- The probability of having C present and/or B present is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16, but broken down further:\n\n  - C present (without B) : (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n  - B present (without C) : (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n  - Both present: 9/16\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Checkered red: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Brown: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Red: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n\nBut the question is about the checkered red to others. From this, checkered red would be 3/16, brown 3/16, checkered brown 3/16, and checkered 1/16.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states:\n\nCheckered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nBut according to my calculation, plain red would be when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16, but the option D says plain red is 9. That doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of at least one dominant allele instead of both. If that's the case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: C present (regardless of B)\n- Brown: B present (regardless of C)\n- Checkered: Neither C nor B\n\nThen:\n\n- Red: C present \u2192 3/4\n- Brown: B present \u2192 3/4\n- Checkered: Neither \u2192 1/4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nRed : Brown : Checkered = 3:3:1\n\nWhich simplifies to 3 parts red, 3 parts brown, 1 part checkered. But looking at the options, none directly match this except perhaps option G, which has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nAh! So the checkered pattern is caused by the recessive allele c, meaning that the color is determined by the dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red (including checkered)\n- If B is present, the bird is brown (including checkered)\n- If neither C nor B is present, the bird is plain (checkered)\n\nWait, that changes things. Because now, the phenotype is determined by the presence of either dominant allele. So:\n\n- Checkered: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n- Red: Either C present or B present (or both)\n- Brown: Either C present or B present (or both)\n- Wait, but if both are present, it's still red or brown? No, because the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\nIf C is present (C dominant), regardless of B, the phenotype is red, including checkered.\nIf B is present (B dominant), regardless of C, the phenotype is brown, including checkered.\nIf neither is present, it's plain (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: C present\n- Brown: B present\n- Checkered: neither C nor B\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be based on the probabilities of each condition.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Probability of neither C nor B present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain checkered (but the question counts checkered as plain, so maybe that's not applicable)\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me define clearly:\n\nPlain color is when both C and B are recessive (c and b). So:\n\n- Plain color: c and b \u2192 1/16\n- Red color: C present (C dominant) \u2192 3/4\n- Brown color: B present (B dominant) \u2192 3/4\n\nBut the question is about the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. It might be asking for the distribution across the different phenotypes, considering dominance.\n\nHowever, the question specifically mentions the checkered pattern and color, implying that:\n\n- Checkered is when neither C nor B is present (plain color)\n- Red is when C is present (regardless of B)\n- Brown is when B is present (regardless of C)\n- Checkered brown would be when C is present and B is recessive?\nWait, no\u2014checkered brown would be when B is recessive (b) but C is dominant (C). Wait, no, because if C is dominant, the bird is red, not brown. So, checkered brown isn't possible. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Checkered: Neither C nor B (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n- Red: C present (regardless of B) \u2192 12/16\n- Brown: B present (regardless of C) \u2192 12/16\n- Checkered brown: Impossible because red is dominant over brown, so if C is present, the bird is red.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't mention brown checkered. It only mentions checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. Given that, let's proceed.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16\n- Red: 12/16\n- Brown: 12/16\n\nBut the options don't include 1/16, 12/16, etc. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis suggests that:\n\n- Checkered red: 12 parts\n- Checkered brown: 2 parts\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 0 parts\n\nTotal parts: 12+2+2=16\n\nBut according to our calculation, checkered brown should be 12/16, not 2/16. Similarly, checkered red should be 12/16, not 12 parts. Also, plain red should be 12/16, not 2/16, and plain brown zero. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the question is only considering the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: C present (regardless of B)\n- Brown: B present (regardless of C)\n- Checkered: Neither C nor B\n\nBut in that scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:1, as both C and B have a 3/4 chance of being present. But this doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

The actual probabilities are as follows:\n\nUsing the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb and CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB, 25% Cc Bb, 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb, 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me recast it properly.\n\nWhen you self a dihybrid (CcBb), the resulting F2 genotypes follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the genes being independent. The exact probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- CC Bb: 2/16\n- CC bb: 1/16\n- Cc BB: 2/16\n- Cc Bb: 2/16\n- Cc bb: 1/16\n- cc BB: 1/16\n- cc Bb: 2/16\n- cc bb: 1/16\n\nBut wait, that sums up to 16 parts.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming dominance, each gene shows the dominant trait if the allele is present.",
    "rollout": " Assuming dominance, each gene shows the dominant trait if the allele is present. So, for each gene, the probability of being dominant is 75%, recessive is 25%, because each allele is either dominant or recessive, and each has a 50% chance. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it shows the dominant trait. So for each gene, the probability of showing the dominant trait is 75%, recessive is 25%.\n\nSo, for the F2 population, the number of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB (C present, B present): red brown\n- CC Bb (C present, B absent): red checkered\n- CC bb (C present, b present): red checkered\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because bb would mean both alleles are recessive. So, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the dominant trait.\n\nBut when considering the F2 generation, the possible combinations of traits are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): red brown\n2. Pigment dominant (C) but color recessive (b): red checkered\n3. Pigment recessive (c) but color dominant (B): plain brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and color recessive (b): plain checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each combination are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Since each gene is independent, the total probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 75%\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 25%\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. C and B: 75% * 75% = 56.25% \u2192 red brown\n2. C and b: 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 red checkered\n3. c and B: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 plain brown\n4. c and b: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 plain checkered\n\nAdding them up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 total 16, which doesn't match our 56+18+18+6=100.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16, doesn't fit.\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 20, doesn't fit.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 same as option C.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, doesn't fit.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to add up to 100. That suggests I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different scenario where the parents are different than what was stated. Let me double-check the parent genotypes. Wait, the user wrote the parents as CC BB (hom homozygous dominant) and cc bb (hom homozygous recessive). Yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't considered here, but rather the F1 and F2. But the question asks specifically for F2. Hmm. Maybe there's another approach. Perhaps the parents are crossed to produce a F1, then F1 x F1 to get F2. So, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 x F1 would produce F2 as I thought before. So, the F2 would have 9 types of genotypes, each with certain phenotypes.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio would be 56.25% red brown, 18.75% red checkered, 18.75% plain brown, 6.25% plain checkered. But none of the options match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A-F: All the ratios don't align except maybe G and H. Option G says 12,2,2,2, which sums to 20. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16. None add to 100. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, but that would be incorrect because the options suggest a different outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the dominant trait. So:\n\nProbability of red (C present): 75% \u2192 0.75\nProbability of brown (B present): 75% \u2192 0.75\n\nThe probability of having both traits is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 red brown.\n\nProbability of red and not brown (C present, B absent): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 red checkered.\n\nProbability of not red (c present) and brown (B present): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 plain brown.\n\nProbability of neither red nor brown: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 plain checkered.\n\nThus, the ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. If we scale this up by multiplying each part by 16 (to eliminate decimals), we get 900 : 300 : 300 : 100. Simplifying further, dividing each by 100: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Which matches option J: 2,6,3,1. Wait, no\u2014option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12. Wait, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, scaling by 16: 56.25*16=900, 18.75*16=300, etc. Dividing by 100 gives 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option J's numbers scaled down by a factor of 6 (since J is 2,6,3,1, which is 9/4.5=2, etc.). So, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option J when scaled appropriately.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J is \"Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.\" But wait, our calculations gave 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option J if each number is divided by 4.5 (9/4.5=2, 3/4.5\u22480.666, but that doesn't match). Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider all alleles equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, hence option D: 1,3,9,3, which doesn't fit. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotype ratio, not the genotypic ratio. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each phenotype. According to our previous calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts red-brown, 3 parts red-checkered, 3 parts plain-brown, 1 part plain-checkered. Adding up to 16 parts. To express this as a ratio among the options, we'd need to adjust it to match the options. Looking at option J: 2,6,3,1. That's exactly 9:3:3:1 divided by 4.5, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Maybe the options represent the count of each phenotype, not the proportion. So, for example, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total of 12 birds. But according to our calculation, the actual counts should be 9,3,3,1, totaling 16. So, none of the options perfectly match. This suggests that perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Summing these gives 16, which contradicts our calculation. Similarly, option B is 8,4,0,4 which sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,2 which also sums to 18. Option H is 5,3,2,6 which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3 which sums to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4 which sums to 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3 which sums to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2 which sums to 16.\n\nNone of these options seem to match our 9:3:3:1 ratio, unless I've made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the user wrote the parents as CC BB and cc bb. So, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross involves the F1, not the F2. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the cross is adi hybrid between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), then F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield F2. As previously calculated, the F2 genotypes would have a ratio of 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this exact ratio. However, option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, while option J is 2,6,3,1, which is half of that. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, but without considering dominance (which would lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio). But that's not standard practice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Given that none of the options perfectly match our calculated ratio, but looking closely, option J is the closest. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try recalculating the probabilities without relying on percentages but directly using the 3x3 grid method.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities: dominant (D) and recessive (d). For each gene, the probability of D is 75% and d is 25%. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. So, for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\nGene C (dominant):\n- C (probability 0.75)\n- c (probability 0.25)\n\nGene B (dominant):\n- B (probability 0.75)\n- b (probability 0.25)\n\nThe possible combinations are 3\u00d73=9. Each combination has a probability of 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (for both dominant), 0.75*0.25=0.1875 (C dominant, b), 0.25*0.75=0.1875 (c, B dominant), and 0.25*0.25=0.0625 (both recessive).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): 0.5625 \u2192 red brown\n2. C dominant, b (C and b): 0.1875 \u2192 red checkered\n3. c, B dominant (c and B): 0.1875 \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both recessive (c and b): 0.0625 \u2192 plain checkered\n\nTo convert these into whole numbers, we can scale them up. Let's choose a multiplier such that the smallest probability (0.0625) becomes 1. Multiplying each by 16 gives:\n\n1. 0.5625 * 16 = 9\n2. 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n3. 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n4. 0.0625 * 16 = 1\n\nThis results in a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which is consistent with our earlier calculation. Comparing this to the options:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented in a way that sums to 16, which is the denominator used. For instance, option J's sum is 2+6+3+1=12, but our ratio is 16. So, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be expressed per 16, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, maybe the options are simplified fractions, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven that none of the options perfectly match our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option J is the closest in terms of the ratios (9:3:3:1 vs. 2:6:3:1), but scaled down by a factor of 4.5, which is impractical. Alternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect, but given the choices, option J is the most plausible despite the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the options, I realize that option J has 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, whereas our calculation requires 16. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the correct ratio, suggesting a possible error in the question or the options. Given the available choices, option J is the closest in terms of the ratio components, albeit scaled incorrectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

C and b: 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 red checkered\n3. c and B: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 plain brown\n4. c and b: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 plain checkered\n\nAdding them up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 total 16, which doesn't match our 56+18+18+6=100.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16, doesn't fit.\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 20, doesn't fit.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 same as option C.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't fit.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, doesn't fit.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to add up to 100. That suggests I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different scenario where the parents are different than what was stated. Let me double-check the parent genotypes. Wait, the user wrote the parents as CC BB (hom homozygous dominant) and cc bb (hom homozygous recessive). Yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't considered here, but rather the F1 and F2. But the question asks specifically for F2. Hmm. Maybe there's another approach. Perhaps the parents are crossed to produce a F1, then F1 x F1 to get F2. So, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 x F1 would produce F2 as I thought before. So, the F2 would have 9 types of genotypes, each with certain phenotypes.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio would be 56.25% red brown, 18.75% red checkered, 18.75% plain brown, 6.25% plain checkered. But none of the options match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A-F: All the ratios don't align except maybe G and H. Option G says 12,2,2,2, which sums to 20. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16. None add to 100. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, but that would be incorrect because the options suggest a different outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the dominant trait. So:\n\nProbability of red (C present): 75% \u2192 0.75\nProbability of brown (B present): 75% \u2192 0.75\n\nThe probability of having both traits is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 red brown.\n\nProbability of red and not brown (C present, B absent): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 red checkered.\n\nProbability of not red (c present) and brown (B present): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 plain brown.\n\nProbability of neither red nor brown: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 plain checkered.\n\nThus, the ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. If we scale this up by multiplying each part by 16 (to eliminate decimals), we get 900 : 300 : 300 : 100. Simplifying further, dividing each by 100: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Which matches option J: 2,6,3,1. Wait, no\u2014option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12. Wait, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, scaling by 16: 56.25*16=900, 18.75*16=300, etc. Dividing by 100 gives 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option J's numbers scaled down by a factor of 6 (since J is 2,6,3,1, which is 9/4.5=2, etc.). So, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option J when scaled appropriately.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J is \"Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.\" But wait, our calculations gave 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option J if each number is divided by 4.5 (9/4.5=2, 3/4.5\u22480.666, but that doesn't match). Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider all alleles equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, hence option D: 1,3,9,3, which doesn't fit. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotype ratio, not the genotypic ratio. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each phenotype. According to our previous calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts red-brown, 3 parts red-checkered, 3 parts plain-brown, 1 part plain-checkered. Adding up to 16 parts. To express this as a ratio among the options, we'd need to adjust it to match the options. Looking at option J: 2,6,3,1. That's exactly 9:3:3:1 divided by 4.5, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Maybe the options represent the count of each phenotype, not the proportion. So, for example, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total of 12 birds. But according to our calculation, the actual counts should be 9,3,3,1, totaling 16. So, none of the options perfectly match. This suggests that perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Summing these gives 16, which contradicts our calculation. Similarly, option B is 8,4,0,4 which sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,2 which also sums to 18. Option H is 5,3,2,6 which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3 which sums to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4 which sums to 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3 which sums to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2 which sums to 16.\n\nNone of these options seem to match our 9:3:3:1 ratio, unless I've made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the user wrote the parents as CC BB and cc bb. So, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross involves the F1, not the F2. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the cross is adi hybrid between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), then F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield F2. As previously calculated, the F2 genotypes would have a ratio of 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this exact ratio. However, option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, while option J is 2,6,3,1, which is half of that. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, but without considering dominance (which would lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio). But that's not standard practice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Given that none of the options perfectly match our calculated ratio, but looking closely, option J is the closest. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try recalculating the probabilities without relying on percentages but directly using the 3x3 grid method.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities: dominant (D) and recessive (d). For each gene, the probability of D is 75% and d is 25%. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. So, for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\nGene C (dominant):\n- C (probability 0.75)\n- c (probability 0.25)\n\nGene B (dominant):\n- B (probability 0.75)\n- b (probability 0.25)\n\nThe possible combinations are 3\u00d73=9. Each combination has a probability of 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (for both dominant), 0.75*0.25=0.1875 (C dominant, b), 0.25*0.75=0.1875 (c, B dominant), and 0.25*0.25=0.0625 (both recessive).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): 0.5625 \u2192 red brown\n2. C dominant, b (C and b): 0.1875 \u2192 red checkered\n3. c, B dominant (c and B): 0.1875 \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both recessive (c and b): 0.0625 \u2192 plain checkered\n\nTo convert these into whole numbers, we can scale them up. Let's choose a multiplier such that the smallest probability (0.0625) becomes 1. Multiplying each by 16 gives:\n\n1. 0.5625 * 16 = 9\n2. 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n3. 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n4. 0.0625 * 16 = 1\n\nThis results in a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which is consistent with our earlier calculation. Comparing this to the options:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented in a way that sums to 16, which is the denominator used. For instance, option J's sum is 2+6+3+1=12, but our ratio is 16. So, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be expressed per 16, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, maybe the options are simplified fractions, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven that none of the options perfectly match our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option J is the closest in terms of the ratios (9:3:3:1 vs. 2:6:3:1), but scaled down by a factor of 4.5, which is impractical. Alternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect, but given the choices, option J is the most plausible despite the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the options, I realize that option J has 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, whereas our calculation requires 16. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the correct ratio, suggesting a possible error in the question or the options. Given the available choices, option J is the closest in terms of the ratio components, albeit scaled incorrectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming each gene is assorting independently.",
    "rollout": " Assuming each gene is assorting independently.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: For each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- For C (gene C):\n  - If C is present (e.g., dominant allele), the phenotype is red.\n  - If c is present, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- If B is present (dominant), phenotype is brown.\n- If b is present, phenotype is checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nSo for the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (assuming each parent contributes equally). Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the parents are homozygous recessive. Let me re-examine the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB, so both C and B are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so both are recessive. Therefore, when crossed, the F1 is CcBb. Now, the F2 will be the result of F1 selfing, where each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor gene C:\n\n- F1: Cc\n- Gametes: 50% C, 50% c\n- So phenotypes: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- F1: Bb\n- Gametes: 50% B, 50% b\n- Phenotypes: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So for each gene, there are three possible combinations (like RR, Rr, Rr, rr), but wait, in terms of dominance, it's either dominant or recessive. However, since both genes are acting independently, the total phenotypic ratio is 3x3=9 possible phenotypes, but many may combine into fewer categories due to dominance.\n\nBut wait, in the case of dihybrid crosses with two genes each having two traits, the number of phenotypic classes is usually up to nine if each trait is completely dominant. However, if one trait masks another, some classes might merge. In this case, since both genes are being expressed, and the presence of any dominant allele leads to a particular phenotype, the phenotypic ratio would still follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, except that each trait is expressed independently.\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are working together, the phenotypic ratio isn't exactly 9:3:3:1 because the expression can sometimes lead to incomplete dominance or masking, but the question doesn't mention such complexities, so I'll assume complete dominance and no masking. Therefore, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio for F2 would be 9:3:3:1, but how does that translate into actual counts?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, leading to 3x3 = 9 phenotypic classes. Each class corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. However, in reality, the number of distinct phenotypes is often less than nine because certain combinations might result in the same phenotype. For example, if one trait masks the other, then some classes might be grouped. But given that the question specifies \"the expected phenotypic ratio,\" without specifying dominance, perhaps it assumes that each combination leads to a unique phenotype, hence 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, since both genes are acting independently, each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes would result in a unique phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the following:\n\n- Both dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n- C_B_: red brown\n- C_b_: red checkered\n- c_B_: plain brown\n- c_B_: plain brown\n- c_b_: plain checkered\n- c_B_: plain brown\n- c_b_: plain checkered\n- c_b_: plain checkered\n\nWait, that seems off because 9:3:3:1 adds up to 16, but we have four phenotypes. Wait, no, the phenotypic ratio refers to the proportion of each phenotype among the total population. So, the actual numbers would be divided according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but in our case, each gene contributes to the phenotype. Let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_): Frequency is (1/2)(1/2) * (1/2)(1/2) = 1/16\n2. C_B_: same as above\n3. C_b_: same\n4. c_B_: same\n5. c_B_: same\n6. c_b_: same\n7. c_B_: same\n8. c_b_: same\n9. c_b_: same\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, the correct way is to compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C_B_) \u2192 Probability = (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 1/16\n\nPhenotype 2: One dominant, one recessive for C \u2192 Can be C_B_ or C_b_, each with 1/4 chance. Wait, no\u2014actually, the probability for C_B_ is 1/4, and C_b_ is also 1/4. Similarly, for B_:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 1/16\n\nPhenotype 2: One dominant, one recessive for C \u2192 2*(1/4) = 1/2\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, leading to 9 possible phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts: 3 for each dominant trait combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list them:\n\nPhenotype A: Both dominant (C_B_) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3 of the total\n\nPhenotype B: One dominant, one recessive (either C_B_ or C_b_) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nPhenotype C: One dominant, one recessive (either C_B_ or C_b_) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, the correct breakdown is:\n\nEach gene has 3:1 ratio, leading to 9 phenotypic classes. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- 9/16 of the population exhibits the first phenotype\n- 3/16 exhibit the second\n- 3/16 exhibit the third\n- 1/16 exhibit the fourth\n\nBut in the context of the question, the options don't include 9:3:3:1, so perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of phenotypes rather than the exact ratio. Looking back at the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option J says 2,6,3,1, summing to 12. Option D says 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option E says 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option H says 5,3,2,6, summing to 16.\n\nWait, none of these options directly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of phenotypes observed instead of the ratio, but looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1\u2014which sums to 12. That seems low. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the four phenotypes, ignoring dominance and assuming all dominant traits are expressed fully.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the answer options do not align with my calculations. Let me try a different approach. Since each gene has two alleles, and the F2 generation is produced by selfing the F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (CB + CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc (CB + cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n\nNow, applying the color rules:\n\n- For C (pigment):\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- For B (color):\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of these two traits. Using the Punnett square:\n\n1. All CC individuals (25%) will have C for pigment and B for color. So, red brown (since both C and B are dominant).\n2. All Cc individuals (50%) will have C for pigment and B for color. So, red brown as well.\n3. All cc individuals (25%) will have c for pigment and b for color. So, plain checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: 75% (25% + 50%)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (25%)\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. If both pigment and color are dominant, then:\n\n- If both are dominant (C_B_), phenotype is red brown\n- If pigment is dominant (C_), color is recessive (b) \u2192 plain checkered\n- Pigmented is recessive (c), color dominant (B) \u2192 red brown\n- Pigmented and color recessive \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, that's the same conclusion as before. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 75% (three cases)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (one case)\n\nBut the options don't seem to account for this. Let me look again at the options provided. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12, which doesn't make sense because 75% should be red brown and 25% plain checkered, totaling 100%.\n\nOption D is 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. This suggests that the phenotypes are distributed as follows: 1 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain brown, 3 checkered red. But that doesn't fit with the previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied dominance. Let me clarify: If both pigment and color are dominant, then:\n\n- C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n- C_b_ \u2192 red checkered\n- c_B_ \u2192 plain brown\n- c_b_ \u2192 plain checkered\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 75%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n\nWhich sums to 100%, as expected.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly matches this. However, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This distribution implies that:\n\n- Plain red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n\nThis doesn't align with the previous calculation. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe question mentions \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014no, I think I misread earlier. The\u7236\u6bcd are a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but in my initial analysis, I considered F1 as CC BB and cc bb, which led to an incorrect F1. The correct F1 should be CcBb, as each parent can only produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, the correct F2 would be as follows:\n\nGametes from F1: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is to combine the gametes:\n\n- From F1, each parent produces CB or cb gametes.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cC, and cc, each occurring at 25% frequency.\n\nApplying the dominance rules:\n\n- CC: red (because C is dominant)\n- Cc: red (because C is dominant)\n- cc: plain (because c is recessive)\n- Cc: red (again, C dominant)\n\nWait, but Cc can be either C dominant (red) or c recessive (plain). So for the C locus, regardless of the B locus, if C is present, the phenotype is red. Only when both C and c are absent (i.e., cc) does the phenotype change to plain.\n\nNow, applying this to the B locus:\n\n- BB: brown (since B is dominant)\n- Bb: brown (B dominant)\n- bb: checkered (b recessive)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes depend on both loci.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming each gene is assorting independently.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: For each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- For C (gene C):\n  - If C is present (e.g., dominant allele), the phenotype is red.\n  - If c is present, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- If B is present (dominant), phenotype is brown.\n- If b is present, phenotype is checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nSo for the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (assuming each parent contributes equally). Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the parents are homozygous recessive. Let me re-examine the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB, so both C and B are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so both are recessive. Therefore, when crossed, the F1 is CcBb. Now, the F2 will be the result of F1 selfing, where each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor gene C:\n\n- F1: Cc\n- Gametes: 50% C, 50% c\n- So phenotypes: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- F1: Bb\n- Gametes: 50% B, 50% b\n- Phenotypes: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So for each gene, there are three possible combinations (like RR, Rr, Rr, rr), but wait, in terms of dominance, it's either dominant or recessive. However, since both genes are acting independently, the total phenotypic ratio is 3x3=9 possible phenotypes, but many may combine into fewer categories due to dominance.\n\nBut wait, in the case of dihybrid crosses with two genes each having two traits, the number of phenotypic classes is usually up to nine if each trait is completely dominant. However, if one trait masks another, some classes might merge. In this case, since both genes are being expressed, and the presence of any dominant allele leads to a particular phenotype, the phenotypic ratio would still follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, except that each trait is expressed independently.\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are working together, the phenotypic ratio isn't exactly 9:3:3:1 because the expression can sometimes lead to incomplete dominance or masking, but the question doesn't mention such complexities, so I'll assume complete dominance and no masking. Therefore, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio for F2 would be 9:3:3:1, but how does that translate into actual counts?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, leading to 3x3 = 9 phenotypic classes. Each class corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. However, in reality, the number of distinct phenotypes is often less than nine because certain combinations might result in the same phenotype. For example, if one trait masks the other, then some classes might be grouped. But given that the question specifies \"the expected phenotypic ratio,\" without specifying dominance, perhaps it assumes that each combination leads to a unique phenotype, hence 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, since both genes are acting independently, each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes would result in a unique phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the following:\n\n- Both dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n- C_B_: red brown\n- C_b_: red checkered\n- c_B_: plain brown\n- c_B_: plain brown\n- c_b_: plain checkered\n- c_B_: plain brown\n- c_b_: plain checkered\n- c_b_: plain checkered\n\nWait, that seems off because 9:3:3:1 adds up to 16, but we have four phenotypes. Wait, no, the phenotypic ratio refers to the proportion of each phenotype among the total population. So, the actual numbers would be divided according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but in our case, each gene contributes to the phenotype. Let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_): Frequency is (1/2)(1/2) * (1/2)(1/2) = 1/16\n2. C_B_: same as above\n3. C_b_: same\n4. c_B_: same\n5. c_B_: same\n6. c_b_: same\n7. c_B_: same\n8. c_b_: same\n9. c_b_: same\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, the correct way is to compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C_B_) \u2192 Probability = (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 1/16\n\nPhenotype 2: One dominant, one recessive for C \u2192 Can be C_B_ or C_b_, each with 1/4 chance. Wait, no\u2014actually, the probability for C_B_ is 1/4, and C_b_ is also 1/4. Similarly, for B_:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 1/16\n\nPhenotype 2: One dominant, one recessive for C \u2192 2*(1/4) = 1/2\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, leading to 9 possible phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts: 3 for each dominant trait combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list them:\n\nPhenotype A: Both dominant (C_B_) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3 of the total\n\nPhenotype B: One dominant, one recessive (either C_B_ or C_b_) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nPhenotype C: One dominant, one recessive (either C_B_ or C_b_) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, the correct breakdown is:\n\nEach gene has 3:1 ratio, leading to 9 phenotypic classes. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- 9/16 of the population exhibits the first phenotype\n- 3/16 exhibit the second\n- 3/16 exhibit the third\n- 1/16 exhibit the fourth\n\nBut in the context of the question, the options don't include 9:3:3:1, so perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of phenotypes rather than the exact ratio. Looking back at the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option J says 2,6,3,1, summing to 12. Option D says 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option E says 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option H says 5,3,2,6, summing to 16.\n\nWait, none of these options directly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of phenotypes observed instead of the ratio, but looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1\u2014which sums to 12. That seems low. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the four phenotypes, ignoring dominance and assuming all dominant traits are expressed fully.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the answer options do not align with my calculations. Let me try a different approach. Since each gene has two alleles, and the F2 generation is produced by selfing the F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (CB + CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc (CB + cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n\nNow, applying the color rules:\n\n- For C (pigment):\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- For B (color):\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of these two traits. Using the Punnett square:\n\n1. All CC individuals (25%) will have C for pigment and B for color. So, red brown (since both C and B are dominant).\n2. All Cc individuals (50%) will have C for pigment and B for color. So, red brown as well.\n3. All cc individuals (25%) will have c for pigment and b for color. So, plain checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: 75% (25% + 50%)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (25%)\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. If both pigment and color are dominant, then:\n\n- If both are dominant (C_B_), phenotype is red brown\n- If pigment is dominant (C_), color is recessive (b) \u2192 plain checkered\n- Pigmented is recessive (c), color dominant (B) \u2192 red brown\n- Pigmented and color recessive \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, that's the same conclusion as before. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 75% (three cases)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (one case)\n\nBut the options don't seem to account for this. Let me look again at the options provided. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12, which doesn't make sense because 75% should be red brown and 25% plain checkered, totaling 100%.\n\nOption D is 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. This suggests that the phenotypes are distributed as follows: 1 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain brown, 3 checkered red. But that doesn't fit with the previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied dominance. Let me clarify: If both pigment and color are dominant, then:\n\n- C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n- C_b_ \u2192 red checkered\n- c_B_ \u2192 plain brown\n- c_b_ \u2192 plain checkered\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 75%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n\nWhich sums to 100%, as expected.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly matches this. However, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This distribution implies that:\n\n- Plain red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n\nThis doesn't align with the previous calculation. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe question mentions \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014no, I think I misread earlier. The\u7236\u6bcd are a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but in my initial analysis, I considered F1 as CC BB and cc bb, which led to an incorrect F1. The correct F1 should be CcBb, as each parent can only produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, the correct F2 would be as follows:\n\nGametes from F1: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is to combine the gametes:\n\n- From F1, each parent produces CB or cb gametes.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cC, and cc, each occurring at 25% frequency.\n\nApplying the dominance rules:\n\n- CC: red (because C is dominant)\n- Cc: red (because C is dominant)\n- cc: plain (because c is recessive)\n- Cc: red (again, C dominant)\n\nWait, but Cc can be either C dominant (red) or c recessive (plain). So for the C locus, regardless of the B locus, if C is present, the phenotype is red. Only when both C and c are absent (i.e., cc) does the phenotype change to plain.\n\nNow, applying this to the B locus:\n\n- BB: brown (since B is dominant)\n- Bb: brown (B dominant)\n- bb: checkered (b recessive)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes depend on both loci. Let's create a grid:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 red brown\nPhenotype 2: C_b_ \u2192 red checkered\nPhenotype 3: c_B_ \u2192 plain brown\nPhenotype 4: c_b_ \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- For C_B_:\n  - Frequency = (1/2 C from F1) * (1/2 B from F1) * (1/2 C from F1) * (1/2 B from F1) \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) * (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/16\n- For C_b_:\n  - Frequency = (1/2 C * 1/2 B) + (1/2 C * 1/2 B) \u2192 2 * (1/4 * 1/4) = 2/16\n- For c_B_:\n  - Frequency = (1/2 c * 1/2 B) * (1/2 c * 1/2 B) = 1/16\n- For c_b_:\n  - Frequency = 2 * (1/2 c * 1/2 B * 1/2 c * 1/2 b) \u2192 2/16\n\nAdding them up:\n\n- Red Brown: 1+2 = 3/16\n- Red Checkered: 2/16\n- Plain Brown: 1/16\n- Plain Checkered: 2/16\n\nTotal: 3+2+1+2 = 8, which is incorrect because we have 16 possible outcomes. Wait, that must mean I messed up the addition. Let's recalculate:\n\nActually, the correct frequencies are:\n\n- C_B_: (1/2 * 1/2) * (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/16 (for each C and B allele)\n- C_b_: 2 * (1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2) = 2/16\n- c_B_: (1/2 * 1/2) * (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/16\n- c_b_: 2 * (1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2) = 2/16\n\nSo adding them:\n\nRed Brown (3 parts): 1+2 = 3\nRed Checkered (2 parts): 2\nPlain Brown (1 part): 1\nPlain Checkered (2 parts): 2\n\nTotal parts: 8, but we have 16 possible outcomes.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but the actual phenotypes are combinations of these.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, but the actual phenotypes are combinations of these. For example, if a bird has both dominant alleles for C and B, it's red and brown, which is likely brown and red depending on dominance, but typically, if B is dominant, then brown would be expressed even without B, but in reality, B is often epistatic over b. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider each gene separately and then combine them. \n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the phenotypic expression. For the C locus: If either C or c is present, the phenotype is red. Only when c is present (i.e., cc genotype) does it become plain. Similarly, for the B locus: If B is present, the bird is brown; if b is present, it's checkered. But wait, the checkered phenotype (b) is more common than the plain (c) phenotype. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nNow, considering the possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, each bird has a genotype for C and another for B. To determine the phenotype, we look at each gene separately and then combine them. For example, a bird with genotype CcBb would have both C and B dominant, leading to red and brown, resulting in a dark brown bird, but more commonly, brown might override checkered. Wait, but checkered is when both genes are recessive. So, checkered is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., cc bb. Other combinations where at least one allele is dominant lead to some coloration, but sometimes dominance relationships can vary. For example, if B is dominant over b, then even if the bird is bb (only c), it would express B, making it brown. Similarly, if B is not dominant, but c is, then it remains plain. But wait, in our case, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of whether it also has a b allele. So, checkered (bb) only shows up if both alleles are recessive for B and recessive for C. Otherwise, the bird will be brown or red based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states that checkered color is determined by the recessive allele c for gene C and the recessive allele b for gene B. So, checkered is when both C and B are recessive: cc bb. All other cases will display some coloration. Since B is dominant, any bird with at least one B allele will express brown, overriding the effect of B being dominant. So, the presence of B (either dominant or recessive) leads to brown, while the presence of c leads to plain. Similarly, for C, any presence of C leads to red, and c leads to plain. However, in practice, the dominance hierarchy may affect the outcome. In most cases, the presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of c, so a bird with Bb will be brown, regardless of having c. Similarly, a bird with cB will still be brown. But wait, that contradicts my earlier understanding. Let me get back to the basics.\n\nIn genetics, when dealing with multiple loci, the order of dominance matters. Typically, the first gene (first in the order given) is considered more influential. So, if B is dominant over b, then any bird with at least one B allele will exhibit brown color, irrespective of whether it also has a b allele. Similarly, if C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will be red, regardless of b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered (cc bb): Both genes are recessive.\n- Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.): At least one of the genes is recessive.\n- Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.): At least one of the genes is dominant (B).\n- Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.): At least one of the genes is dominant (C).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if B is dominant, then any bird with B will be brown, regardless of c. Similarly, any bird with C will be red, regardless of b. So, the presence of either dominant allele in either gene leads to that color. Therefore, checkered only occurs when both are recessive. Otherwise, if either is dominant, the bird will be brown or red, depending on which gene is dominant.\n\nGiven that, let's model the possible F2 phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered (cc bb)**: Occurs when both genes are recessive. The probability of this happening is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\n2. **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.)**: This includes all cases where at least one gene is recessive. The probability is 1 - (probability of both genes being dominant). Probability of C being dominant is 3/4 (since C is present in all F2 except cc), same for B. So, probability both genes are dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Thus, probability of at least one gene being recessive (i.e., plain) is 1 - 9/16=7/16.\n\n3. **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, etc.)**: This includes all cases where at least one gene is dominant. The probability is 1 - (probability both genes are recessive). Probability both genes are recessive is 1/16 (cc bb). So, probability brown is 15/16.\n\n4. **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: All cases where at least one gene is dominant. Probability is 1 - (probability both genes recessive) = 15/16.\n\nWait, but this seems off because the sum of probabilities should add up to 1. Let's double-check:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 \u2248 0.0625\n- Plain: 7/16 \u2248 0.4375\n- Brown: 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n- Red: 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nAdding these gives 1/16 + 7/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = (1+7+15+15)/16 = 38/16 > 1, which is impossible. That indicates a mistake in calculation. Clearly, there's an error here.\n\nAh, I see. The issue arises because in reality, not all combinations are equally probable when considering multiple loci. Specifically, the presence of one allele affects the likelihood of the others due to dominance and linkage. But in this problem, I assume independent assortment, so each gamete carries alleles independently. Therefore, the probabilities should be additive.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\u22480.0625\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc bb, ...)**: Any bird where at least one gene is recessive. The total probability is 1 - (probability both genes are dominant). Probability both genes are dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. So, probability at least one gene is recessive is 1 - 9/16=7/16\u22480.4375\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Probability is 1 - (probability both genes are recessive) = 1 - 1/16=15/16\u22480.9375\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Same as above, 15/16\u22480.9375\n\nWait, adding these together: 1/16 + 7/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = (1+7+15+15)/16=38/16=2.375, which exceeds 1. That's impossible, so clearly, my approach is flawed. Perhaps I misapplied the principles of inheritance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the presence of B ensures brown, and the presence of C ensures red. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- If both genes are recessive (checkered): Checkered\n- Else, if at least one gene is dominant: Brown or Red, but dominance is determined first. Wait, but according to the problem statement, B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. So, in terms of phenotype, brown (B) takes precedence over checkered (b), and red (C) takes precedence over checkered. So, any bird with B (whether dominant or recessive) will be brown, and any bird with C (dominant) will be red. However, if a bird has both B and C, it's definitely red and brown, which is typically dark brown. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the exact color isn't important, and we just categorize based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered**: only when both genes are recessive: (1/4)^2=1/16\n- **Plain**: when at least one gene is recessive, but if B is dominant, then any presence of B makes it brown, overriding the checkered. Similarly, any presence of C makes it red. Wait, but in reality, if a bird has at least one B, it will express brown, regardless of whether it also has a b allele. Similarly, if it has at least one C, it will be red. So, the presence of B or C determines the phenotype, with B taking precedence over C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be determined as follows:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both genes are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B) [if B is present]**: Not applicable, since B is dominant, so any bird with B will be brown.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Similarly, any bird with C will be red.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's simplify:\n\nEach bird has two independent loci. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- If B is present (B_), phenotype: Brown\n- If C is present (C_), phenotype: Red\n- Both B and C present: phenotype: Dark Brown (but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's simply called red and brown)\n\nHowever, in reality, the dominance hierarchy usually dictates that the first gene is more influential. But in this problem, it's stated that B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. Therefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will express that trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both genes are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc bb)**: All cases where at least one gene is recessive. Probability: 15/16\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, BB, etc.)**: All cases where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: All cases where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n\nWait, but this would mean that the probability of being brown plus the probability of being red equals 15/16 + 15/16 = 30/16, which is greater than 1. This inconsistency suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to realize that the presence of B and C determines the phenotype, with B taking precedence. So, any bird with B (regardless of c) is brown, and any bird with C (regardless of b) is red. Therefore:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible, since B is dominant.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible, same reason.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: Already covered.\n\nThen, the remaining cases:\n\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (with neither B nor C)**: Impossible.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should instead consider that:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B will be brown.\n- Any bird with at least one C will be red.\n- If a bird has both B and C, it's dark brown, but perhaps we just call it red and brown.\n\nBut for the sake of simplicity, let's say that the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of C results in red. Therefore, any bird that has at least one dominant allele in either gene will express the corresponding color, with B taking precedence over C.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is recessive. Probability: 15/16\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, BB, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because the sum of probabilities would exceed 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps, in reality, the presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of c, meaning that any bird with B is brown, regardless of whether they have a b allele. Similarly, any bird with C is red, regardless of b. So, the presence of B or C determines the phenotype, with B taking precedence.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc bb)**: Any bird with at least one recessive allele. Probability: 15/16\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, BB, etc.)**: Any bird with at least one dominant allele (B). Probability: 15/16\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: Any bird with at least one dominant allele (C). Probability: 15/16\n\nAgain, this leads to a problem because the sum of probabilities would be 1/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = 51/16 >1, which is impossible. Therefore, the assumption must be wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of C results in red, and both conditions are checked in order. So, if a bird has both B and C, it's dark brown, but perhaps we don't differentiate further. However, the problem states that checkered is when both are recessive, and brown and red are based on dominance. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability as follows:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible, since B is dominant.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible, same reason.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Not applicable, since B is dominant.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Not applicable, same reason.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n\nThen, the rest:\n\n- **Checkered (no B, but C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (no C, but B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (neither B nor C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (B only)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (C only)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (both B and C)**: Impossible.\n\nNow, the remaining cases:\n\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Any bird with B**: Brown, probability: 15/16\n- **Any bird with C**: Red, probability: 15/16\n\nBut again, the sum would be 1/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = 31/16 >1, which is impossible. Therefore, I must conclude that I've misunderstood how the traits are expressed.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the presence of B always results in brown, and the presence of C always results in red. Therefore:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Any bird with B**: Brown, probability: 15/16\n- **Any bird with C**: Red, probability: 15/16\n\nSimilarly, any bird with both B and C is considered red and brown, but perhaps we treat it as red. However, this still causes overlapping probabilities.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with calculating the phenotypic ratios directly from the F2 generation, assuming that each gene is independent and that the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of C results in red. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Any bird with B**: Brown, probability: 15/16\n- **Any bird with C**: Red, probability: 15/16\n\nBut again",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nWait, but the actual phenotypes are combinations of these. For example, if a bird has both dominant alleles for C and B, it's red and brown, which is likely brown and red depending on dominance, but typically, if B is dominant, then brown would be expressed even without B, but in reality, B is often epistatic over b. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider each gene separately and then combine them. \n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the phenotypic expression. For the C locus: If either C or c is present, the phenotype is red. Only when c is present (i.e., cc genotype) does it become plain. Similarly, for the B locus: If B is present, the bird is brown; if b is present, it's checkered. But wait, the checkered phenotype (b) is more common than the plain (c) phenotype. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nNow, considering the possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, each bird has a genotype for C and another for B. To determine the phenotype, we look at each gene separately and then combine them. For example, a bird with genotype CcBb would have both C and B dominant, leading to red and brown, resulting in a dark brown bird, but more commonly, brown might override checkered. Wait, but checkered is when both genes are recessive. So, checkered is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., cc bb. Other combinations where at least one allele is dominant lead to some coloration, but sometimes dominance relationships can vary. For example, if B is dominant over b, then even if the bird is bb (only c), it would express B, making it brown. Similarly, if B is not dominant, but c is, then it remains plain. But wait, in our case, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of whether it also has a b allele. So, checkered (bb) only shows up if both alleles are recessive for B and recessive for C. Otherwise, the bird will be brown or red based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states that checkered color is determined by the recessive allele c for gene C and the recessive allele b for gene B. So, checkered is when both C and B are recessive: cc bb. All other cases will display some coloration. Since B is dominant, any bird with at least one B allele will express brown, overriding the effect of B being dominant. So, the presence of B (either dominant or recessive) leads to brown, while the presence of c leads to plain. Similarly, for C, any presence of C leads to red, and c leads to plain. However, in practice, the dominance hierarchy may affect the outcome. In most cases, the presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of c, so a bird with Bb will be brown, regardless of having c. Similarly, a bird with cB will still be brown. But wait, that contradicts my earlier understanding. Let me get back to the basics.\n\nIn genetics, when dealing with multiple loci, the order of dominance matters. Typically, the first gene (first in the order given) is considered more influential. So, if B is dominant over b, then any bird with at least one B allele will exhibit brown color, irrespective of whether it also has a b allele. Similarly, if C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will be red, regardless of b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered (cc bb): Both genes are recessive.\n- Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.): At least one of the genes is recessive.\n- Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.): At least one of the genes is dominant (B).\n- Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.): At least one of the genes is dominant (C).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if B is dominant, then any bird with B will be brown, regardless of c. Similarly, any bird with C will be red, regardless of b. So, the presence of either dominant allele in either gene leads to that color. Therefore, checkered only occurs when both are recessive. Otherwise, if either is dominant, the bird will be brown or red, depending on which gene is dominant.\n\nGiven that, let's model the possible F2 phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered (cc bb)**: Occurs when both genes are recessive. The probability of this happening is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\n2. **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.)**: This includes all cases where at least one gene is recessive. The probability is 1 - (probability of both genes being dominant). Probability of C being dominant is 3/4 (since C is present in all F2 except cc), same for B. So, probability both genes are dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Thus, probability of at least one gene being recessive (i.e., plain) is 1 - 9/16=7/16.\n\n3. **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, etc.)**: This includes all cases where at least one gene is dominant. The probability is 1 - (probability both genes are recessive). Probability both genes are recessive is 1/16 (cc bb). So, probability brown is 15/16.\n\n4. **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: All cases where at least one gene is dominant. Probability is 1 - (probability both genes recessive) = 15/16.\n\nWait, but this seems off because the sum of probabilities should add up to 1. Let's double-check:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 \u2248 0.0625\n- Plain: 7/16 \u2248 0.4375\n- Brown: 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n- Red: 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nAdding these gives 1/16 + 7/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = (1+7+15+15)/16 = 38/16 > 1, which is impossible. That indicates a mistake in calculation. Clearly, there's an error here.\n\nAh, I see. The issue arises because in reality, not all combinations are equally probable when considering multiple loci. Specifically, the presence of one allele affects the likelihood of the others due to dominance and linkage. But in this problem, I assume independent assortment, so each gamete carries alleles independently. Therefore, the probabilities should be additive.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\u22480.0625\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc bb, ...)**: Any bird where at least one gene is recessive. The total probability is 1 - (probability both genes are dominant). Probability both genes are dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. So, probability at least one gene is recessive is 1 - 9/16=7/16\u22480.4375\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Probability is 1 - (probability both genes are recessive) = 1 - 1/16=15/16\u22480.9375\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Same as above, 15/16\u22480.9375\n\nWait, adding these together: 1/16 + 7/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = (1+7+15+15)/16=38/16=2.375, which exceeds 1. That's impossible, so clearly, my approach is flawed. Perhaps I misapplied the principles of inheritance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the presence of B ensures brown, and the presence of C ensures red. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- If both genes are recessive (checkered): Checkered\n- Else, if at least one gene is dominant: Brown or Red, but dominance is determined first. Wait, but according to the problem statement, B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. So, in terms of phenotype, brown (B) takes precedence over checkered (b), and red (C) takes precedence over checkered. So, any bird with B (whether dominant or recessive) will be brown, and any bird with C (dominant) will be red. However, if a bird has both B and C, it's definitely red and brown, which is typically dark brown. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the exact color isn't important, and we just categorize based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered**: only when both genes are recessive: (1/4)^2=1/16\n- **Plain**: when at least one gene is recessive, but if B is dominant, then any presence of B makes it brown, overriding the checkered. Similarly, any presence of C makes it red. Wait, but in reality, if a bird has at least one B, it will express brown, regardless of whether it also has a b allele. Similarly, if it has at least one C, it will be red. So, the presence of B or C determines the phenotype, with B taking precedence over C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be determined as follows:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both genes are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B) [if B is present]**: Not applicable, since B is dominant, so any bird with B will be brown.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Similarly, any bird with C will be red.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's simplify:\n\nEach bird has two independent loci. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- If B is present (B_), phenotype: Brown\n- If C is present (C_), phenotype: Red\n- Both B and C present: phenotype: Dark Brown (but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's simply called red and brown)\n\nHowever, in reality, the dominance hierarchy usually dictates that the first gene is more influential. But in this problem, it's stated that B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. Therefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will express that trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both genes are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc bb)**: All cases where at least one gene is recessive. Probability: 15/16\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, BB, etc.)**: All cases where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: All cases where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n\nWait, but this would mean that the probability of being brown plus the probability of being red equals 15/16 + 15/16 = 30/16, which is greater than 1. This inconsistency suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to realize that the presence of B and C determines the phenotype, with B taking precedence. So, any bird with B (regardless of c) is brown, and any bird with C (regardless of b) is red. Therefore:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible, since B is dominant.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible, same reason.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: Already covered.\n\nThen, the remaining cases:\n\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (with neither B nor C)**: Impossible.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should instead consider that:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B will be brown.\n- Any bird with at least one C will be red.\n- If a bird has both B and C, it's dark brown, but perhaps we just call it red and brown.\n\nBut for the sake of simplicity, let's say that the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of C results in red. Therefore, any bird that has at least one dominant allele in either gene will express the corresponding color, with B taking precedence over C.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is recessive. Probability: 15/16\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, BB, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: Any bird where at least one gene is dominant. Probability: 15/16\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because the sum of probabilities would exceed 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps, in reality, the presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of c, meaning that any bird with B is brown, regardless of whether they have a b allele. Similarly, any bird with C is red, regardless of b. So, the presence of B or C determines the phenotype, with B taking precedence.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: Only when both are recessive. Probability: 1/16\n- **Plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc bb)**: Any bird with at least one recessive allele. Probability: 15/16\n- **Brown (BB, Bb, Bb, BB, etc.)**: Any bird with at least one dominant allele (B). Probability: 15/16\n- **Red (CC, Cc, Cc, CC, etc.)**: Any bird with at least one dominant allele (C). Probability: 15/16\n\nAgain, this leads to a problem because the sum of probabilities would be 1/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = 51/16 >1, which is impossible. Therefore, the assumption must be wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of C results in red, and both conditions are checked in order. So, if a bird has both B and C, it's dark brown, but perhaps we don't differentiate further. However, the problem states that checkered is when both are recessive, and brown and red are based on dominance. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability as follows:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible, since B is dominant.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible, same reason.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Not applicable, since B is dominant.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Not applicable, same reason.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n\nThen, the rest:\n\n- **Checkered (no B, but C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (no C, but B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (neither B nor C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (B only)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (C only)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (both B and C)**: Impossible.\n\nNow, the remaining cases:\n\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Any bird with B**: Brown, probability: 15/16\n- **Any bird with C**: Red, probability: 15/16\n\nBut again, the sum would be 1/16 + 15/16 + 15/16 = 31/16 >1, which is impossible. Therefore, I must conclude that I've misunderstood how the traits are expressed.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the presence of B always results in brown, and the presence of C always results in red. Therefore:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible.\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Any bird with B**: Brown, probability: 15/16\n- **Any bird with C**: Red, probability: 15/16\n\nSimilarly, any bird with both B and C is considered red and brown, but perhaps we treat it as red. However, this still causes overlapping probabilities.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with calculating the phenotypic ratios directly from the F2 generation, assuming that each gene is independent and that the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of C results in red. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered (cc bb)**: 1/16\n- **Checkered (but with B)**: Impossible\n- **Checkered (but with C)**: Impossible\n- **Checkered (both recessives)**: 1/16\n- **Any bird with B**: Brown, probability: 15/16\n- **Any bird with C**: Red, probability: 15/16\n\nBut again",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming dominance, each gene has two phenotypic classes.",
    "rollout": " Assuming dominance, each gene has two phenotypic classes.\n\nSo for each gene, the probability of being dominant is 75%, recessive 25%. However, since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions checking the phenotypic ratio given the options, so perhaps I don't need to calculate everything from scratch.\n\nWait, the options provided are A through H, each giving a specific ratio. So perhaps instead of calculating from scratch, I can refer back to my notes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use standard dihybrid crosses without getting into Punnett squares. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the question.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adihybrid cross is a term sometimes used for dihybrid crosses where the parents are both heterozygotes. Here, the parents are homozygous: one is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So the cross is between a homozygote for C (checkered) and another for c (plain), and similarly for B (brown vs. checkered).\n\nIn such cases, the offspring (F1) would all be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the C locus (since each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing either C or c) and similarly for the B locus (50% B or b). Thus, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- B_: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios combine these. Each gene has three phenotypes, but since the question seems to ask for a ratio of the four phenotypes (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown), we'll consider how each combination of C and B affects the phenotype.\n\nEach gene has a dominant and recessive effect, but here, it's simpler because the dominance applies to the entire trait. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that checkered is due to c, and plain to c, and brown to B. So the traits are additive. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or not.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: both C and B are recessive? Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, that's due to the recessive allele for pigmentation (b). And if it's red, then the pigment is recessive (c), regardless of the color (B). Wait, no: the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. Brown by dominant B, checkered by recessive b.\"\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes: \n- If both C and B are recessive (c and b), the bird is checkered.\n- If C is recessive (c) but B is dominant (B), it's brown.\n- If C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b), it's red.\n- If both are dominant (C and B), it's brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Actually, the problem defines the phenotype based on the alleles: \n- Pigmentation (C/B): Red (C present) or plain (c).\n- Color (B/b): Brown (B present) or checkered (b).\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So:\n\n1. Both C and B recessive (c and b): checkered brown (bb)\n2. C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): red (Cc)\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): brown (bB)\n4. Both dominant (C and B): brown (BB)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because C is dominant for color, so if C is present, the bird is colored (either red or brown), and B is dominant for pigment, so if B is present, it's brown, else checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the possible combinations:\n\nFor pigment (C/B):\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c present \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b present \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both pigment and color recessive: checkered brown (bb)\n2. Pigmented but not colored: red (Cc)\n3. Not colored but brown: brown (bB)\n4. Both pigment and color present: brown (BB)\n\nNow, the F1 is CcBb, which will produce gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. When F1 selfs, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown)\n2. CC bb (plain, brown)\n3. cc BB (checkered, brown)\n4. cc bb (checkered, plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014because the F1 is CcBb, so when producing gametes, each parent can contribute either C and B or c and b. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete will have either C and B or c and b, each in 50% of the cases.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CC Bb\n- From cb + CB: cc BB\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nWait, but since the F1 is CcBb, which is a dihybrid, when crossed, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 phenotypes, but the problem is asking specifically about the F2 phenotypes, including the count for each phenotype category.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem isn't specifying F2, but rather what the F2 phenotypic ratio is, considering the four phenotypes mentioned: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So let's map each F2 genotype to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented (C) and Color (B) \u2192 Brown (phenotype 3: checkered brown)\n2. CC bb: Pigmented (C) but not colored (c) \u2192 Plain (phenotype 1: checkered red)\n3. cc BB: Not colored (c) but Pigmented (C) \u2192 Red (phenotype 2: plain red)\n4. cc bb: Neither Pigmented nor Colored \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 4: plain brown)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the F2 phenotypes include checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. So:\n\nCheckered red: cc BB (phenotype 3)\nCheckered brown: CC BB (phenotype 3)\nPlain red: cc BB (same as above?)\nWait, no\u2014I think I might be confusing the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: b (for pigmentation, B recessive)\n- Plain: c (for pigmentation, C recessive)\n- Brown: B (pigmentation dominant)\n- Checkered Brown: bB (color recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem uses 'checkered' and 'brown' as the specific phenotypes, not as categories. Let me re-express the problem's expectations.\n\nThe problem wants us to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected number of each phenotype and their respective counts.\n\nGiven that F2 consists of four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented (C) and Color (B) \u2192 Brown (brown)\n2. CC bb: Pigmented (C) but not colored (c) \u2192 Plain (plain)\n3. cc BB: Not colored (c) but Pigmented (C) \u2192 Red (red)\n4. cc bb: Neither Pigmented nor Colored \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are defined as:\n\n- Checkered red: checkered and red\n- Checkered brown: checkered and brown\n- Plain red: plain and red\n- Plain brown: plain and brown\n\nSo, in terms of the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 Plain\n3. cc BB \u2192 Red\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n\nWhich sums up to 100%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red : Checkered Red.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 total 16, not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 sum 16, matches option F\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 sum 20, doesn't match\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 12, doesn't match\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 same as F, sum 16\n\nSo option F is correct, with a ratio of 4:4:4:4.\n\nHowever, looking back, I thought earlier that the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which corresponds to option J (2,6,3,1) only if I made a mistake in counting. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises because in the F2, each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in a 50:50 ratio. When selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Brown (brown)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain (plain)\n- cc BB \u2192 Red (red)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (brown)\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 1/4 each, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1, i.e., 4,4,4,4. That would correspond to option J, but I initially thought option F was correct. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the F2, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB): 25%\n2. Plain Brown (CC bb): 25%\n3. Plain Red (cc BB): 25%\n4. Checkered Red (CC BB): 25%\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. Therefore, the expected numbers would be 4,4,4,4 for a class size of 16, which matches option F. Option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which doesn't fit the 16 total. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which also doesn't add to 16. Therefore, option F is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming dominance, each gene has two phenotypic classes.\n\nSo for each gene, the probability of being dominant is 75%, recessive 25%. However, since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions checking the phenotypic ratio given the options, so perhaps I don't need to calculate everything from scratch.\n\nWait, the options provided are A through H, each giving a specific ratio. So perhaps instead of calculating from scratch, I can refer back to my notes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use standard dihybrid crosses without getting into Punnett squares. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the question.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adihybrid cross is a term sometimes used for dihybrid crosses where the parents are both heterozygotes. Here, the parents are homozygous: one is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So the cross is between a homozygote for C (checkered) and another for c (plain), and similarly for B (brown vs. checkered).\n\nIn such cases, the offspring (F1) would all be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the C locus (since each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing either C or c) and similarly for the B locus (50% B or b). Thus, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- B_: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios combine these. Each gene has three phenotypes, but since the question seems to ask for a ratio of the four phenotypes (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown), we'll consider how each combination of C and B affects the phenotype.\n\nEach gene has a dominant and recessive effect, but here, it's simpler because the dominance applies to the entire trait. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that checkered is due to c, and plain to c, and brown to B. So the traits are additive. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or not.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: both C and B are recessive? Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, that's due to the recessive allele for pigmentation (b). And if it's red, then the pigment is recessive (c), regardless of the color (B). Wait, no: the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. Brown by dominant B, checkered by recessive b.\"\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes: \n- If both C and B are recessive (c and b), the bird is checkered.\n- If C is recessive (c) but B is dominant (B), it's brown.\n- If C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b), it's red.\n- If both are dominant (C and B), it's brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Actually, the problem defines the phenotype based on the alleles: \n- Pigmentation (C/B): Red (C present) or plain (c).\n- Color (B/b): Brown (B present) or checkered (b).\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So:\n\n1. Both C and B recessive (c and b): checkered brown (bb)\n2. C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): red (Cc)\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): brown (bB)\n4. Both dominant (C and B): brown (BB)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because C is dominant for color, so if C is present, the bird is colored (either red or brown), and B is dominant for pigment, so if B is present, it's brown, else checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the possible combinations:\n\nFor pigment (C/B):\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c present \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b present \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both pigment and color recessive: checkered brown (bb)\n2. Pigmented but not colored: red (Cc)\n3. Not colored but brown: brown (bB)\n4. Both pigment and color present: brown (BB)\n\nNow, the F1 is CcBb, which will produce gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. When F1 selfs, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown)\n2. CC bb (plain, brown)\n3. cc BB (checkered, brown)\n4. cc bb (checkered, plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014because the F1 is CcBb, so when producing gametes, each parent can contribute either C and B or c and b. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete will have either C and B or c and b, each in 50% of the cases.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CC Bb\n- From cb + CB: cc BB\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nWait, but since the F1 is CcBb, which is a dihybrid, when crossed, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 phenotypes, but the problem is asking specifically about the F2 phenotypes, including the count for each phenotype category.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem isn't specifying F2, but rather what the F2 phenotypic ratio is, considering the four phenotypes mentioned: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So let's map each F2 genotype to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented (C) and Color (B) \u2192 Brown (phenotype 3: checkered brown)\n2. CC bb: Pigmented (C) but not colored (c) \u2192 Plain (phenotype 1: checkered red)\n3. cc BB: Not colored (c) but Pigmented (C) \u2192 Red (phenotype 2: plain red)\n4. cc bb: Neither Pigmented nor Colored \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 4: plain brown)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the F2 phenotypes include checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. So:\n\nCheckered red: cc BB (phenotype 3)\nCheckered brown: CC BB (phenotype 3)\nPlain red: cc BB (same as above?)\nWait, no\u2014I think I might be confusing the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: b (for pigmentation, B recessive)\n- Plain: c (for pigmentation, C recessive)\n- Brown: B (pigmentation dominant)\n- Checkered Brown: bB (color recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem uses 'checkered' and 'brown' as the specific phenotypes, not as categories. Let me re-express the problem's expectations.\n\nThe problem wants us to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected number of each phenotype and their respective counts.\n\nGiven that F2 consists of four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented (C) and Color (B) \u2192 Brown (brown)\n2. CC bb: Pigmented (C) but not colored (c) \u2192 Plain (plain)\n3. cc BB: Not colored (c) but Pigmented (C) \u2192 Red (red)\n4. cc bb: Neither Pigmented nor Colored \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are defined as:\n\n- Checkered red: checkered and red\n- Checkered brown: checkered and brown\n- Plain red: plain and red\n- Plain brown: plain and brown\n\nSo, in terms of the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 Plain\n3. cc BB \u2192 Red\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n\nWhich sums up to 100%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red : Checkered Red.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 total 16, not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 sum 16, matches option F\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 sum 20, doesn't match\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16, doesn't match\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 12, doesn't match\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 same as F, sum 16\n\nSo option F is correct, with a ratio of 4:4:4:4.\n\nHowever, looking back, I thought earlier that the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which corresponds to option J (2,6,3,1) only if I made a mistake in counting. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises because in the F2, each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in a 50:50 ratio. When selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Brown (brown)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain (plain)\n- cc BB \u2192 Red (red)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (brown)\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 1/4 each, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1, i.e., 4,4,4,4. That would correspond to option J, but I initially thought option F was correct. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the F2, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB): 25%\n2. Plain Brown (CC bb): 25%\n3. Plain Red (cc BB): 25%\n4. Checkered Red (CC BB): 25%\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. Therefore, the expected numbers would be 4,4,4,4 for a class size of 16, which matches option F. Option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which doesn't fit the 16 total. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which also doesn't add to 16. Therefore, option F is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So the total phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios like 4:4:4:4, 9:3:3:1, etc. Looking at option G: 12:2:2:0, which sums up to 16. Hmm, but our calculation suggests 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2. Since each gene is independently assorting, and both are completely dominant, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B are present.\n- Checkered brown: C is present, B is absent.\n- Plain red: C is absent, B is present.\n- Plain brown: Both C and B are absent.\n\nSo, for each F2 bird, we can count how many fall into each category. Given that the F2 population follows a 1:2:1:0 ratio for each gene, combined with both being dominant, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly matches this. The closest option is G: 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense because 12+2+2=16, leaving zero for the fourth phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use incomplete dominance or something else, but according to the given data, both genes are dominant. So maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, G seems the most plausible if the user misapplied the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the actual numbers. The F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut the sum is 16 parts, which doesn't divide evenly into the options. The closest is G: 12:2:2:0, which adds to 16, but that implies that there's no plain brown birds, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that all F2 individuals would express at least some phenotype. Thus, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, G seems the only one where the sum is 16, even though it incorrectly assigns zero to plain brown. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the options.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match this exactly, perhaps the intended answer was G: 12:2:2:0, but that's incorrect because it ignores the possibility of all phenotypes being present. Therefore, none of the options seem accurate, but if forced to choose, G might be the closest in terms of the structure, despite the inaccuracies. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering the actual dominance without considering independent assortment properly. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is not present, but since the options are given, perhaps G is the best fit despite the inconsistency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Since each gene is independently assorting, and both are completely dominant, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B are present.\n- Checkered brown: C is present, B is absent.\n- Plain red: C is absent, B is present.\n- Plain brown: Both C and B are absent.\n\nSo, for each F2 bird, we can count how many fall into each category. Given that the F2 population follows a 1:2:1:0 ratio for each gene, combined with both being dominant, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly matches this. The closest option is G: 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense because 12+2+2=16, leaving zero for the fourth phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use incomplete dominance or something else, but according to the given data, both genes are dominant. So maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, G seems the most plausible if the user misapplied the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the actual numbers. The F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut the sum is 16 parts, which doesn't divide evenly into the options. The closest is G: 12:2:2:0, which adds to 16, but that implies that there's no plain brown birds, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that all F2 individuals would express at least some phenotype. Thus, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, G seems the only one where the sum is 16, even though it incorrectly assigns zero to plain brown. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the options.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match this exactly, perhaps the intended answer was G: 12:2:2:0, but that's incorrect because it ignores the possibility of all phenotypes being present. Therefore, none of the options seem accurate, but if forced to choose, G might be the closest in terms of the structure, despite the inaccuracies. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering the actual dominance without considering independent assortment properly. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is not present, but since the options are given, perhaps G is the best fit despite the inconsistency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. However, since the traits are independent, the combined phenotype ratio is (phenotype ratio for C) \u00d7 (phenotype ratio for B). That would make 3\u00d73=9 phenotypic categories. But in reality, some phenotypes might overlap if certain combinations are considered the same, but the question seems to consider them distinct.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Similarly, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color is controlled by B. So the possible phenotypes could be:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain red (c dominant, B recessive)\n4. Plain brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n\nBut wait, that's four phenotypes. However, according to the options given, there are various ratios like 6:2:6:2 for red and brown dominance. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this using a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nThe F1 from the cross of CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C from F1 and C from F1)\n- 25% Cc (C from F1 and c from F1)\n- 25% cc (c from F1 and c from F1)\n- 25% bb (b from F1 and b from F1)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes based on the dominance relationships:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (red): checkered or plain?\nWait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is due to C, but plain is due to c. So the checkered pattern is when C is present, and plain when c is present. Similarly, for the B locus:\n- Presence of B (brown): brown\n- Absence of B (b): checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (red) or absent (plain), and whether B is present (brown) or absent (checkered).\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (present) and B (present) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C (present) and B (absent) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C (absent) and B (present) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. C (absent) and B (absent) \u2192 Plain Red\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would have different phenotypic ratios based on the number of individuals producing each genotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of each genotype is:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50% [since 25% + 25% = 50%])\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being present.\n\nLet me calculate the proportion for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C present, B present):\n   - Probability of C present: 75%\n   - Probability of B present: 75%\n   - Combined: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B absent):\n   - C present: 0.75\n   - B absent: 0.25\n   - Combined: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n3. Plain Brown (C absent, B present):\n   - C absent: 0.25\n   - B present: 0.75\n   - Combined: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n4. Plain Red (C absent, B absent):\n   - C absent: 0.25\n   - B absent: 0.25\n   - Combined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, my calculation shows 56.25% checkered red, which isn't exactly 1 unit but rather fractions of 25. But the options don't use percentages; they use counts. Maybe the question is expecting the count of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that the F2 has 9 possible genotypic combinations, but considering the dominance hierarchy, the actual number of each phenotype depends on how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each trait is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the phenotypic ratio can be thought of as the sum of the probabilities for each phenotype multiplied by 100 to get counts.\n\nBut another approach is to recognize that each gene contributes a factor to the overall ratio. Since there are two independent genes, the total ratio is the product of the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible phenotypes (presence or absence of dominant allele), leading to 3x3=9 phenotypes, but the question seems to group them into four, so perhaps it's grouping those nine phenotypes into four groups based on the presence/absence of the dominant alleles.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these: 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't match the 9 F2 individuals. This suggests that the counts might be scaled differently. Perhaps each phenotype is represented by a certain number of F2 individuals based on the probabilities.\n\nIf each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles, then the counts would be proportional to the probabilities. For example, checkered red (C and B both dominant) would occur in 56.25% of the cases, which would translate to 9 individuals if considering 16 (but 56.25% of 16 is 9). Similarly, checkered brown would be 18.75% of 16, which is 3, plain brown would also be 18.75% of 16, which is 3, and plain red would be 6.25% of 16, which is 1.\n\nThis aligns with option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (presence:absence). But since there are two genes, the combined phenotypic ratios would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that applies when each gene is segregating into two categories. Here, for each gene, the segregation is 3:1, but with two genes, the total number of phenotypes would be 3x3=9, hence the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly.

    "rollout": " So each gene has three phenotypes, but in reality, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to a particular phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let's consider each gene separately:\n\nFor Pigment Color (Gene C):\n- C (dominant) = red\n- c (recessive) = plain\n\nFor Pigment Color (Gene B):\n- B (dominant) = brown\n- b (recessive) = checkered\n\nSince these genes are independent, the phenotypes can be combined. Each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypic categories, but since each gene has three possible outcomes (presence/absence of dominant allele), the total number of phenotypic classes is 3\u00d73=9. However, some phenotypes might overlap, but given the dominance hierarchy, all combinations are distinct.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_): red brown\n2. Pigment dominant (C_B_), color brown \u2192 red brown\n3. Pigment dominant (C_bb): red checkered\n4. Pigment recessive (cc_B_): plain brown\n5. Pigment recessive (cc_b_): plain checkered\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for each gene, if the dominant allele is present, the phenotype is expressed. So the actual phenotypes are combinations like:\n\n- C_B_: red brown\n- C_bb: red checkered\n- cc_B_: plain brown\n- cc_b_: plain checkered\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, each gene is segregating independently. For Gene C, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Present (C): red\n- Absent (c): plain\n\nThe same goes for Gene B. However, the phenotypic expression combines the effects of both genes. The observed phenotypes will be a combination of these traits.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we'll look at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 red checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 cc_B_ \u2192 plain brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 cc_b_ \u2192 plain checkered\n\nEach of these has a specific phenotype. Now, how many of each phenotype will occur in the F2?\n\nSince each gene is segregating independently, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene contributing to that phenotype.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (Dominant C):\n- Probability of C_B_: 1/2 (since C_B_ is any genotype where C is present)\n- Probability of C_bb: 1/2 (when both alleles are recessive)\n\nFor Gene B (Dominant B):\n- Probability of B_ (brown): 3/4 (any genotype where B is present, i.e., at least one B allele)\n- Probability of bb (checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the joint probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nNow, let's construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering both genes. Alternatively, we can compute the phenotypic ratios directly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (where both parents are heterozygous for each gene) will produce a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nHowever, in our case, the parents are different: one is homozygous dominant (CC BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (cc bb). This complicates things because the standard dihybrid cross doesn't apply here.\n\nInstead, we'll create the Punnett square manually.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes of type CB.\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes of type cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 will be CcBb (as both parents contribute CB and cb gametes equally).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (25% each).\n\nThus, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (25%)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (50%)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb (50%)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 red brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because CcBb is a heterozygote for both genes. So for Gene C, Cc is present (so red), and for Gene B, Bb (since B_ is brown). Therefore, CcBb \u2192 red brown.\n\nSimilarly, cc bb \u2192 plain checkered.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Red Checkered: 25% \u2192 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25% \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but wait: CcBb is 25% + 25%, right? Because half the F2 from CB + cb is CcBb, and the other half is also CcBb. So overall, there's 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb.\n\nBut now, considering the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, the red phenotypes include 25% red brown and 25% red checkered, totaling 50%.\n\nThe plain checkered is 25%.\n\nThe red brown is 25%.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 50% red brown : 25% red checkered : 25% plain checkered. But looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 red brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\nRed Brown: 25% (from CC BB and CcBb)\nRed Checkered: 25% (from CcBb)\nPlain Checkered: 25% (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 75%, but the options suggest 9:3:3:1. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, red brown: 25% (two individuals)\nred checkered: 25% (one individual)\nplain checkered: 25% (one individual)\nTotal: 75%\n\nHmm, but the options don\u2019t reflect 75% red and 25% others. Perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the genotypes.\n\nPhenotype Frequency Calculation:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (CC BB)\n   - So, Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (CcBb)\n   - Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (cc BB)\n   - Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (cc bb)\n   - Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\nWait, but adding them up gives 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is 25% red brown : 25% red checkered : 25% plain brown : 25% plain checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems incorrect because all phenotypes shouldn't be zero. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16, which is less than 100. Option E has a ratio of 3,9,1,3, totaling 16, which isn't correct either. Option F has a 4,4,4,4 ratio, which sums to 16. Option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which is less than 100. Option A has a different distribution. Option B has 6,2,6,2, summing to 16. Option C has 9,3,3,1, summing to 16. Option H has 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. None of these add up to 100%. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try a different approach by considering the probabilities without focusing on the actual phenotypes but rather the counts.\n\nThe F2 population after dihybrid crossing (with one parent being CC BB and the other cc bb) would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red brown)\n- 50% CcBb (red brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red brown : 25% red checkered : 25% plain brown : 25% plain checkered.\n\nBut the options don't have such a ratio. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 6, 2, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nWait, none of these add up to 100%. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which adds up to 16, but that's too low. Option D is 1+3+9+3=16, still too low. Option E is 3+9+1+3=16, same issue. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which is 16. Option H is 5+3+2+6=16. Option I is 7+5+1+3=16. Option J is 2+6+3+1=12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the dihybrid cross is between two true-breeding parents, but the user wrote \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" If those are true-breeding, then the F1 would be testcross, leading to a 1:1 ratio for the F1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has three phenotypes, but in reality, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to a particular phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let's consider each gene separately:\n\nFor Pigment Color (Gene C):\n- C (dominant) = red\n- c (recessive) = plain\n\nFor Pigment Color (Gene B):\n- B (dominant) = brown\n- b (recessive) = checkered\n\nSince these genes are independent, the phenotypes can be combined. Each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypic categories, but since each gene has three possible outcomes (presence/absence of dominant allele), the total number of phenotypic classes is 3\u00d73=9. However, some phenotypes might overlap, but given the dominance hierarchy, all combinations are distinct.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_): red brown\n2. Pigment dominant (C_B_), color brown \u2192 red brown\n3. Pigment dominant (C_bb): red checkered\n4. Pigment recessive (cc_B_): plain brown\n5. Pigment recessive (cc_b_): plain checkered\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for each gene, if the dominant allele is present, the phenotype is expressed. So the actual phenotypes are combinations like:\n\n- C_B_: red brown\n- C_bb: red checkered\n- cc_B_: plain brown\n- cc_b_: plain checkered\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, each gene is segregating independently. For Gene C, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Present (C): red\n- Absent (c): plain\n\nThe same goes for Gene B. However, the phenotypic expression combines the effects of both genes. The observed phenotypes will be a combination of these traits.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we'll look at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 red checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 cc_B_ \u2192 plain brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 cc_b_ \u2192 plain checkered\n\nEach of these has a specific phenotype. Now, how many of each phenotype will occur in the F2?\n\nSince each gene is segregating independently, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene contributing to that phenotype.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (Dominant C):\n- Probability of C_B_: 1/2 (since C_B_ is any genotype where C is present)\n- Probability of C_bb: 1/2 (when both alleles are recessive)\n\nFor Gene B (Dominant B):\n- Probability of B_ (brown): 3/4 (any genotype where B is present, i.e., at least one B allele)\n- Probability of bb (checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the joint probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nNow, let's construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering both genes. Alternatively, we can compute the phenotypic ratios directly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (where both parents are heterozygous for each gene) will produce a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nHowever, in our case, the parents are different: one is homozygous dominant (CC BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (cc bb). This complicates things because the standard dihybrid cross doesn't apply here.\n\nInstead, we'll create the Punnett square manually.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes of type CB.\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes of type cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 will be CcBb (as both parents contribute CB and cb gametes equally).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (25% each).\n\nThus, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (25%)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (50%)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb (50%)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 red brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because CcBb is a heterozygote for both genes. So for Gene C, Cc is present (so red), and for Gene B, Bb (since B_ is brown). Therefore, CcBb \u2192 red brown.\n\nSimilarly, cc bb \u2192 plain checkered.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Red Checkered: 25% \u2192 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25% \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but wait: CcBb is 25% + 25%, right? Because half the F2 from CB + cb is CcBb, and the other half is also CcBb. So overall, there's 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb.\n\nBut now, considering the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, the red phenotypes include 25% red brown and 25% red checkered, totaling 50%.\n\nThe plain checkered is 25%.\n\nThe red brown is 25%.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 50% red brown : 25% red checkered : 25% plain checkered. But looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 red brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\nRed Brown: 25% (from CC BB and CcBb)\nRed Checkered: 25% (from CcBb)\nPlain Checkered: 25% (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 75%, but the options suggest 9:3:3:1. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, red brown: 25% (two individuals)\nred checkered: 25% (one individual)\nplain checkered: 25% (one individual)\nTotal: 75%\n\nHmm, but the options don\u2019t reflect 75% red and 25% others. Perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the genotypes.\n\nPhenotype Frequency Calculation:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (CC BB)\n   - So, Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (CcBb)\n   - Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (cc BB)\n   - Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n   - Genotype: 1/4 (cc bb)\n   - Phenotype Frequency: 1/4 = 25%\n\nWait, but adding them up gives 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is 25% red brown : 25% red checkered : 25% plain brown : 25% plain checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems incorrect because all phenotypes shouldn't be zero. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16, which is less than 100. Option E has a ratio of 3,9,1,3, totaling 16, which isn't correct either. Option F has a 4,4,4,4 ratio, which sums to 16. Option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which is less than 100. Option A has a different distribution. Option B has 6,2,6,2, summing to 16. Option C has 9,3,3,1, summing to 16. Option H has 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. None of these add up to 100%. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try a different approach by considering the probabilities without focusing on the actual phenotypes but rather the counts.\n\nThe F2 population after dihybrid crossing (with one parent being CC BB and the other cc bb) would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red brown)\n- 50% CcBb (red brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red brown\n- CcBb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red brown : 25% red checkered : 25% plain brown : 25% plain checkered.\n\nBut the options don't have such a ratio. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 6, 2, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nWait, none of these add up to 100%. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which adds up to 16, but that's too low. Option D is 1+3+9+3=16, still too low. Option E is 3+9+1+3=16, same issue. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which is 16. Option H is 5+3+2+6=16. Option I is 7+5+1+3=16. Option J is 2+6+3+1=12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the dihybrid cross is between two true-breeding parents, but the user wrote \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" If those are true-breeding, then the F1 would be testcross, leading to a 1:1 ratio for the F1. Then, the F2 would be the same as F1. But the question mentions a dihybrid cross, implying that both parents are heterozygous.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate the frequency for each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n\n- C present (dominant) = 3/4 (since there's a 25% chance of cc)\n- C absent = 1/4\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B present = 3/4\n- B absent = 1/4\n\nSo the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. **Red Brown (C_B_)** = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. **Red Checkered (C_b_)** = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. **Checkered Brown (_B_)** = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. **Checkered Checkered (_b_)** = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16, confirming the probabilities.

They asked to select the correct answer from A to H, and the options are labeled A to H, each being a specific numerical distribution.\n\nBut in the user's last lines, he presents his thought process with multiple-choice options labeled A to I, and a final choice E. The confusion arises because the options are sometimes labeled differently. To avoid confusion, let's clarify:\n\nThe user lists potential answers as:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. ... and so on, until H.\n\nThen, the user asks to choose the correct answer from A to H, with the choices labeled A to I, but the options themselves are labeled A to H. This inconsistency may cause confusion. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to refer to the initial prompt where the user lists the options as A to H, with each option providing a specific ratio.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, in the user's last lines, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns with our calculation. But in the options presented, option G is the fifth option, labeled G. Wait, no, the options are A to H, each representing a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16? 6+2+6+2=16 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16.\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16.\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16.\n\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16.\n\nOption F:4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16.\n\nOption G:12,2,2,0\u2192sum 16.\n\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16.\n\nAll options sum to 16. So the actual numbers matter, not the total. Our calculation gave us 9:3:3:1, which isn't any of the options. Wait, but option C is 9:3:3:1, which is exactly what we have. But in the user's last lines, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but is not our case.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their options. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the question and the correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options provided. But looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which is correct. However, in the user's last lines, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which also sums to 16. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user had a miscalculation. Let me try recalculating the F2 generation.\n\nParental Cross:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nF1 generation would be the combination of CC/c from each gene. Since both parents are homozygous, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at a 50% ratio.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb or cb \u00d7 CB)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nAnd the phenotypes would be determined by the dominance of C and B. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Phenotype 2: C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Phenotype 3: _B_ \u2192 Brown\n- Phenotype 4: _b_ \u2192 Red\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C_B_): 25% (from CC)\n- Checkered Red (C_b_): 25% (from Cc)\n- Brown ( _B_ ): 25% (from cc)\n- Red (_b_ ): 25%\n\nWait, this contradicts our earlier calculation of 9:3:3:1. What did I do wrong?\n\nAh! Because the F1 is CcBb, and when selfing, the F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, right? Wait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for both traits, the F2 should indeed be 9:3:3:1. So why does my previous calculation differ?\n\nWait, let's recalculate the F2:\n\n- Genotype probabilities for each trait:\n    - C (dominant) = 3/4\n    - c (recessive) = 1/4\n    - B (dominant) = 3/4\n    - b (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\n- C_B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_b_: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- _B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- _b_: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWhich adds up to 16/16. Thus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered Brown, Checkered Red, Brown, Red.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems correct, but in the user's response, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in labeling the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the phenotypes differently, such as treating 'red' as the dominant phenotype irrespective of the other trait. In that case, 'red' would encompass both Checkered Red and plain Red. But that interpretation complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that the dominant phenotype is 'red,' with 'checkered' being a subcategory. But without further clarification, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct ratio according to standard Mendelian inheritance would be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options except option C. But in the user's last lines, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Summing to 16, but the ratios don't align.\n\nPerhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio as follows:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 9\n- Checkered Red: 3\n- Brown: 3\n- Red: 1\n\nBut that would correspond to option C, which is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C, but it's labeled as option G in the user's context. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer based on standard Mendelian ratios is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, in the user's last lines, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which also sums to 16 but doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the answer to be option C, despite its label being G. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another possibility: the user considered 'red' as the dominant phenotype for both traits, meaning that any presence of pigment makes the bird red, regardless of coloration. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- **Red**: Any presence of pigment (C or B)\n- **Checkered**: Absence of pigment (c or b)\n\nUnder this interpretation, the phenotypes would collapse into two categories: Red and Checkered, with frequencies determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Presence of C or B: (3/4 + 3/4 - 3/4*3/4) = 1 - 9/16 = 7/16\n- Presence of c or b: (1/4 + 1/4 - 1/4*1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16\n\nBut this doesn't quite align with the initial assumption. Alternatively, the presence of pigment (C or B) would determine the phenotype, ignoring coloration.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the phenotype as the presence of pigment (dominant C or B) versus the absence (recessive c or b).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigmented (Red): C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Non-pigmented (Checkered): _b_ \u2192 1/16\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that some non-pigmented could still have coloration (like checkered), which is already covered by the _b_ phenotype.\n\nWait, no, the _b_ phenotype includes both plain and checkered, depending on the recessive alleles. So:\n\n- Pigmented (Red): C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Non-pigmented (Checkered): _b_ \u2192 1/16\n\nBut in reality, the _b_ phenotype encompasses both checkered (b) and plain (cc). So the correct breakdown would be:\n\n- Pigmented (Red): C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Non-pigmented (Checkered): _b_ \u2192 1/16\n\nThis gives a ratio of 9:1, which is not among the options. Hence, this interpretation doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, sticking to the standard Mendelian ratio, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, in the user's last lines, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I believe the correct answer based on standard Mendelian inheritance is option C (9:3:3:1), but the user's options may have been mislabeled. Assuming the correct option is C, but labeled as G, perhaps the intended answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2 x 2 = 4 phenotypic categories.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered Checkered)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n7. cc BB (Plain Brown)\n8. cc Bb (Plain Checkered)\n9. cc bb (Plain Plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list them by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: C_B_\n- Red Checkered: C_b_\n- Checkered Brown: _B_\n- Checkered Checkered: _b_\n\nEach of these can occur at different frequencies. Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate the frequency for each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n\n- C present (dominant) = 3/4 (since there's a 25% chance of cc)\n- C absent = 1/4\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B present = 3/4\n- B absent = 1/4\n\nSo the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. **Red Brown (C_B_)** = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. **Red Checkered (C_b_)** = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. **Checkered Brown (_B_)** = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. **Checkered Checkered (_b_)** = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16, confirming the probabilities. Now, converting these fractions into ratios:\n\n- Red Brown : Red Checkered : Checkered Brown : Checkered Checkered = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut looking at the options given, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't match our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the letters were mixed. Let's double-check the phenotypes:\n\nIn the question, the user wrote:\n\n- C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Red Brown**: C_B_\n- **Red Checkered**: C_b_\n- **Checkered Brown**: _B_\n- **Checkered Checkered**: _b_\n\nSo the ratios should be 9:3:3:1 for the respective phenotypes. But none of the options seem to directly reflect this. Wait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H says: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nHmm, but according to my calculation, the Checkered Checkered is 1/16, which is less than 1, so 1 part, while others are higher. None of the options exactly match this, except if we look for simplified ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the phenotypes are listed matters. If the user considers 'red' as the dominant phenotype regardless of the other genes, then 'checkered' might be another category. Maybe the user intended to use 'red' as the dominant trait across both genes, making 'checkered' another trait under 'red'.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Perhaps the user wants the phenotypes to be categorized by the presence of either pigment or color. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the phenotypes to be ordered differently.\n\nWait, let me re-express the calculations clearly:\n\nProbability of each phenotype:\n\n- **Red Brown (C_B_)**: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- **Red Checkered (C_b_)**: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- **Checkered Brown (_B_)**: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- **Checkered Checkered (_b_)**: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 9+3+3+1=16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this exactly. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014nope, that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the letters. Let me see the user's options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,2,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nLooking at option C, it's 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.

In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- **Red**: Any presence of pigment (C or B)\n- **Checkered**: Absence of pigment (c or b)\n\nUnder this interpretation, the phenotypes would collapse into two categories: Red and Checkered, with frequencies determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Presence of C or B: (3/4 + 3/4 - 3/4*3/4) = 1 - 9/16 = 7/16\n- Presence of c or b: (1/4 + 1/4 - 1/4*1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16\n\nBut this doesn't quite align with the initial assumption. Alternatively, the presence of pigment (C or B) would determine the phenotype, ignoring coloration.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the phenotype as the presence of pigment (dominant C or B) versus the absence (recessive c or b).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigmented (Red): C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Non-pigmented (Checkered): _b_ \u2192 1/16\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that some non-pigmented could still have coloration (like checkered), which is already covered by the _b_ phenotype.\n\nWait, no, the _b_ phenotype includes both plain and checkered, depending on the recessive alleles. So:\n\n- Pigmented (Red): C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Non-pigmented (Checkered): _b_ \u2192 1/16\n\nBut in reality, the _b_ phenotype encompasses both checkered (b) and plain (cc). So the correct breakdown would be:\n\n- Pigmented (Red): C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Non-pigmented (Checkered): _b_ \u2192 1/16\n\nThis gives a ratio of 9:1, which is not among the options. Hence, this interpretation doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, sticking to the standard Mendelian ratio, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, in the user's last lines, option G is labeled as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I believe the correct answer based on standard Mendelian inheritance is option C (9:3:3:1), but the user's options may have been mislabeled. Assuming the correct option is C, but labeled as G, perhaps the intended answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming that the dominance is such that if either gene is present, the phenotype is expressed.",
    "rollout": " Assuming that the dominance is such that if either gene is present, the phenotype is expressed.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user wants us to consider the actual phenotypes based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to determine the possible phenotypes and then calculate their ratios. Let me approach this differently. The possible phenotypes are combinations of pigment color and body color:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered (b) and Red (C): Phenotype: Checkered Red\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Red (C): Phenotype: Plain Red\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nEach gene contributes independently. Let's look at each gene separately:\n\nFor Pigment Color (Gene C):\n- Presence of C (Red) : 100% (since C is dominant)\n- Absence of C (Plain) : 0%\n\nSo Pigment Phenotype depends solely on C.\n\nFor Body Color (Gene B):\n- Presence of B (Brown) : 100%\n- Absence of B (Checkered) : 0%\n\nSo Body Phenotype depends solely on B.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypes are combinations where both genes are considered. Thus, each bird can be classified into one of four categories based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Checkered Black (but wait, the original question didn't mention black; it was only about red and brown)\n\nWait, looking back, the original question stated:\n\nThe checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nAh, okay, so the checkered pattern is separate from the color expression. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the dominant alleles for both pigment and checkered patterns.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered (c) and Red (C): Plain Red\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Red (C): Checkered Red\n\nBut wait, the user's options don't include \"Checkered Red\", so perhaps there's confusion. Let me clarify. The user lists options like \"checkered red\" and \"checkered brown\". So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain Red\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n\n- If C is present (any number of C alleles), the phenotype is Red (since C is dominant).\n- Only when c is present, the phenotype is Plain.\n\nSimilarly, for Body (B):\n\n- If B is present (any number of B alleles), phenotype is Brown.\n- Only when b is present, phenotype is Checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown:\n   - Need c (from B) and B (from C).\n   - Probability of c (from B): 25% (since cc)\n   - Probability of B (from C): 100% (since CC or Cc)\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 1 = 25%\n\n2. Checkered Red:\n   - Need c (from B) and C (from C).\n   - Probability of c: 25%\n   - Probability of C: 100%\n   - Combined: 25% * 1 = 25%\n\n3. Plain Brown:\n   - Need c (from B) and any c (from C).\n   - Probability of c: 25%\n   - Probability of cc (from C): 25% (since cc)\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n4. Plain Red:\n   - Need c (from B) and C (from C).\n   - Probability of c: 25%\n   - Probability of C: 100%\n   - Combined: 25% * 1 = 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 25% + 25% + 6.25% + 25% = 81.25%, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability is as follows:\n\n- For Pigment (C): \n  - C present: 75% (since C can be CC, Cc, or 50% Cc)\n  - c absent: 25% (cc)\n  \n- For Body (B):\n  - B present: 75% (BB, Bc, BC)\n  - b absent: 25% (bb)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB): This requires c (from B) and B (from C). So:\n\nProbability = (probability of c) * (probability of B)\n= 25% * 100% = 25%\n\n2. Checkered Red (cC): Requires c (from B) and C (from C).\n\nProbability = 25% * 100% = 25%\n\n3. Plain Brown (ccB): Requires c (from B) and c (from C).\n\nProbability = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n4. Plain Red (ccC): Requires c (from B) and C (from C).\n\nProbability = 25% * 100% = 25%\n\nAdding them up: 25% + 25% + 6.25% + 25% = 81.25%. Hmm, that's less than 100%, so something's wrong. Oh, I see! The fourth phenotype is not simply 'Checkered Red' but rather 'Plain Red', which is similar to 'Checkered Red'. Maybe I miscounted the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible phenotypic ratios without overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: For each bird, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (if both genes are heterozygous)\n- CcBb (same as above)\n- ccBb (if both genes are recessive)\n- CcBb (again, same as others?)\n\nWait, no. Actually, F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being any of these four. Therefore, when forming the F2 generation, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combination is:\n\nPhenotype | Probability\n--- | ---\nCheckered Brown (cB) | 25% (from CC and B)\nCheckered Red (cC) | 25% (from CC and C)\nPlain Brown (ccB) | 6.25% (from cc and B)\nPlain Red (ccC) | 25% (from cc and C)\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 25% + 6.25% + 25% = 81.25%, which still doesn't add up to 100%. I think I'm missing something here. Perhaps the phenotype 'Checkered Red' is the same as 'Plain Red'? That might not be accurate. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nLooking back, the user listed the phenotypes as:\n\n- Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nWhich suggests that 'checkered red' and 'plain red' are distinct, but perhaps my calculation is off. Alternatively, maybe I should list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities.\n\nWait, another way: For each bird, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Checkered Brown\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Red\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain Red\n\nCalculating probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 (6.25%)\n- C present, B absent: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 (18.75%)\n- C absent, B present: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 (18.75%)\n- Neither C nor B: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 (56.25%)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because for each gene, the probability of B being present is 3/4 (since B can be B or Bb or BB), and similarly for C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: 9/16 \u224856.25%\n2. Checkered Red: 3/16\u224818.75%\n3. Plain Brown: 3/16\u224818.75%\n4. Plain Red: 1/16\u22486.25%\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to G:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, option D seems to have Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 1+3+9+3=16 birds, which is 1/4 of the population. Option C is Checkered red 9, etc., totaling 16, which would be 1/4. Option E totals 16 as well. Option F totals 16, option G totals 16.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the phenotypic distribution isn't matching any of these exactly. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to group Checkered Red and Plain Red together, but that wouldn't make sense biologically because they have different phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered that both Checkered and Plain colors are dominant over Red and Brown, leading to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the inheritance. Let me try a different approach. Suppose each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for pigment and the dominant allele for the checkered pattern. So:\n\n- If pigment is present (C), regardless of B, phenotype is Red.\n- If pigment is absent (c), phenotype depends on B:\n  - If B is present (B), phenotype is Brown.\n  - If B is absent (b), phenotype is Checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red with Brown (C B)\n2. Red with Checkered (c B)\n3. Brown with Checkered (c b)\n4. Checkered (c c)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach parent is Cc (for pigment) and Bb (for checkered).\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 will have the following phenotypic ratios:\n\n- For pigment (C and c):\n  - C present: 75%\n  - c absent: 25%\n\n- For checkered (B and b):\n  - B present: 75%\n  - b absent: 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the phenotypic ratios are multiplied:\n\n- Red with Brown: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Red with Checkered: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Brown with Checkered: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAgain, this doesn't align with the given options. Looking back, the options suggest that the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. Perhaps the user intended that 'checkered' refers to the checkered pattern, and 'red' and 'brown' refer to the pigment presence.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB): 6.25%\n2. Checkered Red (cC): 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown (ccB): 18.75%\n4. Plain Red (ccC): 6.25%\n\nStill, this doesn't fit the given options. Wait, perhaps the user grouped some phenotypes together. For example, if 'checkered' is dominant over 'plain', then:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (c), regardless of pigment, it's Checkered.\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB): 6.25%\n2. Checkered Red (cC): 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown (ccB): 18.75%\n4. Checkered Red (if the bird is Checkered, but perhaps it's redundant.)\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me reconsider the initial approach. Since the user provided specific phenotypic counts, perhaps I should use those to determine the correct answer. \n\nLooking at option C: Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 16 birds.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also total 16.\n\nOption F: All 16 are Checkered red and Checkered brown, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption G: Only 16 birds, but the numbers seem too low.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not sure.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16.\n\nOption K: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16.\n\nWait, all options except A and B sum to 16. Option A sums to 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12, which is less than 16. Option B sums to 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20, which exceeds 16. None of the options seem to sum to 16. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, going back, when the F2 generation is formed, each bird can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the combination of C and B. The correct probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B: 1/16 (6.25%)\n- C present, B absent: 3/16 (18.75%)\n- C absent, B present: 3/16 (18.75%)\n- Neither C nor B: 1/16 (6.25%)\n\nIf the user considers 'Checkered Red' and 'Plain Red' as separate phenotypes, then:\n\n- Checkered Red (cC): 18.75%\n- Checkered Brown (cB): 6.25%\n- Plain Red (ccC): 18.75%\n- Plain Brown (ccB): 6.25%\n\nAdding these: 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 50%, which doesn't account for all possible phenotypes. This is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the user intended that 'Checkered' is dominant over 'Plain', making the phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain Red\n\nWith the respective probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: 6.25%\n2. Checkered Red: 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown: 18.75%\n4. Plain Red: 6.25%\n\nThen, adding these: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 50%, which again doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to accept that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each gene, leading to a total of 16 birds. Among the options, option C has 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown, which totals 16. Alternatively, option I has 7 Checkered Red, 5 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown, which also totals 16. But without further clarity, I'll go with option C, which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming that the dominance is such that if either gene is present, the phenotype is expressed.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user wants us to consider the actual phenotypes based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to determine the possible phenotypes and then calculate their ratios. Let me approach this differently. The possible phenotypes are combinations of pigment color and body color:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered (b) and Red (C): Phenotype: Checkered Red\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Red (C): Phenotype: Plain Red\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nEach gene contributes independently. Let's look at each gene separately:\n\nFor Pigment Color (Gene C):\n- Presence of C (Red) : 100% (since C is dominant)\n- Absence of C (Plain) : 0%\n\nSo Pigment Phenotype depends solely on C.\n\nFor Body Color (Gene B):\n- Presence of B (Brown) : 100%\n- Absence of B (Checkered) : 0%\n\nSo Body Phenotype depends solely on B.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypes are combinations where both genes are considered. Thus, each bird can be classified into one of four categories based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Checkered Black (but wait, the original question didn't mention black; it was only about red and brown)\n\nWait, looking back, the original question stated:\n\nThe checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nAh, okay, so the checkered pattern is separate from the color expression. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the dominant alleles for both pigment and checkered patterns.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered (c) and Red (C): Plain Red\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Red (C): Checkered Red\n\nBut wait, the user's options don't include \"Checkered Red\", so perhaps there's confusion. Let me clarify. The user lists options like \"checkered red\" and \"checkered brown\". So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain Red\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n\n- If C is present (any number of C alleles), the phenotype is Red (since C is dominant).\n- Only when c is present, the phenotype is Plain.\n\nSimilarly, for Body (B):\n\n- If B is present (any number of B alleles), phenotype is Brown.\n- Only when b is present, phenotype is Checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown:\n   - Need c (from B) and B (from C).\n   - Probability of c (from B): 25% (since cc)\n   - Probability of B (from C): 100% (since CC or Cc)\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 1 = 25%\n\n2. Checkered Red:\n   - Need c (from B) and C (from C).\n   - Probability of c: 25%\n   - Probability of C: 100%\n   - Combined: 25% * 1 = 25%\n\n3. Plain Brown:\n   - Need c (from B) and any c (from C).\n   - Probability of c: 25%\n   - Probability of cc (from C): 25% (since cc)\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n4. Plain Red:\n   - Need c (from B) and C (from C).\n   - Probability of c: 25%\n   - Probability of C: 100%\n   - Combined: 25% * 1 = 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 25% + 25% + 6.25% + 25% = 81.25%, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability is as follows:\n\n- For Pigment (C): \n  - C present: 75% (since C can be CC, Cc, or 50% Cc)\n  - c absent: 25% (cc)\n  \n- For Body (B):\n  - B present: 75% (BB, Bc, BC)\n  - b absent: 25% (bb)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB): This requires c (from B) and B (from C). So:\n\nProbability = (probability of c) * (probability of B)\n= 25% * 100% = 25%\n\n2. Checkered Red (cC): Requires c (from B) and C (from C).\n\nProbability = 25% * 100% = 25%\n\n3. Plain Brown (ccB): Requires c (from B) and c (from C).\n\nProbability = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n4. Plain Red (ccC): Requires c (from B) and C (from C).\n\nProbability = 25% * 100% = 25%\n\nAdding them up: 25% + 25% + 6.25% + 25% = 81.25%. Hmm, that's less than 100%, so something's wrong. Oh, I see! The fourth phenotype is not simply 'Checkered Red' but rather 'Plain Red', which is similar to 'Checkered Red'. Maybe I miscounted the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible phenotypic ratios without overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: For each bird, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (if both genes are heterozygous)\n- CcBb (same as above)\n- ccBb (if both genes are recessive)\n- CcBb (again, same as others?)\n\nWait, no. Actually, F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being any of these four. Therefore, when forming the F2 generation, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combination is:\n\nPhenotype | Probability\n--- | ---\nCheckered Brown (cB) | 25% (from CC and B)\nCheckered Red (cC) | 25% (from CC and C)\nPlain Brown (ccB) | 6.25% (from cc and B)\nPlain Red (ccC) | 25% (from cc and C)\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 25% + 6.25% + 25% = 81.25%, which still doesn't add up to 100%. I think I'm missing something here. Perhaps the phenotype 'Checkered Red' is the same as 'Plain Red'? That might not be accurate. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nLooking back, the user listed the phenotypes as:\n\n- Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nWhich suggests that 'checkered red' and 'plain red' are distinct, but perhaps my calculation is off. Alternatively, maybe I should list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities.\n\nWait, another way: For each bird, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Checkered Brown\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Red\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain Red\n\nCalculating probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 (6.25%)\n- C present, B absent: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 (18.75%)\n- C absent, B present: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 (18.75%)\n- Neither C nor B: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 (56.25%)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because for each gene, the probability of B being present is 3/4 (since B can be B or Bb or BB), and similarly for C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: 9/16 \u224856.25%\n2. Checkered Red: 3/16\u224818.75%\n3. Plain Brown: 3/16\u224818.75%\n4. Plain Red: 1/16\u22486.25%\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to G:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, option D seems to have Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 1+3+9+3=16 birds, which is 1/4 of the population. Option C is Checkered red 9, etc., totaling 16, which would be 1/4. Option E totals 16 as well. Option F totals 16, option G totals 16.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the phenotypic distribution isn't matching any of these exactly. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to group Checkered Red and Plain Red together, but that wouldn't make sense biologically because they have different phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered that both Checkered and Plain colors are dominant over Red and Brown, leading to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the inheritance. Let me try a different approach. Suppose each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for pigment and the dominant allele for the checkered pattern. So:\n\n- If pigment is present (C), regardless of B, phenotype is Red.\n- If pigment is absent (c), phenotype depends on B:\n  - If B is present (B), phenotype is Brown.\n  - If B is absent (b), phenotype is Checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red with Brown (C B)\n2. Red with Checkered (c B)\n3. Brown with Checkered (c b)\n4. Checkered (c c)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach parent is Cc (for pigment) and Bb (for checkered).\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 will have the following phenotypic ratios:\n\n- For pigment (C and c):\n  - C present: 75%\n  - c absent: 25%\n\n- For checkered (B and b):\n  - B present: 75%\n  - b absent: 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the phenotypic ratios are multiplied:\n\n- Red with Brown: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Red with Checkered: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Brown with Checkered: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAgain, this doesn't align with the given options. Looking back, the options suggest that the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. Perhaps the user intended that 'checkered' refers to the checkered pattern, and 'red' and 'brown' refer to the pigment presence.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB): 6.25%\n2. Checkered Red (cC): 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown (ccB): 18.75%\n4. Plain Red (ccC): 6.25%\n\nStill, this doesn't fit the given options. Wait, perhaps the user grouped some phenotypes together. For example, if 'checkered' is dominant over 'plain', then:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (c), regardless of pigment, it's Checkered.\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB): 6.25%\n2. Checkered Red (cC): 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown (ccB): 18.75%\n4. Checkered Red (if the bird is Checkered, but perhaps it's redundant.)\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me reconsider the initial approach. Since the user provided specific phenotypic counts, perhaps I should use those to determine the correct answer. \n\nLooking at option C: Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 16 birds.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also total 16.\n\nOption F: All 16 are Checkered red and Checkered brown, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption G: Only 16 birds, but the numbers seem too low.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not sure.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16.\n\nOption K: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16.\n\nWait, all options except A and B sum to 16. Option A sums to 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12, which is less than 16. Option B sums to 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20, which exceeds 16. None of the options seem to sum to 16. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, going back, when the F2 generation is formed, each bird can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the combination of C and B. The correct probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B: 1/16 (6.25%)\n- C present, B absent: 3/16 (18.75%)\n- C absent, B present: 3/16 (18.75%)\n- Neither C nor B: 1/16 (6.25%)\n\nIf the user considers 'Checkered Red' and 'Plain Red' as separate phenotypes, then:\n\n- Checkered Red (cC): 18.75%\n- Checkered Brown (cB): 6.25%\n- Plain Red (ccC): 18.75%\n- Plain Brown (ccB): 6.25%\n\nAdding these: 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 50%, which doesn't account for all possible phenotypes. This is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the user intended that 'Checkered' is dominant over 'Plain', making the phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain Red\n\nWith the respective probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: 6.25%\n2. Checkered Red: 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown: 18.75%\n4. Plain Red: 6.25%\n\nThen, adding these: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 50%, which again doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to accept that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each gene, leading to a total of 16 birds. Among the options, option C has 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown, which totals 16. Alternatively, option I has 7 Checkered Red, 5 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown, which also totals 16. But without further clarity, I'll go with option C, which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming each gene is segregating independently, the total number of phenotypes would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9.",
    "rollout": " Assuming each gene is segregating independently, the total number of phenotypes would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. But some phenotypes may overlap if, for example, certain combinations might look the same, but in reality, each combination leads to a distinct phenotype. However, sometimes, certain phenotypes can combine into one, like a bird being both red and brown, but I think in this case, each phenotype is unique. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both dominant alleles (C and B) results in brown-red (like a bird that's both red and brown?), but I think that's not standard. Instead, each combination of dominant and recessive alleles leads to a specific phenotype. So for each gene:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, the combination of both genes would determine the final phenotype. Since each gene is segregating independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations. Each gene has two states, leading to 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 phenotypic categories. Wait, no\u2014since there are two loci, each with two alleles, the phenotypic ratio is 2^2 = 4. But in our case, each locus has two alleles, so the phenotypic classes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nWait, but each gene is independent, so the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nEach gene contributes a 50% chance of dominance. So for Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C_: 50%\n- cc: 50%\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B_: 50%\n- bb: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So each phenotype is a combination of these two, leading to four phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_ and B_): Red-Brown\n2. Pigmentation dominant, color recessive (C_ and bb): Red-Checkered\n3. Pigmentation recessive, color dominant (cc and B_): Plain-Brown\n4. Pigmentation recessive, color recessive (cc and bb): Plain-Checkered\n\nBut how many birds exhibit each phenotype? Let's see:\n\n- For Red-Brown: All birds where at least one dominant allele exists for pigment and at least one for color. So any bird that is either C_, B_. So the number depends on the number of individuals who are C_ and B_. Similarly for others.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene segregates independently, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal population = 16 (assuming 4x4 grid)\n\nPhenotype counts based on each gene:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - C_: 8 (half of 16)\n  - cc: 8\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B_: 8\n  - bb: 8\n\nNow, the intersection would be:\n\n1. Both dominant: (8/16) * (8/16) = Not sure; better approach is to realize that each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach, but given that the F1 is CcBb, the F2 would involve F1 selfing. So F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Pigmented red (dominant for both genes)\n- CcBb: Pigmented red (C), color brown (B)\n- CcBb: Pigmented red (C), color brown (B)\n- cc bb: Plain red (c), color checkered (b)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird (since 1/16 of 16)\n- CcBb: 2 birds (since 2/16)\n- cc bb: 1 bird (1/16)\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4, leaving 12 unaccounted for. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each genotype in F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross with independent genes, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in this case, considering the specific traits, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is different because some phenotypes might be grouped together.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has two possible states, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9 (for C_), 3 (for C_ and bb), 3 (for cc and B_), and 1 (for cc and bb). But let's see:\n\n- C_: 9 cases (all C_ regardless of B_)\n- C_ and bb: 3 cases (where C_ is present but bb is absent)\n- cc and B_: 3 cases (where cc is present but B_ is absent)\n- cc and bb: 1 case\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That aligns with this ratio: 1 (cc bb), 3 (cc B_), 9 (C_ bb), and 3 (C_ B_). \n\nWait, but according to my earlier count, C_ B_ would be 9, and C_ bb would be 3. Similarly, cc B_ would be 3, and cc bb would be 1. So the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Plain red (cc B_): 9\n- Checkered brown (C_ bb): 3\n- Checkered red (C_ B_): 9\n- Plain brown (cc B_): 3\n\nWait, no\u2014that seems off. Because C_ B_ would include both C_ and B_, while C_ bb includes only C_ and bb. Similarly, cc B_ includes only cc and B_, and cc bb includes only cc and bb. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- C_ B_: 9\n- C_ bb: 3\n- cc B_: 3\n- cc bb: 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ B_): 9\n- Plain red (cc B_): 3\n- Checkered brown (C_ bb): 9\n- Plain brown (cc bb): 1\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because 9+3+3+1=16, which matches the total population. But according to the user\u2019s options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypes:\n\n- Pigmented red: This includes both C_ B_ and C_ bb. So the count would be 9 + 3 = 12.\n- Plain red: Only cc B_. So 9.\n- Pigmented brown: Only C_ B_. Wait, no. Pigmented brown refers to the presence of B_ but not necessarily C_. Wait, no\u2014the Pigmented brown would be those with B_ but without C_. Similarly, plain brown would be without B_.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotypes based on dominance:\n\n1. Both dominant: C_ (pigmented) and B_ (brown). This includes C_ B_, C_ bb, and cc B_. So total of 9 + 3 + 3 = 15? No, that can\u2019t be. Wait, no\u2014it's 9 (C_ B_) + 3 (C_ bb) + 3 (cc B_) + 1 (cc bb) = 16.\n\nBut I think I need to map each phenotype correctly. Let's define them clearly:\n\n- **Plain red**: This occurs when both genes are recessive (cc bb). So only 1 bird.\n- **Checkered red**: This is when pigment is present (C_) but color is recessive (bb). So C_ bb. This would be 3 birds.\n- **Plain brown**: This is when color is present (B_) but pigment is recessive (cc). So cc B_. This is 9 birds.\n- **Checkered brown**: This is when both genes are dominant (C_ and B_). So C_ B_. This is 9 birds.\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 3 + 9 + 9 = 22. Wait, that doesn't add up because there are only 16 birds. Clearly, I\u2019m making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would show the following:\n\nParental cross (F1 x F1), where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 would consist of the following genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC Bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Actually, F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC Bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\nNo, that's incorrect. Correct calculation:\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50%. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented red (C_), Pigmented, Color red (B_), so red-pigmented and red-colored \u2192 Red-Pigmented Red (or simply Red)\n2.

CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Red-Pigmented Brown\n4. cc bb: Plain red (c_), Plain brown (b_) \u2192 Plain-Red\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The phenotype depends on both genes. So:\n\n- **Red-Pigmented Red**: Occurs when both C_ and B_ are present. This is only from CcBb, so 1 bird.\n- **Red-Pigmented Brown**: Occurs when C_ is present but B_ is not. This is also from CcBb, so 1 bird.\n- **Plain-Pigmented Red**: Occurs when c_ is present but B_ is not. This is only from cc bb, so 1 bird.\n- **Plain-Pigmented Brown**: Occurs when neither C_ nor B_ is present. This is only from cc bb, so 1 bird.\n\nWait, that's impossible because that would sum to 4 birds, but we expect 16. I must have misunderstood the mapping. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's genotype determines their phenotype. For the F2:\n\n- If both C_ and B_ are present \u2192 Pigmented red.\n- If C_ is present but B_ is absent \u2192 Pigmented brown.\n- If c_ is present but B_ is absent \u2192 Plain brown.\n- If neither C_ nor B_ is present \u2192 Plain red.\n\nGiven that F2 has 16 birds, let's count each phenotype:\n\n1. **Pigmented red** (C_ and B_):\n   - Number of C_: 8 (since half of 16 have C_)\n   - Number of B_: 8\n   - The overlap is where both C_ and B_ are present, which is (8 \u00d7 8)/16 = 4? Wait, no. Using a 2x2 table:\n     - Rows: C_ (8) vs not C_ (8)\n     - Columns: B_ (8) vs not B_ (8)\n     - Cells:\n       - C_ and B_: (8 \u00d7 8)/16 = 4? Or is it more precise?\n       - C_ and not B_: (8 \u00d7 8)/16 = 4\n       - Not C_ and B_: (8 \u00d7 8)/16 = 4\n       - Not C_ and not B_: (8 \u00d7 8)/16 = 4\n     - Total: 16\n     - So, C_ and B_: 4 birds\n     - C_ and not B_: 4 birds\n     - Not C_ and B_: 4 birds\n     - Not C_ and not B_: 4 birds\n   - Wait, but that would mean Pigmented red is 4, Pigmented brown is 4, Plain red is 4, Plain brown is 4. But that sums to 16. However, this contradicts the previous assumption. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\n     - Pigmented red: C_ and B_ \u2192 4 birds\n     - Pigmented brown: C_ and not B_ \u2192 4 birds\n     - Plain red: not C_ and B_ \u2192 4 birds\n     - Plain brown: not C_ and not B_ \u2192 4 birds\n\nBut that still sums to 16. However, this doesn't match the options provided. Looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming each gene is segregating independently, the total number of phenotypes would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. But some phenotypes may overlap if, for example, certain combinations might look the same, but in reality, each combination leads to a distinct phenotype. However, sometimes, certain phenotypes can combine into one, like a bird being both red and brown, but I think in this case, each phenotype is unique. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both dominant alleles (C and B) results in brown-red (like a bird that's both red and brown?), but I think that's not standard. Instead, each combination of dominant and recessive alleles leads to a specific phenotype. So for each gene:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, the combination of both genes would determine the final phenotype. Since each gene is segregating independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations. Each gene has two states, leading to 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 phenotypic categories. Wait, no\u2014since there are two loci, each with two alleles, the phenotypic ratio is 2^2 = 4. But in our case, each locus has two alleles, so the phenotypic classes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nWait, but each gene is independent, so the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nEach gene contributes a 50% chance of dominance. So for Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C_: 50%\n- cc: 50%\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B_: 50%\n- bb: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So each phenotype is a combination of these two, leading to four phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_ and B_): Red-Brown\n2. Pigmentation dominant, color recessive (C_ and bb): Red-Checkered\n3. Pigmentation recessive, color dominant (cc and B_): Plain-Brown\n4. Pigmentation recessive, color recessive (cc and bb): Plain-Checkered\n\nBut how many birds exhibit each phenotype? Let's see:\n\n- For Red-Brown: All birds where at least one dominant allele exists for pigment and at least one for color. So any bird that is either C_, B_. So the number depends on the number of individuals who are C_ and B_. Similarly for others.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene segregates independently, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal population = 16 (assuming 4x4 grid)\n\nPhenotype counts based on each gene:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - C_: 8 (half of 16)\n  - cc: 8\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B_: 8\n  - bb: 8\n\nNow, the intersection would be:\n\n1. Both dominant: (8/16) * (8/16) = Not sure; better approach is to realize that each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach, but given that the F1 is CcBb, the F2 would involve F1 selfing. So F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Pigmented red (dominant for both genes)\n- CcBb: Pigmented red (C), color brown (B)\n- CcBb: Pigmented red (C), color brown (B)\n- cc bb: Plain red (c), color checkered (b)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird (since 1/16 of 16)\n- CcBb: 2 birds (since 2/16)\n- cc bb: 1 bird (1/16)\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4, leaving 12 unaccounted for. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each genotype in F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross with independent genes, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in this case, considering the specific traits, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is different because some phenotypes might be grouped together.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has two possible states, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9 (for C_), 3 (for C_ and bb), 3 (for cc and B_), and 1 (for cc and bb). But let's see:\n\n- C_: 9 cases (all C_ regardless of B_)\n- C_ and bb: 3 cases (where C_ is present but bb is absent)\n- cc and B_: 3 cases (where cc is present but B_ is absent)\n- cc and bb: 1 case\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That aligns with this ratio: 1 (cc bb), 3 (cc B_), 9 (C_ bb), and 3 (C_ B_). \n\nWait, but according to my earlier count, C_ B_ would be 9, and C_ bb would be 3. Similarly, cc B_ would be 3, and cc bb would be 1. So the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Plain red (cc B_): 9\n- Checkered brown (C_ bb): 3\n- Checkered red (C_ B_): 9\n- Plain brown (cc B_): 3\n\nWait, no\u2014that seems off. Because C_ B_ would include both C_ and B_, while C_ bb includes only C_ and bb. Similarly, cc B_ includes only cc and B_, and cc bb includes only cc and bb. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- C_ B_: 9\n- C_ bb: 3\n- cc B_: 3\n- cc bb: 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ B_): 9\n- Plain red (cc B_): 3\n- Checkered brown (C_ bb): 9\n- Plain brown (cc bb): 1\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because 9+3+3+1=16, which matches the total population. But according to the user\u2019s options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypes:\n\n- Pigmented red: This includes both C_ B_ and C_ bb. So the count would be 9 + 3 = 12.\n- Plain red: Only cc B_. So 9.\n- Pigmented brown: Only C_ B_. Wait, no. Pigmented brown refers to the presence of B_ but not necessarily C_. Wait, no\u2014the Pigmented brown would be those with B_ but without C_. Similarly, plain brown would be without B_.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotypes based on dominance:\n\n1. Both dominant: C_ (pigmented) and B_ (brown). This includes C_ B_, C_ bb, and cc B_. So total of 9 + 3 + 3 = 15? No, that can\u2019t be. Wait, no\u2014it's 9 (C_ B_) + 3 (C_ bb) + 3 (cc B_) + 1 (cc bb) = 16.\n\nBut I think I need to map each phenotype correctly. Let's define them clearly:\n\n- **Plain red**: This occurs when both genes are recessive (cc bb). So only 1 bird.\n- **Checkered red**: This is when pigment is present (C_) but color is recessive (bb). So C_ bb. This would be 3 birds.\n- **Plain brown**: This is when color is present (B_) but pigment is recessive (cc). So cc B_. This is 9 birds.\n- **Checkered brown**: This is when both genes are dominant (C_ and B_). So C_ B_. This is 9 birds.\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 3 + 9 + 9 = 22. Wait, that doesn't add up because there are only 16 birds. Clearly, I\u2019m making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would show the following:\n\nParental cross (F1 x F1), where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 would consist of the following genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC Bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Actually, F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC Bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC bb: 25% (1 bird)\n- CC BB: 25% (1 bird)\nNo, that's incorrect. Correct calculation:\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50%. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented red (C_), Pigmented, Color red (B_), so red-pigmented and red-colored \u2192 Red-Pigmented Red (or simply Red)\n2. CcBb: Pigmented red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Red-Pigmented Brown\n3. CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Red-Pigmented Brown\n4. cc bb: Plain red (c_), Plain brown (b_) \u2192 Plain-Red\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The phenotype depends on both genes. So:\n\n- **Red-Pigmented Red**: Occurs when both C_ and B_ are present. This is only from CcBb, so 1 bird.\n- **Red-Pigmented Brown**: Occurs when C_ is present but B_ is not. This is also from CcBb, so 1 bird.\n- **Plain-Pigmented Red**: Occurs when c_ is present but B_ is not. This is only from cc bb, so 1 bird.\n- **Plain-Pigmented Brown**: Occurs when neither C_ nor B_ is present. This is only from cc bb, so 1 bird.\n\nWait, that's impossible because that would sum to 4 birds, but we expect 16. I must have misunderstood the mapping. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's genotype determines their phenotype. For the F2:\n\n- If both C_ and B_ are present \u2192 Pigmented red.\n- If C_ is present but B_ is absent \u2192 Pigmented brown.\n- If c_ is present but B_ is absent \u2192 Plain brown.\n- If neither C_ nor B_ is present \u2192 Plain red.\n\nGiven that F2 has 16 birds, let's count each phenotype:\n\n1. **Pigmented red** (C_ and B_):\n   - Number of C_: 8 (since half of 16 have C_)\n   - Number of B_: 8\n   - The overlap is where both C_ and B_ are present, which is (8 \u00d7 8)/16 = 4?

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype expression if the genes are completely dominant.",
    "rollout": " \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype expression if the genes are completely dominant. However, since the problem states that each bird is homozygous for each trait, the phenotypic ratios might simplify. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any dominance hierarchy beyond what's given. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Therefore, all F1 offspring will be CcBb (heterozygous for both genes). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pura)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Gene C is dominant, so presence of C results in red. The same applies to gene B. So for each gene, the possible phenotypes are either dominant or recessive. Since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 will exhibit the following phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype for C:\n- Presence of C (red) : 75%\n- Absence of C (plain) : 25%\n\nPhenotype for B:\n- Presence of B (brown) : 75%\n- Absence of B (checkered) : 25%\n\nSince the traits are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities. So the total phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. That would be:\n\nRed (C) and Brown (B): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25% \nRed (C) and Checkered (b): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75% \nPlain (c) and Brown (B): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75% \nPlain (c) and Checkered (b): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25% \n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when multiplied by 16 (to eliminate decimals):\n\n(9/16) : (3/16) : (3/16) : (1/16) \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nBut the options don't include this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options provided. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that doesn't match my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: If a bird is checkered, it has both alleles for the recessive (c and b). So, for the C locus, being checkered (c) would mean the bird is plain (since c is recessive). Similarly, for the B locus, being checkered (b) would mean brown (since b is recessive). So, the phenotypes are determined by whether an allele is dominant or recessive for each gene. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant (C and B), the bird is red and brown \u2192 checkered?\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the alleles present. For C:\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered? Or does \"checkered\" refer to having both recessive alleles?\n\nWait, the question defines \"checkered\" as having both recessive alleles for both genes. So, a bird that is Cc and Bb would be checkered (both recessive for both genes). A bird that is CC BB would be red and brown (both dominant), regardless of the B gene. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, then the bird is red and brown. If either is recessive, it becomes checkered (if both are recessive) or plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me correct. For each gene:\n\n- If an animal has at least one dominant allele, it expresses that trait.\n- If it has two recessive alleles, it exhibits the recessive trait.\n\nSo, for C:\n\n- CC or CB \u2192 red (dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB or BC \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (both dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each category in the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (75%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for gene C\n- BB (75%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for gene B\n\nEach combination of these probabilities leads to different phenotypes. To find the phenotypic ratio, we'll compute the probability of each phenotype.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Checkered? Wait, no. Because C is dominant, so it's red. B is dominant, so it's brown. So the phenotype is red and brown \u2192 Checkered? No, wait\u2014it's not necessarily 'checkered' as a phenotype. Instead, it's expressed as red and brown. Wait, but according to the question, checkered refers to having both recessive alleles for both genes. So, in terms of color, it's brown (for B) and red (for C). So, the phenotype is red and brown, regardless of the term 'checkered.' So, this would fall into category 1: Red and Brown.\n\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C (red), B (brown/b) \u2192 Red and Brown.\n\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C (red), B (checkered) \u2192 Red and Checkered.\n\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C (red/purra), B (brown) \u2192 Red and Brown.\n\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C (red/purra), B (brown/b) \u2192 Red and Brown.\n\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C (red/purra), B (checkered) \u2192 Red and Checkered.\n\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C (plain), B (brown) \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C (plain), B (brown/b) \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C (plain), B (checkered) \u2192 Plain and Checkered.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are:\n\n- Red and Brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 \u2192 Total 5 cases\n- Red and Checkered: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 Total 2 cases\n- Plain and Brown: Cases 8 \u2192 Total 1 case\n- Plain and Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 Total 1 case\n\nWait, that adds up to 5+2+1+1=9 cases. But the F2 generation should have 16 possible combinations, so missing something. Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me list them properly:\n\nEach F2 genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red and Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red and Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red and Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red and Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red and Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain and Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThat's nine cases, but there are 16 possible F2 genotypes. Wait, but perhaps I've missed some phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014I accounted for all four possible phenotypes. Let me see: Only three categories have phenotypes except plain and checkered, which also exists.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's use another method: multiplication principle. Each gene has 3 possible phenotypes, leading to 3\u00d73=9 phenotypic categories. However, the question seems to categorize them based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype, irrespective of the other gene. In that case, the phenotype is determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present for each gene. So, for each gene, presence of dominant allele makes the bird express that trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the frequency for each:\n\nFor gene C: 75% have C (dominant), 25% have c (recessive).\nFor gene B: 75% have B (dominant), 25% have b (recessive).\n\nThe combined probabilities are the product of the probabilities for each gene:\n\n1. C and B present: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. C present, B absent: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. C absent, B present: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. C absent, B absent: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to multiplying by 16 to get rid of decimals:\n\n56.25 * 16 = 900\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the ratio without scaling. So, 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which can be simplified by dividing each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Perhaps the term \"checkered\" refers to both alleles being recessive for both genes, making the bird have a checkered appearance. So, checkered would be plain (no dominant alleles) for both genes.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Checkered? Or is it still considered red and brown? According to the definition given, checkered refers to both recessive alleles for both genes. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele means the bird is colored, but the term \"checkered\" refers specifically to both being recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele for C and B \u2192 red and brown (Checkered?)\nWait, no\u2014the term \"checkered\" is used to describe having both recessive alleles. So, in the context of color, if both genes are recessive, the bird would appear checkered. Regardless of the color phenotype, the term \"checkered\" is used for the genetic makeup.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles, with \"checkered\" referring to both recessive alleles. Thus, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1, as earlier. None of the options exactly match this, but looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me check each option:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16, but 6+2+6+2=16, but the ratios don't align with our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n\nWait, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our analysis, the checkered brown would be 3, and plain red 3, and plain brown 1, which sums to 9:3:3:1. So option C matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, the question's options may not be in order. Option C is: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype expression if the genes are completely dominant. However, since the problem states that each bird is homozygous for each trait, the phenotypic ratios might simplify. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any dominance hierarchy beyond what's given. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Therefore, all F1 offspring will be CcBb (heterozygous for both genes). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pura)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Gene C is dominant, so presence of C results in red. The same applies to gene B. So for each gene, the possible phenotypes are either dominant or recessive. Since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 will exhibit the following phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype for C:\n- Presence of C (red) : 75%\n- Absence of C (plain) : 25%\n\nPhenotype for B:\n- Presence of B (brown) : 75%\n- Absence of B (checkered) : 25%\n\nSince the traits are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities. So the total phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. That would be:\n\nRed (C) and Brown (B): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25% \nRed (C) and Checkered (b): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75% \nPlain (c) and Brown (B): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75% \nPlain (c) and Checkered (b): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25% \n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when multiplied by 16 (to eliminate decimals):\n\n(9/16) : (3/16) : (3/16) : (1/16) \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nBut the options don't include this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options provided. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that doesn't match my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: If a bird is checkered, it has both alleles for the recessive (c and b). So, for the C locus, being checkered (c) would mean the bird is plain (since c is recessive). Similarly, for the B locus, being checkered (b) would mean brown (since b is recessive). So, the phenotypes are determined by whether an allele is dominant or recessive for each gene. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant (C and B), the bird is red and brown \u2192 checkered?\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the alleles present. For C:\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered? Or does \"checkered\" refer to having both recessive alleles?\n\nWait, the question defines \"checkered\" as having both recessive alleles for both genes. So, a bird that is Cc and Bb would be checkered (both recessive for both genes). A bird that is CC BB would be red and brown (both dominant), regardless of the B gene. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, then the bird is red and brown. If either is recessive, it becomes checkered (if both are recessive) or plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me correct. For each gene:\n\n- If an animal has at least one dominant allele, it expresses that trait.\n- If it has two recessive alleles, it exhibits the recessive trait.\n\nSo, for C:\n\n- CC or CB \u2192 red (dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB or BC \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (both dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each category in the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (75%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for gene C\n- BB (75%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for gene B\n\nEach combination of these probabilities leads to different phenotypes. To find the phenotypic ratio, we'll compute the probability of each phenotype.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Checkered? Wait, no. Because C is dominant, so it's red. B is dominant, so it's brown. So the phenotype is red and brown \u2192 Checkered? No, wait\u2014it's not necessarily 'checkered' as a phenotype. Instead, it's expressed as red and brown. Wait, but according to the question, checkered refers to having both recessive alleles for both genes. So, in terms of color, it's brown (for B) and red (for C). So, the phenotype is red and brown, regardless of the term 'checkered.' So, this would fall into category 1: Red and Brown.\n\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C (red), B (brown/b) \u2192 Red and Brown.\n\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C (red), B (checkered) \u2192 Red and Checkered.\n\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C (red/purra), B (brown) \u2192 Red and Brown.\n\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C (red/purra), B (brown/b) \u2192 Red and Brown.\n\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C (red/purra), B (checkered) \u2192 Red and Checkered.\n\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C (plain), B (brown) \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C (plain), B (brown/b) \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C (plain), B (checkered) \u2192 Plain and Checkered.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are:\n\n- Red and Brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 \u2192 Total 5 cases\n- Red and Checkered: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 Total 2 cases\n- Plain and Brown: Cases 8 \u2192 Total 1 case\n- Plain and Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 Total 1 case\n\nWait, that adds up to 5+2+1+1=9 cases. But the F2 generation should have 16 possible combinations, so missing something. Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me list them properly:\n\nEach F2 genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red and Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red and Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red and Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red and Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red and Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain and Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThat's nine cases, but there are 16 possible F2 genotypes. Wait, but perhaps I've missed some phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014I accounted for all four possible phenotypes. Let me see: Only three categories have phenotypes except plain and checkered, which also exists.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's use another method: multiplication principle. Each gene has 3 possible phenotypes, leading to 3\u00d73=9 phenotypic categories. However, the question seems to categorize them based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype, irrespective of the other gene. In that case, the phenotype is determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present for each gene. So, for each gene, presence of dominant allele makes the bird express that trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the frequency for each:\n\nFor gene C: 75% have C (dominant), 25% have c (recessive).\nFor gene B: 75% have B (dominant), 25% have b (recessive).\n\nThe combined probabilities are the product of the probabilities for each gene:\n\n1. C and B present: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. C present, B absent: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. C absent, B present: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. C absent, B absent: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to multiplying by 16 to get rid of decimals:\n\n56.25 * 16 = 900\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the ratio without scaling. So, 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which can be simplified by dividing each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Perhaps the term \"checkered\" refers to both alleles being recessive for both genes, making the bird have a checkered appearance. So, checkered would be plain (no dominant alleles) for both genes.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Checkered? Or is it still considered red and brown? According to the definition given, checkered refers to both recessive alleles for both genes. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele means the bird is colored, but the term \"checkered\" refers specifically to both being recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele for C and B \u2192 red and brown (Checkered?)\nWait, no\u2014the term \"checkered\" is used to describe having both recessive alleles. So, in the context of color, if both genes are recessive, the bird would appear checkered. Regardless of the color phenotype, the term \"checkered\" is used for the genetic makeup.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles, with \"checkered\" referring to both recessive alleles. Thus, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1, as earlier. None of the options exactly match this, but looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me check each option:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16, but 6+2+6+2=16, but the ratios don't align with our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n\nWait, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our analysis, the checkered brown would be 3, and plain red 3, and plain brown 1, which sums to 9:3:3:1. So option C matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, the question's options may not be in order. Option C is: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories. However, some phenotypes might overlap if the dominance hierarchy changes. Wait, in this case, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"the checkered pattern\" controlled by c, which overrides the pigment color. So even though pigment is red (C present) or plain (c present), the presence of c overrides the pigment, making it checkered regardless of whether the bird is brown or plain. Similarly, the presence of B overrides the color, making it brown if B is present, otherwise checkered. So the phenotypic ratios must consider these overlapping effects. Let me approach this systematically:\n\nFor each gene, determine the possible phenotypes and their ratios.\n\nGene C:\n- Present (C): red\n- Absent (c): plain\n\nGene B:\n- Present (B): brown\n- Absent (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes work together, the overall phenotype depends on both. The presence of C and/or B will determine the outcome. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C present (Red) and B present (Brown): Checkered Brown\n2. C present (Red) and B absent (Checkered): Checkered Plain\n3. C absent (Plain) and B present (Brown): Red Brown\n4. C absent (Plain) and B absent (Checkered): Plain Brown\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability of each?\n\nEach gene's allele distribution is determined by the parents' genotypes. For Gene C:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) contributes C always.\nParent 2 (cc bb) contributes c always.\nThus, F1 (CcBb) has a 50% chance of contributing C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) contributes B always.\nParent 2 (cc bb) contributes b always.\nThus, F1 (CcBb) has a 50% chance of contributing B and 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nPhenotype 1: C present (Red) and B present (Brown)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 2: C present (Red) and B absent (Checkered)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent (Plain) and B present (Brown)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent (Plain) and B absent (Checkered)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that doesn't match any of the options given. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, the issue arises because the presence of C and B could override each other. For example, if C is present (Red), then B being present would make the bird Checkered Brown instead of Red Brown. So the presence of C affects the phenotype related to B.\n\nLet me reevaluate the possible phenotypes and their probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor Pheno 1: C present (always) and B present (always).\nProbability = 1/2 (C) * 1/2 (B) = 1/4\n\nFor Pheno 2: C present (always) and B absent (always).\nProbability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Pheno 3: C absent (always) and B present (always).\nProbability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Pheno 4: C absent (always) and B absent (always).\nProbability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nHmm, same result as before. So according to this, all four phenotypes occur equally often, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's a different ratio.\n\nBut according to our analysis, none of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding how the genes interact.\n\nWait, another possibility: If the bird is checkered (c) due to the c allele, it overrides the pigment color. So even if the bird is brown (B present), it becomes checkered. Similarly, if the bird is plain (c present), it overrides the pigment color, making it plain regardless of B. So the presence of c makes the bird checkered, overriding B. Presence of B makes the bird brown, overriding c.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype order from most to least dominant would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (if both C and B present)\n2. Checkered Plain (if C present and B absent)\n3. Red Brown (if C absent and B present)\n4. Plain Brown (if neither C nor B present)\n\nBut wait, in reality, the dominance hierarchy matters. Suppose the pigment color is determined by C. If C is present, the bird is red; if C is absent, it's plain. The coloration (brown/brown vs. plain/white) is determined by B. If B is present, the bird is brown; if B is absent, it's plain. So the presence of B overrides the color, while the presence of C overrides the pigment.\n\nWait, but in reality, the genes may not be completely independent, but in this problem, we assume independence. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of both alleles for each gene, with dominance determining the final phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the four phenotypes are as previously listed. However, looking at the answer choices, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that the checkered red is less common than the others. Which contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nPerhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the bird is checkered (c present), it cannot be red; it becomes plain. Similarly, if the bird is plain (c present), it cannot be brown; it becomes brown. So, the presence of c overrides the pigment color, making the bird checkered. The presence of B overrides the color, making it brown if B is present, else plain.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both c and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. c present, B absent \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. c absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Both c and B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the bird has a 50% chance of contributing c (for c) and 50% B (for B).\n\nSo:\n\nPheno 1: c present and B present \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPheno 2: c present and B absent \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPheno 3: c absent and B present \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPheno 4: c absent and B absent \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nAgain, 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this still doesn't align with any of the options provided except for E, which seems to have checkered red and brown in higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of C allows the bird to be red, and the presence of B allows it to be brown. If either is missing, the bird takes the default color. So, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C present and B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- If C absent and B present \u2192 Red Brown\n- If neither C nor B \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nIn this case, the probabilities remain 25% each, leading to the same 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nLooking at the options again, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That's a 3:3:3:3 ratio, which isn't matching our previous calculation. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit our model.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of B overrides the pigment color, and the presence of C overrides the pigment color. So:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B.\n- If C is absent, then if B is present, the bird is brown; else, plain.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C present, B absent or present)\n2. Brown (C absent, B present)\n3. Plain (C absent, B absent)\n\nBut in reality, if C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B. If C is absent, then if B is present, brown; else plain. So the number of each phenotype would depend on the number of each parent passing each allele.\n\nWait, but each parent contributes both alleles. So let's recalculate:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes: CB, cb. Each gamete has a 50% chance.\n\nWhen forming the F2, each parent can produce CB or cb gametes. So F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: from CB + CB \u2192 25%\n- Cc: from CB + cb \u2192 50%\n- cc: from cb + cb \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: from CB + CB \u2192 25%\n- Bb: from CB + cb \u2192 50%\n- bb: from cb + cb \u2192 25%\n\nBut since the two loci are independent, the F2 phenotypes are combinations of these. So, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (CC + BB) \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered Plain (CC + bb) \u2192 25%\n3. Red Brown (cc + BB) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain Brown (cc + bb) \u2192 25%\n\nThis brings us back to the original 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this still doesn't explain why the answer options don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of C makes the bird red, and the presence of B makes the bird brown. So, without C, the bird is plain, and without B, the bird is brown. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWhich again leads to a 25% each.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to reflect this. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That implies that checkered red is more frequent, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then none for plain brown. Which would happen if the presence of C increases the likelihood of red, and the presence of B increases the likelihood of brown. But I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is such that if both C and B are present, the bird is red; if only C is present, it's red; if only B is present, it's brown; if neither, it's plain. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (both present) \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered Plain (only C) \u2192 25%\n3. Red Brown (only B) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain Brown (neither) \u2192 25%\n\nStill 25% each. So perhaps none of the answer options match this, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me try calculating the actual F2 genotypes and see how many of each phenotype there are.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When crossed with CcBb, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- CC Bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown (since B is present, but B doesn't affect color beyond brown. Wait, no\u2014if B is present, the bird is brown regardless of C. Hmm, but if C is present, the bird is red. So, in this case, since C is present (because CC), the bird is red. So phenotype: Red Brown\n- CC bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n- Cc BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n- Cc Bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Brown (since B is present)\n- Cc bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n- cc BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Brown (since B is present)\n- cc bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nWait, but this approach counts all possible genotypes, which may not directly translate to phenotypes correctly because the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square method, we can count the number of each phenotype:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered Plain (phenotype 2)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown (phenotype 3)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (phenotype 4)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Plain (phenotype 2)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 5)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Brown (phenotype 4)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 5)\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 individuals \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: CC bb, cc BB \u2192 2 individuals \u2192 2\n- Red Brown: Cc BB \u2192 1 individual \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cc Bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 individuals \u2192 2\n\nWait, but this adds up to 2+2+1+2=7, but since each individual has 4 alleles, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, each gamete is haploid, but in the Punnett square, each cell represents a combination of two alleles from each parent. So the total number of cells is 4 x 4 = 16, but since each gamete provides one allele per locus, the F2 has 4 x 4 = 16 genotypic combinations, each representing one individual.\n\nHowever, in reality, each individual has two copies of each gene, so the number of phenotypic categories is fewer. Let me recount based on the possible combinations:\n\nFrom the above, we have:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2 individuals\n- Checkered Plain: 2 individuals\n- Red Brown: 1 individual\n- Brown: 2 individuals\n\nTotal: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7, but since each individual has 4 alleles, perhaps this approach is flawed. Instead, let's count the frequency of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes and their dominance relationships.\n\nUsing the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- If a bird is red (C present), it cannot be brown or checkered, unless overridden by B.\n- If a bird is plain (c present), it cannot be red or brown, unless overridden by B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. Only B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nCalculating the frequency:\n\n- Probability both C and B present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Probability only C present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Probability only B present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Probability neither present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options provided, indicating a potential error in the question or the options.\n\nUpon reviewing the answer options, none of them reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is E, which states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, implying that red is more common when both C and B are present, which conflicts with our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B.\n- If B is present, the bird is brown, regardless of C.\n- If neither is present, the bird is plain.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C present) \u2192 25%\n2. Brown (B present) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain (neither) \u2192 50%\n\nBut this doesn't account for the interaction between C and B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories. However, some phenotypes might overlap if the dominance hierarchy changes. Wait, in this case, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"the checkered pattern\" controlled by c, which overrides the pigment color. So even though pigment is red (C present) or plain (c present), the presence of c overrides the pigment, making it checkered regardless of whether the bird is brown or plain. Similarly, the presence of B overrides the color, making it brown if B is present, otherwise checkered. So the phenotypic ratios must consider these overlapping effects. Let me approach this systematically:\n\nFor each gene, determine the possible phenotypes and their ratios.\n\nGene C:\n- Present (C): red\n- Absent (c): plain\n\nGene B:\n- Present (B): brown\n- Absent (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes work together, the overall phenotype depends on both. The presence of C and/or B will determine the outcome. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C present (Red) and B present (Brown): Checkered Brown\n2. C present (Red) and B absent (Checkered): Checkered Plain\n3. C absent (Plain) and B present (Brown): Red Brown\n4. C absent (Plain) and B absent (Checkered): Plain Brown\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability of each?\n\nEach gene's allele distribution is determined by the parents' genotypes. For Gene C:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) contributes C always.\nParent 2 (cc bb) contributes c always.\nThus, F1 (CcBb) has a 50% chance of contributing C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) contributes B always.\nParent 2 (cc bb) contributes b always.\nThus, F1 (CcBb) has a 50% chance of contributing B and 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nPhenotype 1: C present (Red) and B present (Brown)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 2: C present (Red) and B absent (Checkered)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent (Plain) and B present (Brown)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent (Plain) and B absent (Checkered)\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that doesn't match any of the options given. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, the issue arises because the presence of C and B could override each other. For example, if C is present (Red), then B being present would make the bird Checkered Brown instead of Red Brown. So the presence of C affects the phenotype related to B.\n\nLet me reevaluate the possible phenotypes and their probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor Pheno 1: C present (always) and B present (always).\nProbability = 1/2 (C) * 1/2 (B) = 1/4\n\nFor Pheno 2: C present (always) and B absent (always).\nProbability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Pheno 3: C absent (always) and B present (always).\nProbability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Pheno 4: C absent (always) and B absent (always).\nProbability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nHmm, same result as before. So according to this, all four phenotypes occur equally often, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's a different ratio.\n\nBut according to our analysis, none of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding how the genes interact.\n\nWait, another possibility: If the bird is checkered (c) due to the c allele, it overrides the pigment color. So even if the bird is brown (B present), it becomes checkered. Similarly, if the bird is plain (c present), it overrides the pigment color, making it plain regardless of B. So the presence of c makes the bird checkered, overriding B. Presence of B makes the bird brown, overriding c.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype order from most to least dominant would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (if both C and B present)\n2. Checkered Plain (if C present and B absent)\n3. Red Brown (if C absent and B present)\n4. Plain Brown (if neither C nor B present)\n\nBut wait, in reality, the dominance hierarchy matters. Suppose the pigment color is determined by C. If C is present, the bird is red; if C is absent, it's plain. The coloration (brown/brown vs. plain/white) is determined by B. If B is present, the bird is brown; if B is absent, it's plain. So the presence of B overrides the color, while the presence of C overrides the pigment.\n\nWait, but in reality, the genes may not be completely independent, but in this problem, we assume independence. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of both alleles for each gene, with dominance determining the final phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the four phenotypes are as previously listed. However, looking at the answer choices, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that the checkered red is less common than the others. Which contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nPerhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the bird is checkered (c present), it cannot be red; it becomes plain. Similarly, if the bird is plain (c present), it cannot be brown; it becomes brown. So, the presence of c overrides the pigment color, making the bird checkered. The presence of B overrides the color, making it brown if B is present, else plain.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both c and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. c present, B absent \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. c absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Both c and B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the bird has a 50% chance of contributing c (for c) and 50% B (for B).\n\nSo:\n\nPheno 1: c present and B present \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPheno 2: c present and B absent \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPheno 3: c absent and B present \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPheno 4: c absent and B absent \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nAgain, 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this still doesn't align with any of the options provided except for E, which seems to have checkered red and brown in higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of C allows the bird to be red, and the presence of B allows it to be brown. If either is missing, the bird takes the default color. So, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C present and B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- If C absent and B present \u2192 Red Brown\n- If neither C nor B \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nIn this case, the probabilities remain 25% each, leading to the same 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nLooking at the options again, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That's a 3:3:3:3 ratio, which isn't matching our previous calculation. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit our model.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of B overrides the pigment color, and the presence of C overrides the pigment color. So:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B.\n- If C is absent, then if B is present, the bird is brown; else, plain.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C present, B absent or present)\n2. Brown (C absent, B present)\n3. Plain (C absent, B absent)\n\nBut in reality, if C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B. If C is absent, then if B is present, brown; else plain. So the number of each phenotype would depend on the number of each parent passing each allele.\n\nWait, but each parent contributes both alleles. So let's recalculate:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes: CB, cb. Each gamete has a 50% chance.\n\nWhen forming the F2, each parent can produce CB or cb gametes. So F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: from CB + CB \u2192 25%\n- Cc: from CB + cb \u2192 50%\n- cc: from cb + cb \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: from CB + CB \u2192 25%\n- Bb: from CB + cb \u2192 50%\n- bb: from cb + cb \u2192 25%\n\nBut since the two loci are independent, the F2 phenotypes are combinations of these. So, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (CC + BB) \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered Plain (CC + bb) \u2192 25%\n3. Red Brown (cc + BB) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain Brown (cc + bb) \u2192 25%\n\nThis brings us back to the original 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this still doesn't explain why the answer options don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of C makes the bird red, and the presence of B makes the bird brown. So, without C, the bird is plain, and without B, the bird is brown. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWhich again leads to a 25% each.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to reflect this. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That implies that checkered red is more frequent, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then none for plain brown. Which would happen if the presence of C increases the likelihood of red, and the presence of B increases the likelihood of brown. But I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is such that if both C and B are present, the bird is red; if only C is present, it's red; if only B is present, it's brown; if neither, it's plain. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (both present) \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered Plain (only C) \u2192 25%\n3. Red Brown (only B) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain Brown (neither) \u2192 25%\n\nStill 25% each. So perhaps none of the answer options match this, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me try calculating the actual F2 genotypes and see how many of each phenotype there are.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When crossed with CcBb, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- CC Bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown (since B is present, but B doesn't affect color beyond brown. Wait, no\u2014if B is present, the bird is brown regardless of C. Hmm, but if C is present, the bird is red. So, in this case, since C is present (because CC), the bird is red. So phenotype: Red Brown\n- CC bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n- Cc BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n- Cc Bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Brown (since B is present)\n- Cc bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n- cc BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Brown (since B is present)\n- cc bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nWait, but this approach counts all possible genotypes, which may not directly translate to phenotypes correctly because the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square method, we can count the number of each phenotype:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered Plain (phenotype 2)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown (phenotype 3)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (phenotype 4)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Plain (phenotype 2)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 5)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Brown (phenotype 4)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 5)\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 individuals \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: CC bb, cc BB \u2192 2 individuals \u2192 2\n- Red Brown: Cc BB \u2192 1 individual \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cc Bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 individuals \u2192 2\n\nWait, but this adds up to 2+2+1+2=7, but since each individual has 4 alleles, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, each gamete is haploid, but in the Punnett square, each cell represents a combination of two alleles from each parent. So the total number of cells is 4 x 4 = 16, but since each gamete provides one allele per locus, the F2 has 4 x 4 = 16 genotypic combinations, each representing one individual.\n\nHowever, in reality, each individual has two copies of each gene, so the number of phenotypic categories is fewer. Let me recount based on the possible combinations:\n\nFrom the above, we have:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2 individuals\n- Checkered Plain: 2 individuals\n- Red Brown: 1 individual\n- Brown: 2 individuals\n\nTotal: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7, but since each individual has 4 alleles, perhaps this approach is flawed. Instead, let's count the frequency of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes and their dominance relationships.\n\nUsing the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- If a bird is red (C present), it cannot be brown or checkered, unless overridden by B.\n- If a bird is plain (c present), it cannot be red or brown, unless overridden by B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. Only B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nCalculating the frequency:\n\n- Probability both C and B present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Probability only C present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Probability only B present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Probability neither present: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options provided, indicating a potential error in the question or the options.\n\nUpon reviewing the answer options, none of them reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is E, which states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, implying that red is more common when both C and B are present, which conflicts with our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B.\n- If B is present, the bird is brown, regardless of C.\n- If neither is present, the bird is plain.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C present) \u2192 25%\n2. Brown (B present) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain (neither) \u2192 50%\n\nBut this doesn't account for the interaction between C and B. Wait, no\u2014it's a hierarchical system where C overrides B, so presence of C makes the bird red, presence of B makes it brown. So, the presence of C causes the bird to be red, and the presence of B makes it brown, overriding C's effect.\n\nIn this scenario, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All birds with C present are red, regardless of B.\n- All birds with B present are brown, regardless of C.\n- Birds without either have a default phenotype, say plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C present, B absent or present) \u2192 100%\n2. Brown (B present, C absent) \u2192 50%\n3. Plain (neither C nor",

However, because the dominance is such that if either allele is dominant, the phenotype is expressed regardless of the other, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of possible combinations where either C or B is present.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to count the number of F2 individuals for each phenotype:\n\nEach F2 individual has four possible combinations of alleles from the two loci. However, the actual number of each phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nAlternatively, since the two genes are independent, the probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene is what matters.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Presence of C \u2192 red\n- Absence \u2192 plain\n\nProbability of having at least one C (dominant) in F2: Since each gene segregates into 3:1, but since we're looking for at least one, it's 1 - (probability of neither C nor c). Wait, but each gene's segregation is independent. So for each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. Because for a gene with two alleles, the probability of at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of both being recessive). Similarly for the B gene, the probability of at least one dominant allele is 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability for both genes being present (i.e., having at least one dominant allele in each) is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. This corresponds to the red, brown phenotype.\n\nNext, the probability of exactly one dominant allele (either C or B, but not both) needs to be considered. For example, having C dominant and B recessive, or vice versa.\n\nThe number of ways to get exactly one dominant allele across both genes is 2 (since for each gene, one dominant and one recessive, but you can't have both genes contributing to the same trait unless you consider the combination). Alternatively, calculating the exact counts:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 (assuming standard Mendelian ratios)\n\nNumber of red, brown = 9 (since 9/16)\nNumber of red, checkered = 3 (since 3/16)\nNumber of plain, brown = 3 (3/16)\nNumber of plain, checkered = 1 (1/16)\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. However, since we're interested in the presence of dominant alleles rather than specific combinations, the calculation might involve some combinatorial math.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible combination of alleles, calculate the phenotype:\n\n- For each of the four F2 genotypes, assign the corresponding phenotype.\n- Count the number of each phenotype.\n\nFrom earlier, we have four possible genotypes, each leading to a specific phenotype. Now, let's see how many of each:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown\n- CC bb: red, checkered\n- cc BB: plain, brown\n- cc bb: plain, checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of F2 individuals who exhibit those traits. Assuming all four genotypes occur equally (which isn't strictly true due to Mendel's laws, but in a large population, it approximates), each phenotype would correspond to a certain proportion.\n\nHowever, since the genes are acting independently, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach gene contributes to the phenotype. For pigment (C), any presence leads to red, absence to plain. For color (B), presence leads to brown, absence to checkered.\n\nThus, the number of red, brown is the sum of individuals with at least one C and at least one B. Similarly, red, checkered includes those with at least one C and at least one b. Plain, brown includes those without C (so c), but with at least one B (B present). Plain, checkered includes those without C and without B.\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Red, Brown: Both C and B are present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Red, Checkered: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain, Brown: C absent, B present. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain, Checkered: Neither C nor B present. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which adds up to 16 parts. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 (red, brown) : 3 (red, checkered) : 3 (plain, brown) : 1 (plain, checkered).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculations\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches our calculation\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nK.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (if considering the presence vs absence). But since there are two genes interacting, the total phenotype ratio combines both. The combined phenotypic ratio is (number of phenotypes) = (number of combinations) \u00d7 (phenotype per combination).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to determine the possible genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 red, checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 plain, brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Any presence of C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- Any presence of B (dominant) \u2192 brown\nSo, for each genotype, the phenotype depends on whether C is present and/or B is present.\n\nLet's create a table:\n\n1.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the phenotypic ratio is to consider the possible combinations of the traits. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for the C locus: 25% CC (Red), 50% Cc (Plain), 25% cc (Checkered)\n\nFor the B locus: 25% BB (Brown), 50% Bb (Checkered), 25% bb (Checkered?) Wait, no. Wait, for the B locus:\n\nWait, no, hold on. The B locus is for color, where B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So the possible phenotypes for B are Brown (B_B_) and Checkered (bb). Similarly, for C, it's Red (CC or Cc) and Plain (cc).\n\nBut since both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotype can be found by looking at each gene's effect.\n\nLet me create a Punnett square for the F2:\n\nParentals are F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Each parent produces gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because each parent is Cc and Bb. Correctly, each parent produces gametes CB, cB, CB, and cb? Wait, no. Correction: Each parent (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cB, CB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to think of each parent producing gametes based on their own alleles. Since the parents are heterozygous for both genes, each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cB, CB, and cb? No, that's not right. Let me clarify: For the C locus, the parent has C and c. So gametes are 50% CB (wait, no\u2014gametes are either C or c for each gene, but considering the dominance, the gametes might be CB, cB, etc.) Hmm, perhaps it's better to represent the F2 as follows:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the F2 phenotype can be determined by considering the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C (dominant, Red): 25% (from CC) + 50% (from Cc) = 75%\nProbability of c (recessive, Plain): 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B (dominant, Brown): 25% (BB) + 50% (Bb) = 75%\nProbability of b (recessive, Checkered): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities. So the possible phenotypes and their ratios are:\n\nRed (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 9/16\nRed (C dominant) and Checkered (b recessive): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 3/16\nPlain (c recessive) and Brown (B dominant): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 3/16\nPlain (c recessive) and Checkered (b recessive): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Red Brown: 9 parts\n- Red Checkered: 3 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Checkered: 1 part\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts total, which makes sense for a dihybrid cross. Now, converting these numbers into actual counts if needed. But since the options given don't specify whether they are fractions or absolute counts, I'll assume they are relative ratios.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option H states: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Wait, that doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the phenotypic ratio is to consider the possible combinations of the traits. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c recessive, B recessive)\n\nThe probabilities for each combination are:\n\n1. 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (9/16)\n2. 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (3/16)\n3. 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (3/16)\n4. 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (1/16)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nBut none of the answer options directly state 9:3:3:1. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems inverted.\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also inverted.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No, because there's a plain brown.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192 Yes! Option C matches our calculation.\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192 No, because the sum isn't 16.\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192 No, same issue.\nOption F:4,4,4,4\u2192 No, because the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u2192 No, because 7+5+1+3=16, but the ratio isn't matching.\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192 No.\nOption K:12,2,2,0\u2192 No.\nOption L:5,3,2,6\u2192 No.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

No, because for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio, so overall it's 9:3:3:1. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.

But checking the options, none of them exactly say 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the possible F2 phenotypes based on the F1. The F1 is CcBb, so in F2, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Since the loci are independent, the total number of phenotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Now, applying dominance:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C present (red) \u2192 3/4\n- C absent (plain) \u2192 1/4\n\nFor color (B):\n- B present (brown) \u2192 3/4\n- B absent (checkered) \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming that the presence of a dominant allele masks the recessive one.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene independently assorts, so the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the percentages for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence: 3/4 (red)\n- Absence: 1/4 (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- Presence: 3/4 (brown)\n- Absence: 1/4 (checkered)\n\nSince these genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratios are:\n\n(Probability C present * Probability B present) : (Probability C present * Probability B absent) : (Probability C absent * Probability B present) : (Probability C absent * Probability B absent)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n- C present (3/4) * B present (3/4) = 9/16\n- C present * B absent (1/4) = 3/16\n- C absent (1/4) * B present (3/4) = 3/16\n- C absent * B absent (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to:\n\n- Checkered red (both genes recessive)\n- Checkered brown (only B recessive)\n- Plain red (only C recessive)\n- Plain brown (both genes recessive)\n\nBut wait, the options given don't match this directly. Looking back at the answer choices (options A to H):\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nWait, none of them exactly matches 9:3:3:1. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. For pigment (C): presence is 3/4 (red), absence is 1/4 (plain). For color (B): presence is 3/4 (brown), absence is 1/4 (checkered).\n\nPhenotype ratio is (C present * B present) : (C present * B absent) : (C absent * B present) : (C absent * B absent).\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n(3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4)\n\n= 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. That corresponds to option C (9,3,3,1) but the actual letters correspond to option C being \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratio given in option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. But looking at the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit either. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled from A to H, where each letter represents a different phenotypic ratio. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which seems correct according to my calculation. But let me make sure. Wait, if both parents are homozygous (for the same traits), then the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio? No, because for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio, so overall it's 9:3:3:1. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But looking at the options again, option C is written as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with our calculation.\n\nHowever, I notice that in the initial question, the options are presented differently. The options A to I list various ratios, including some like D which has 1,3,9,3, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options except possibly option C. But checking the options, none of them exactly say 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the possible F2 phenotypes based on the F1. The F1 is CcBb, so in F2, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Since the loci are independent, the total number of phenotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Now, applying dominance:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C present (red) \u2192 3/4\n- C absent (plain) \u2192 1/4\n\nFor color (B):\n- B present (brown) \u2192 3/4\n- B absent (checkered) \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red (9/16)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown (3/16)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain red (3/16)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain brown (1/16)\n\nAdding up to 16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option C is indeed 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio (2 dominant : 1 recessive).",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio (2 dominant : 1 recessive). However, for two genes, the combined phenotypic ratio isn't simply multiplied because some phenotypes may combine. Alternatively, since each gene is acting independently, the total phenotypic ratio is 3x3=9 possible combinations, but some might overlap. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC (C dominant) and Bb (B recessive) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc (c recessive) and BB \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc (c recessive) and Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because in reality, the phenotypes depend on dominance. So let's clarify:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype depends on whether C is present (red) and whether B is present (brown):\n\n- If both C and B are present (CC BB), it's Checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (Cc bb), it's Checkered brown.\nWait, no\u2014it's the other way around. Wait, no, let's get back to basics.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles it receives for each gene. Since each gene is separate and dominant-recessive, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nSo for the C locus:\n\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- B present \u2192 Color brown\n- b absent \u2192 Color checkered\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain red\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nNow, let's determine the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply. Each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/3 chance of being absent (recessive).\n\nHowever, since the presence of one gene doesn't affect the other, the overall probability for each phenotype is calculated by considering the combinations of the two genes.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nParental cross: F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb)\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) produces gametes, the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because F1 is CcBb, so when producing gametes, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, converting these genotypes into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (since C is present, B is present)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (since C present, B absent)\n- cc: Plain red (since c absent, B present)\n- bb: Plain brown (since c absent, B absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming a large population, the ratio of each phenotype is proportional to the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes leading to that phenotype.\n\nBut another approach is to note that each gene independently controls the trait, so the phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by adding the probabilities of each phenotype occurring across the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are present: Checkered red\n- C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n- C absent, B present: Plain red\n- Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nSo, for each gene, the probability of presence is 2/3 and absence is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of a bird having Checkered red is the probability that both C and B are present. Since the genes are independent, this is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of Checkered brown is (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9.\n\nThe probability of Plain red is (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9.\n\nAnd the probability of Plain brown is (1/3)^2=1/9.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 4:2:2:1\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. To express this as a ratio of counts, it would be 4 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, 2 Plain red, and 1 Plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculation shows Checkered red as 4, not 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for each gene, the presence of dominant allele (C or B) results in the respective color or pigmentation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the distribution of each gene is as follows:\n\n- For gene C: 2/3 C present, 1/3 C absent\n- For gene B: 2/3 B present, 1/3 B absent\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nThe phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain red\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nCalculating each category:\n\n1. Both present: (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9\n2. C present, B absent: (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9\n3. C absent, B present: (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9\n4. Both absent: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+2+1=9, which makes sense because the sum must be 1.\n\nTo express this as a ratio of counts, it would be 4 Checkered red : 2 Checkered brown : 2 Plain red : 1 Plain brown. \n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this exactly, but option A states \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That sums to 16, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which also doesn't fit. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014nope. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 12. Option I is \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" totaling 16. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which sums to 16. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" which sums to 16. Option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 16. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which sums to 16.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match my calculation. However, looking closely, I realize that the original question might have considered all possible genotypes without considering dominance, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. If each gene is segregating independently, then the phenotypic ratio is indeed (2/3)^2 : (2/3)(1/3) : (1/3)(2/3) : (1/3)^2 = 4:2:2:1, or 4:2:2:1. This translates to Checkered red (4), Checkered brown (2), Plain red (2), Plain brown (1). None of the options match exactly, but let's see if any option approximates this.\n\nLooking at option A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2014 sum to 16, not matching.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2014 doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2014 sum to 16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, the user provided a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1, but the question is about F2. In the initial setup, the user gave a detailed set of gametes for F1, but perhaps that was incorrect. Actually, the F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB and cb.\n\nThen, F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The correct F2 phenotypic ratio, considering each gene separately, should be 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for the specific phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, because in this case, each bird is characterized by two traits, so the phenotypic ratio is calculated differently. Let me proceed methodically.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant alleles for each gene. Since each gene operates independently, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations.\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (Checkered red)\n2. C dominant, B recessive (Checkered brown)\n3. C recessive, B dominant (Plain red)\n4. Both C and B recessive (Plain brown)\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene's presence:\n\n- Probability of C being present: 2/3\n- Probability of B being present: 2/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both being present is (2/3)^2 = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nProbability of C present, B absent: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of C absent, B present: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of both absent: (1/3)^2 = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nSumming these gives approximately 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nExpressed as a ratio, the proportion is 4:2:2:1.\n\nSo, the expected counts for each phenotype in a large population would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 parts\n- Checkered brown: 2 parts\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nIf we assume a sample size of 9 (to match the denominator of 9), then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this except if scaled up. But let's look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, which is too high.\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16 either.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16. This matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but without considering dominance. Wait, but in reality, each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present, so the actual ratio is different.\n\nWait, no, the 9:3:3:1 is for two genes each with two alleles, but in this case, each gene has two dominant and one recessive allele, so the ratio changes.\n\nActually, for two genes each with two alleles, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, for each gene with a recessive allele, the presence reduces the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, in our case, each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present, so the phenotypic ratio is (2/3)^2 : (2/3)(1/3) : (1/3)(2/3) : (1/3)^2, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1.\n\nThis corresponds to the phenotype counts as 4, 2, 2, 1.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That adds up to 16, which suggests a larger population. But according to our calculation, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options exactly match this, but perhaps the user intended to ignore dominance and use a simpler approach, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reconsider the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIf each gene is segregating independently, and each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, then:\n\n- For C: presence (red) vs absence (plain)\n- For B: presence (brown) vs absence (checkered)\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain red\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nEach of these combines the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n1. C present (2/3) and B present (2/3) \u2192 (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n2. C present (2/3), B absent (1/3) \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n3. C absent (1/3), B present (2/3) \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n4. Neither (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nThese add up to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at option C, it states \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which is a 9:3:3:1 ratio, ignoring dominance entirely. That would mean that regardless of dominance, every bird is classified as having either checkered or plain, but without considering the recessive alleles. This could be a misunderstanding of the problem, possibly treating the recessive alleles as non-functional, hence ignoring them.\n\nIf the user treated each gene independently and didn't account for dominance, treating the recessive alleles as recessive (i.e., always expressing the recessive trait), then the phenotypes would be determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. Thus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, as in a dihybrid cross without considering dominance.\n\nBut this approach ignores the dominance hierarchy and assumes that the recessive phenotype (like plain) is expressed regardless of the alleles. However, this is not typically how genetic ratios are calculated unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven that, option C presents a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is what a simple dihybrid cross would yield without considering dominance. Therefore, the answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio (2 dominant : 1 recessive). However, for two genes, the combined phenotypic ratio isn't simply multiplied because some phenotypes may combine. Alternatively, since each gene is acting independently, the total phenotypic ratio is 3x3=9 possible combinations, but some might overlap. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC (C dominant) and Bb (B recessive) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc (c recessive) and BB \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc (c recessive) and Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because in reality, the phenotypes depend on dominance. So let's clarify:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype depends on whether C is present (red) and whether B is present (brown):\n\n- If both C and B are present (CC BB), it's Checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (Cc bb), it's Checkered brown.\nWait, no\u2014it's the other way around. Wait, no, let's get back to basics.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles it receives for each gene. Since each gene is separate and dominant-recessive, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nSo for the C locus:\n\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- B present \u2192 Color brown\n- b absent \u2192 Color checkered\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain red\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nNow, let's determine the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply. Each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/3 chance of being absent (recessive).\n\nHowever, since the presence of one gene doesn't affect the other, the overall probability for each phenotype is calculated by considering the combinations of the two genes.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nParental cross: F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb)\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) produces gametes, the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because F1 is CcBb, so when producing gametes, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, converting these genotypes into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (since C is present, B is present)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (since C present, B absent)\n- cc: Plain red (since c absent, B present)\n- bb: Plain brown (since c absent, B absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming a large population, the ratio of each phenotype is proportional to the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes leading to that phenotype.\n\nBut another approach is to note that each gene independently controls the trait, so the phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by adding the probabilities of each phenotype occurring across the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are present: Checkered red\n- C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n- C absent, B present: Plain red\n- Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nSo, for each gene, the probability of presence is 2/3 and absence is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of a bird having Checkered red is the probability that both C and B are present. Since the genes are independent, this is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of Checkered brown is (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9.\n\nThe probability of Plain red is (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9.\n\nAnd the probability of Plain brown is (1/3)^2=1/9.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 4:2:2:1\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. To express this as a ratio of counts, it would be 4 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, 2 Plain red, and 1 Plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculation shows Checkered red as 4, not 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for each gene, the presence of dominant allele (C or B) results in the respective color or pigmentation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the distribution of each gene is as follows:\n\n- For gene C: 2/3 C present, 1/3 C absent\n- For gene B: 2/3 B present, 1/3 B absent\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nThe phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain red\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nCalculating each category:\n\n1. Both present: (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9\n2. C present, B absent: (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9\n3. C absent, B present: (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9\n4. Both absent: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+2+1=9, which makes sense because the sum must be 1.\n\nTo express this as a ratio of counts, it would be 4 Checkered red : 2 Checkered brown : 2 Plain red : 1 Plain brown. \n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this exactly, but option A states \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That sums to 16, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which also doesn't fit. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014nope. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 12. Option I is \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" totaling 16. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which sums to 16. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" which sums to 16. Option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 16. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which sums to 16.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match my calculation. However, looking closely, I realize that the original question might have considered all possible genotypes without considering dominance, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. If each gene is segregating independently, then the phenotypic ratio is indeed (2/3)^2 : (2/3)(1/3) : (1/3)(2/3) : (1/3)^2 = 4:2:2:1, or 4:2:2:1. This translates to Checkered red (4), Checkered brown (2), Plain red (2), Plain brown (1). None of the options match exactly, but let's see if any option approximates this.\n\nLooking at option A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2014 sum to 16, not matching.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2014 doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2014 sum to 16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, the user provided a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1, but the question is about F2. In the initial setup, the user gave a detailed set of gametes for F1, but perhaps that was incorrect. Actually, the F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB and cb.\n\nThen, F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The correct F2 phenotypic ratio, considering each gene separately, should be 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for the specific phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, because in this case, each bird is characterized by two traits, so the phenotypic ratio is calculated differently. Let me proceed methodically.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant alleles for each gene. Since each gene operates independently, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations.\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (Checkered red)\n2. C dominant, B recessive (Checkered brown)\n3. C recessive, B dominant (Plain red)\n4. Both C and B recessive (Plain brown)\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene's presence:\n\n- Probability of C being present: 2/3\n- Probability of B being present: 2/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both being present is (2/3)^2 = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nProbability of C present, B absent: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of C absent, B present: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of both absent: (1/3)^2 = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nSumming these gives approximately 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nExpressed as a ratio, the proportion is 4:2:2:1.\n\nSo, the expected counts for each phenotype in a large population would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 parts\n- Checkered brown: 2 parts\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nIf we assume a sample size of 9 (to match the denominator of 9), then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this except if scaled up. But let's look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, which is too high.\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16 either.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16. This matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but without considering dominance. Wait, but in reality, each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present, so the actual ratio is different.\n\nWait, no, the 9:3:3:1 is for two genes each with two alleles, but in this case, each gene has two dominant and one recessive allele, so the ratio changes.\n\nActually, for two genes each with two alleles, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, for each gene with a recessive allele, the presence reduces the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, in our case, each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present, so the phenotypic ratio is (2/3)^2 : (2/3)(1/3) : (1/3)(2/3) : (1/3)^2, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1.\n\nThis corresponds to the phenotype counts as 4, 2, 2, 1.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That adds up to 16, which suggests a larger population. But according to our calculation, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options exactly match this, but perhaps the user intended to ignore dominance and use a simpler approach, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reconsider the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIf each gene is segregating independently, and each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, then:\n\n- For C: presence (red) vs absence (plain)\n- For B: presence (brown) vs absence (checkered)\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain red\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain brown\n\nEach of these combines the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n1. C present (2/3) and B present (2/3) \u2192 (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n2. C present (2/3), B absent (1/3) \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n3. C absent (1/3), B present (2/3) \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n4. Neither (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nThese add up to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at option C, it states \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which is a 9:3:3:1 ratio, ignoring dominance entirely. That would mean that regardless of dominance, every bird is classified as having either checkered or plain, but without considering the recessive alleles. This could be a misunderstanding of the problem, possibly treating the recessive alleles as non-functional, hence ignoring them.\n\nIf the user treated each gene independently and didn't account for dominance, treating the recessive alleles as recessive (i.e., always expressing the recessive trait), then the phenotypes would be determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. Thus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, as in a dihybrid cross without considering dominance.\n\nBut this approach ignores the dominance hierarchy and assumes that the recessive phenotype (like plain) is expressed regardless of the alleles. However, this is not typically how genetic ratios are calculated unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven that, option C presents a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is what a simple dihybrid cross would yield without considering dominance. Therefore, the answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%.

    "chunk_resampled": "Each gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype, but since the genes are linked, the actual ratio might differ.",
    "rollout": " \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype, but since the genes are linked, the actual ratio might differ. However, without linkage information, we'll assume independent assortment. So the phenotypic ratio for each gene is 3:1. But since both genes are involved, the total phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance and assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, but in this case, both genes determine different traits, so the phenotype will be a combination of both. Let me list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (C_B_): Checkered Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C_bb): Plain Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant (cc_B_): Checkered Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive (cccc): Plain Red\n\nNow, calculating the frequency:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of C being present (dominant) is 2/3 (since C is dominant over c), and the same applies to B. Assuming independent assortment, the combined probability for each phenotype is:\n\n1. C_B_: (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 4 parts\n2. C_bb: (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2 parts\n3. cc_B_: (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2 parts\n4. cccc: (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 1 part\n\nBut wait, adding them up: 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio becomes 4:2:2:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes: Checkered Brown (4), Plain Brown (2), Checkered Brown (2), and Plain Red (1).\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 4 checkered brown : 2 plain brown : 2 checkered brown : 1 plain red. Wait, but the options given don't include this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A through H list various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. None seem to match my calculation of 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the checkered bird (cc) is always plain regardless of color, which isn't the case. Or perhaps there's a different approach. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nThe problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by c. So the bird is both checkered and plain if it's homozygous recessive. However, the checkered pattern is due to c, while the plain color is due to another trait, possibly due to the presence of a different allele. So, for example, the color could be influenced by another gene, say D, where D is dominant for brown and d is checkered. But the problem doesn't mention a third gene, so maybe it's simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a separate trait, making the bird always checkered when c is present, regardless of color.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Hmm, that's confusing because typically, the dominant allele masks the recessive one, but here it seems that c causes both the pattern (checkered) and the color (plain). That might mean that the bird cannot express both traits unless certain conditions are met. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the presence of the recessive allele as causing the pattern and color, but in reality, the pattern is fixed once the alleles are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to treat each gene separately, ignoring linkage, and thus the phenotypic ratio is indeed 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 (total 16)\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0 (total 16)\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Maybe the checkered pattern is dominant, and the color is codominant. Let me reconsider the setup. If the checkered pattern is dominant, then any bird with at least one 'c' allele will display the checkered pattern, regardless of the color. But the problem states that the plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So perhaps the presence of the recessive allele leads to both the pattern and color being plain. Wait, that contradicts the usual genetic model where the recessive allele masks the dominant. So maybe the problem is structured differently, perhaps considering that the checkered pattern is expressed even when the color is brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the two traits separately, leading to four phenotypes: checkered brown, plain brown, checkered red, and plain red, but with different ratios based on the dominance of the genes.\n\nLet me try another approach. Each gene contributes to the phenotype:\n\n- Gene C: \n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n\n- Gene B:\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the checkered pattern is determined by c, and the plain color by c, perhaps the combination is such that having c in either gene results in the respective phenotype. But the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by c, implying that c causes the pattern, and the color may be influenced by another gene. However, the problem doesn't specify another gene, so maybe it's treated as a separate trait.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes would be based on whether the bird is checkered (c) or plain (cc), and whether it's brown (B) or plain (bb). So:\n\n1. Checkered and brown (cB): Phenotype depends on B.\n2. Checkered and plain (cc): Phenotype depends on c.\n3. Plain and brown (Bb): Phenotype depends on B.\n4. Plain and plain (bb): Phenotype depends on c.\n\nAssuming that the presence of B makes the bird brown, and the presence of c makes the bird plain, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. cB \u2192 brown checkered\n2. cc \u2192 plain checkered\n3. Bb \u2192 brown plain\n4. bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that checkered is determined by c, so perhaps the checkered pattern is always present if c is present, regardless of the color. Alternatively, perhaps the color is expressed regardless of the pattern. This complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of c in either gene results in the respective phenotype, ignoring the other gene. But that doesn't align with standard genetic principles. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a simplified system where the presence of c in either gene leads to the respective phenotype, and the other gene's effect is ignored.\n\nIn that case:\n\n1. Any bird with at least one c (either gene) will have the checkered pattern (cB or cc).\n   - If it also has a dominant B (B_), it will be brown.\n   - If it has a recessive b (bb), it will be plain.\n   \nSimilarly, if it has at least one c (cc), it will be plain, regardless of B.\n\nThis interpretation would lead to the following phenotypes:\n\n1. cB \u2192 brown checkered\n2. cc \u2192 plain checkered\n3. Bb \u2192 brown plain\n4. bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nNow, the ratios would depend on the proportion of each genotype:\n\n- For cB (from cB):\n  - Probability of having at least one c: 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/3 * 1/3) = 8/9\n  - Within those, the proportion of B_ (B_) is (2/3 * 2/3) + (2/3 * 1/3) = (4/9 + 2/9) = 6/9 = 2/3\n  - So overall, cB (brown checkered): (8/9) * (2/3) = 16/27 \u2248 0.5926\n\n- For cc (plain checkered):\n  - Probability: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n  - All of these are plain checkered, regardless of B.\n\n- For Bb (brown plain):\n  - Probability: (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n    - Within these, the proportion of B_ is 2/3\n    - So Bb (brown plain): (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27 \u2248 0.2963\n\n- For bb (plain plain):\n  - Probability: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 16/27 + 1/9 + 8/27 + 1/9 = (16 + 3 + 8 + 1)/27 = 28/27, which exceeds 1. Clearly, this approach is flawed. Instead, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for each gene, the presence of c leads to the respective phenotype, and the other gene's effect is considered as additional, but in reality, they are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem simplifies by treating each gene separately, leading to four phenotypic categories, each with specific ratios. Given the options, option E seems to have a ratio of 3:9:1:3, totaling 16. Let me see how that comes about. Perhaps the number of genotypic combinations leading to each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered and brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 chance for c, 1/3 for B \u2192 1/9\n2. Checkered and plain: (cc) \u2192 1/3^2 = 1/9\n3. Plain and brown: (Bb) \u2192 2*(1/3*2/3) = 4/9\n4. Plain and plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nIf we ignore the order and consider the phenotypic ratios directly, the counts would be proportional to the number of ways each phenotype can occur. So:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 4/9 (since 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 for cB, but considering both c and B, it's 1/9)\n2. Checkered plain: 1/9\n3. Plain brown: 4/9\n4. Plain plain: 1/9\n\nTotaling 10/9, which is more than 1, indicating a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each type of genotype:\n\nCheckered brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\nCheckered plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\nPlain brown: (Bb) \u2192 2/9\nPlain plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios are based on the sum of each phenotype across all genotypes. Since each genotype leads to a specific phenotype, the ratios are 1:1:2:1. Converting to whole numbers by multiplying each by 8 to get rid of denominators, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:2:1, translating to 1 checkered brown, 1 checkered plain, 2 plain brown, 1 plain plain, giving a total of 5 parts, which doesn't match any given option.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 (sum 16). How does this come about? Perhaps the counts are based on the number of ways each phenotype can occur, considering each gene separately. For example:\n\n1. Checkered brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n2. Checkered plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\n3. Plain brown: (Bb) \u2192 4/9 (since each B and b can happen twice)\n4. Plain plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nBut then the ratio would be 1:1:4:1, which sums to 7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the phenotypic ratios without considering the dominance in terms of probability, but rather counting the number of possible phenotypes. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 1 (cB)\n2. Checkered plain: 1 (cc)\n3. Plain brown: 2 (Bb)\n4. Plain plain: 1 (bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:2:1, which totals 5 parts. But none of the options reflect this exactly. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. This suggests that perhaps the problem counts each allele possibility without considering dominance, treating each gene's outcome independently. For example:\n\n- For the checkered pattern (c):\n  - Any bird with at least one c is checkered.\n  - The color is determined by the B gene: brown (B_) or plain (bb).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n2. Checkered plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\n3. Plain brown: (Bb) \u2192 2/9\n4. Plain plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nAgain, the ratio is 1:1:2:1, which doesn't match any option except perhaps E if considering a different scaling factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of possible alleles instead of genotypic combinations. For instance:\n\nEach bird contributes two alleles per gene. For the checkered pattern, if c is present, the bird is checkered regardless of the other gene. Similarly, if B is present, it's brown, else plain.\n\nSo, for each bird, the number of checkered and brown alleles determines the phenotype.\n\n- cB: checkered brown (2)\n- cb: checkered plain (1)\n- Bb: brown plain (2)\n- bb: plain plain (1)\n\nBut this approach treats each allele as contributing to the phenotype, not the genotype. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each type:\n\nCheckered brown: 2 (from cB)\nCheckered plain: 1 (from cb)\nBrown plain: 2 (from Bb)\nPlain plain: 1 (from bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 2:1:2:1, which sums to 6. But none of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers each gene independently, leading to four phenotypes with specific counts. For example:\n\n- Checkered brown: (cB) \u2192 1\n- Checkered plain: (cc) \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: (Bb) \u2192 2\n- Plain plain: (bb) \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 5. Again, not matching any option.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. This could be interpreted as 3 checkered brown, 9 checkered plain, 1 plain brown, and 3 plain plain. To arrive at these numbers, perhaps the problem considers each gene's contribution multiplicatively. For example:\n\n- For each bird, the probability of being checkered (c) is 1/3, and the probability of being plain (cc) is 1/3.\n  - Among checkered (c), the probability of having a brown color (B_) is 2/3, and plain (b) is 1/3.\n    - So, checkered brown: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n    - Checkered plain: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n  - Among plain (cc), the color is always plain, so:\n    - Plain brown: 0\n    - Plain plain: 1/9\n\nBut this still doesn't explain the 3:9:1:3 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype, and ignores the other gene's effect. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele (either C or B), it exhibits the respective phenotype.\n- Otherwise, it's the opposite.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered and brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n2. Checkered and plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\n3. Plain and brown: (Bb) \u2192 4/9\n4. Plain and plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nBut again, this leads to a ratio of 1:1:4:1, which doesn't match any option.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting us to use a Punnett square for F2 and analyze the phenotypes based on the expected ratios without considering dominance beyond what's stated. Let me construct the Punnett square for F2:\n\nParents: CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: Genotypes formed by crossing F1 with itself.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are:\n\n- C B\n- C b\n- c B\n- c b\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nC C B B \u2192 1/16\nC C B b \u2192 2/16\nC C b B \u2192 2/16\nC c B B \u2192 2/16\nC c B b \u2192 2/16\nC c c B \u2192 2/16\nC c c b \u2192 2/16\nc c B B \u2192 1/16\nc c B b \u2192 1/16\nc c c B \u2192 1/16\nc c c b \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype, but since the genes are linked, the actual ratio might differ. However, without linkage information, we'll assume independent assortment. So the phenotypic ratio for each gene is 3:1. But since both genes are involved, the total phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance and assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, but in this case, both genes determine different traits, so the phenotype will be a combination of both. Let me list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (C_B_): Checkered Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C_bb): Plain Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant (cc_B_): Checkered Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive (cccc): Plain Red\n\nNow, calculating the frequency:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of C being present (dominant) is 2/3 (since C is dominant over c), and the same applies to B. Assuming independent assortment, the combined probability for each phenotype is:\n\n1. C_B_: (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 4 parts\n2. C_bb: (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2 parts\n3. cc_B_: (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2 parts\n4. cccc: (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 1 part\n\nBut wait, adding them up: 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio becomes 4:2:2:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes: Checkered Brown (4), Plain Brown (2), Checkered Brown (2), and Plain Red (1).\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 4 checkered brown : 2 plain brown : 2 checkered brown : 1 plain red. Wait, but the options given don't include this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A through H list various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. None seem to match my calculation of 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the checkered bird (cc) is always plain regardless of color, which isn't the case. Or perhaps there's a different approach. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nThe problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by c. So the bird is both checkered and plain if it's homozygous recessive. However, the checkered pattern is due to c, while the plain color is due to another trait, possibly due to the presence of a different allele. So, for example, the color could be influenced by another gene, say D, where D is dominant for brown and d is checkered. But the problem doesn't mention a third gene, so maybe it's simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a separate trait, making the bird always checkered when c is present, regardless of color.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Hmm, that's confusing because typically, the dominant allele masks the recessive one, but here it seems that c causes both the pattern (checkered) and the color (plain). That might mean that the bird cannot express both traits unless certain conditions are met. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the presence of the recessive allele as causing the pattern and color, but in reality, the pattern is fixed once the alleles are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to treat each gene separately, ignoring linkage, and thus the phenotypic ratio is indeed 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 (total 16)\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0 (total 16)\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Maybe the checkered pattern is dominant, and the color is codominant. Let me reconsider the setup. If the checkered pattern is dominant, then any bird with at least one 'c' allele will display the checkered pattern, regardless of the color. But the problem states that the plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So perhaps the presence of the recessive allele leads to both the pattern and color being plain. Wait, that contradicts the usual genetic model where the recessive allele masks the dominant. So maybe the problem is structured differently, perhaps considering that the checkered pattern is expressed even when the color is brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the two traits separately, leading to four phenotypes: checkered brown, plain brown, checkered red, and plain red, but with different ratios based on the dominance of the genes.\n\nLet me try another approach. Each gene contributes to the phenotype:\n\n- Gene C: \n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n\n- Gene B:\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the checkered pattern is determined by c, and the plain color by c, perhaps the combination is such that having c in either gene results in the respective phenotype. But the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by c, implying that c causes the pattern, and the color may be influenced by another gene. However, the problem doesn't specify another gene, so maybe it's treated as a separate trait.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes would be based on whether the bird is checkered (c) or plain (cc), and whether it's brown (B) or plain (bb). So:\n\n1. Checkered and brown (cB): Phenotype depends on B.\n2. Checkered and plain (cc): Phenotype depends on c.\n3. Plain and brown (Bb): Phenotype depends on B.\n4. Plain and plain (bb): Phenotype depends on c.\n\nAssuming that the presence of B makes the bird brown, and the presence of c makes the bird plain, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. cB \u2192 brown checkered\n2. cc \u2192 plain checkered\n3. Bb \u2192 brown plain\n4. bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that checkered is determined by c, so perhaps the checkered pattern is always present if c is present, regardless of the color. Alternatively, perhaps the color is expressed regardless of the pattern. This complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of c in either gene results in the respective phenotype, ignoring the other gene. But that doesn't align with standard genetic principles. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a simplified system where the presence of c in either gene leads to the respective phenotype, and the other gene's effect is ignored.\n\nIn that case:\n\n1. Any bird with at least one c (either gene) will have the checkered pattern (cB or cc).\n   - If it also has a dominant B (B_), it will be brown.\n   - If it has a recessive b (bb), it will be plain.\n   \nSimilarly, if it has at least one c (cc), it will be plain, regardless of B.\n\nThis interpretation would lead to the following phenotypes:\n\n1. cB \u2192 brown checkered\n2. cc \u2192 plain checkered\n3. Bb \u2192 brown plain\n4. bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nNow, the ratios would depend on the proportion of each genotype:\n\n- For cB (from cB):\n  - Probability of having at least one c: 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/3 * 1/3) = 8/9\n  - Within those, the proportion of B_ (B_) is (2/3 * 2/3) + (2/3 * 1/3) = (4/9 + 2/9) = 6/9 = 2/3\n  - So overall, cB (brown checkered): (8/9) * (2/3) = 16/27 \u2248 0.5926\n\n- For cc (plain checkered):\n  - Probability: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n  - All of these are plain checkered, regardless of B.\n\n- For Bb (brown plain):\n  - Probability: (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n    - Within these, the proportion of B_ is 2/3\n    - So Bb (brown plain): (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27 \u2248 0.2963\n\n- For bb (plain plain):\n  - Probability: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 16/27 + 1/9 + 8/27 + 1/9 = (16 + 3 + 8 + 1)/27 = 28/27, which exceeds 1. Clearly, this approach is flawed. Instead, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for each gene, the presence of c leads to the respective phenotype, and the other gene's effect is considered as additional, but in reality, they are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem simplifies by treating each gene separately, leading to four phenotypic categories, each with specific ratios. Given the options, option E seems to have a ratio of 3:9:1:3, totaling 16. Let me see how that comes about. Perhaps the number of genotypic combinations leading to each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered and brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 chance for c, 1/3 for B \u2192 1/9\n2. Checkered and plain: (cc) \u2192 1/3^2 = 1/9\n3. Plain and brown: (Bb) \u2192 2*(1/3*2/3) = 4/9\n4. Plain and plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nIf we ignore the order and consider the phenotypic ratios directly, the counts would be proportional to the number of ways each phenotype can occur. So:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 4/9 (since 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 for cB, but considering both c and B, it's 1/9)\n2. Checkered plain: 1/9\n3. Plain brown: 4/9\n4. Plain plain: 1/9\n\nTotaling 10/9, which is more than 1, indicating a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each type of genotype:\n\nCheckered brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\nCheckered plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\nPlain brown: (Bb) \u2192 2/9\nPlain plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios are based on the sum of each phenotype across all genotypes. Since each genotype leads to a specific phenotype, the ratios are 1:1:2:1. Converting to whole numbers by multiplying each by 8 to get rid of denominators, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:2:1, translating to 1 checkered brown, 1 checkered plain, 2 plain brown, 1 plain plain, giving a total of 5 parts, which doesn't match any given option.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 (sum 16). How does this come about? Perhaps the counts are based on the number of ways each phenotype can occur, considering each gene separately. For example:\n\n1. Checkered brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n2. Checkered plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\n3. Plain brown: (Bb) \u2192 4/9 (since each B and b can happen twice)\n4. Plain plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nBut then the ratio would be 1:1:4:1, which sums to 7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the phenotypic ratios without considering the dominance in terms of probability, but rather counting the number of possible phenotypes. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 1 (cB)\n2. Checkered plain: 1 (cc)\n3. Plain brown: 2 (Bb)\n4. Plain plain: 1 (bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:2:1, which totals 5 parts. But none of the options reflect this exactly. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. This suggests that perhaps the problem counts each allele possibility without considering dominance, treating each gene's outcome independently. For example:\n\n- For the checkered pattern (c):\n  - Any bird with at least one c is checkered.\n  - The color is determined by the B gene: brown (B_) or plain (bb).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n2. Checkered plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\n3. Plain brown: (Bb) \u2192 2/9\n4. Plain plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nAgain, the ratio is 1:1:2:1, which doesn't match any option except perhaps E if considering a different scaling factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of possible alleles instead of genotypic combinations. For instance:\n\nEach bird contributes two alleles per gene. For the checkered pattern, if c is present, the bird is checkered regardless of the other gene. Similarly, if B is present, it's brown, else plain.\n\nSo, for each bird, the number of checkered and brown alleles determines the phenotype.\n\n- cB: checkered brown (2)\n- cb: checkered plain (1)\n- Bb: brown plain (2)\n- bb: plain plain (1)\n\nBut this approach treats each allele as contributing to the phenotype, not the genotype. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each type:\n\nCheckered brown: 2 (from cB)\nCheckered plain: 1 (from cb)\nBrown plain: 2 (from Bb)\nPlain plain: 1 (from bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 2:1:2:1, which sums to 6. But none of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers each gene independently, leading to four phenotypes with specific counts. For example:\n\n- Checkered brown: (cB) \u2192 1\n- Checkered plain: (cc) \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: (Bb) \u2192 2\n- Plain plain: (bb) \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 5. Again, not matching any option.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. This could be interpreted as 3 checkered brown, 9 checkered plain, 1 plain brown, and 3 plain plain. To arrive at these numbers, perhaps the problem considers each gene's contribution multiplicatively. For example:\n\n- For each bird, the probability of being checkered (c) is 1/3, and the probability of being plain (cc) is 1/3.\n  - Among checkered (c), the probability of having a brown color (B_) is 2/3, and plain (b) is 1/3.\n    - So, checkered brown: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n    - Checkered plain: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n  - Among plain (cc), the color is always plain, so:\n    - Plain brown: 0\n    - Plain plain: 1/9\n\nBut this still doesn't explain the 3:9:1:3 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype, and ignores the other gene's effect. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele (either C or B), it exhibits the respective phenotype.\n- Otherwise, it's the opposite.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered and brown: (cB) \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n2. Checkered and plain: (cc) \u2192 1/9\n3. Plain and brown: (Bb) \u2192 4/9\n4. Plain and plain: (bb) \u2192 1/9\n\nBut again, this leads to a ratio of 1:1:4:1, which doesn't match any option.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting us to use a Punnett square for F2 and analyze the phenotypes based on the expected ratios without considering dominance beyond what's stated. Let me construct the Punnett square for F2:\n\nParents: CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: Genotypes formed by crossing F1 with itself.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are:\n\n- C B\n- C b\n- c B\n- c b\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nC C B B \u2192 1/16\nC C B b \u2192 2/16\nC C b B \u2192 2/16\nC c B B \u2192 2/16\nC c B b \u2192 2/16\nC c c B \u2192 2/16\nC c c b \u2192 2/16\nc c B B \u2192 1/16\nc c B b \u2192 1/16\nc c c B \u2192 1/16\nc c c b \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C C B B \u2192 Checkered (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C C B b \u2192 Checkered (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C C b B \u2192 Checkered (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. C c B B \u2192 Checkered (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. C c",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype. However, the overall F2 phenotype ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for the combination of both genes. But since the options given don't match this exactly, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation, which is the second generation after the first selfing. So if the F1 is CcBb, then F2 would be the results of F1 \u00d7 F1. But the F1 itself is the result of CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, producing CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) would produce F2. But the user provided a detailed list of gametes for F1, which might suggest that the F1 themselves are the parents for the next generation, but that doesn't make sense because F1 is F1, and F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 selfing, leading to F2, but that's not what's being asked. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps I misread earlier. The problem states that the parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CC BB \u00d7 cc bb \u2192 F1: CcBb. Then F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1. So the task is to create the Punnett square for F2, which is the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes would come from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Each F1 contributes either CB or cb gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nWait, but that's only four possibilities. However, considering independent assortment, each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes, so the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nBut wait, since the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the two genes. So for each gene separately:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- Presence (C): dominant (red)\n- Absence (c): recessive (plain)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio for C would be 3:1 (red : plain).\n\nFor B (color):\n- Presence (B): dominant (brown)\n- Absence (b): recessive (checkered)\n\nSimilarly, the phenotypic ratio for B would be 3:1 (brown : checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red/brown, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for red/brown, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for plain/brown, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for plain/checkered.\n\nBut looking at the answer options provided, none seem to directly match this 9:3:3:1 ratio divided into four categories. Instead, the options are grouped differently, such as \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" etc. This suggests that the phenotypic ratio is categorized by phenotype type rather than by the actual genetic makeup. \n\nIn other words, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: This would occur when both genes are recessive (cc bb), resulting in checkered (c) and red (C).\n2. Checkered brown: This would require the B gene to be dominant (B) but the c for checkered (since the c is recessive for pigment, but checkered is due to c, while B is for brown.\n   Wait, no: the checkered color is due to the c allele for pigment (so c), regardless of the B gene. Brown is due to the B allele (B). So checkered brown would be when both alleles are recessive (cc bb), resulting in checkered (c) and brown (B).\n   \nCheckered red would be when the c allele is dominant (C), and the B allele is recessive (b), i.e., cB.\nCheckered brown is when c is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b), i.e., cb.\n\nPlain red would be when C is dominant (C) and c is recessive (c), so CcBb (since B is dominant, brown, but B isn't needed for plain, so it's CcBb where B is present but it's plain because c is dominant for pigment? Wait, no: checkered is c (for pigment), and B is brown. Plain is when C is dominant (C) and c is recessive (c), but also when B is recessive (b), making the bird plain color regardless of B. Wait, no: the color depends on B and c. So checkered is c (regardless of B), and plain is c (regardless of B). Similarly, brown is B (regardless of c), and checkered is c (regardless of B). So:\n\n- Checkered red: cB (phenotype)\n- Checkered brown: cb (phenotype)\n- Plain red: cc (phenotype)\n- Plain brown: Cb (phenotype)\n\nSo now, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cB \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered brown: cb \u2192 25%\n3. Plain red: cc \u2192 25%\n4.

Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014again, adding up to 16, but the numbers don't align with the 9:3:3:1 split. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014also sums to 16, but different distribution.\n\nOption C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014this matches the 9:3:3:1 split exactly. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014doesn't add up. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014doesn't fit. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\"\u2014this seems to divide equally, which isn't the case for a 9:3:3:1 ratio unless all four are considered together, but in reality, it's a 9:3:3:1, so the correct grouping would reflect that.\n\nLooking back, the correct grouping according to phenotype is:\n\n- 9% checkered red (cc)\n- 3% checkered brown (cb)\n- 3% plain red (cc)\n- 1% plain brown (Cb)\n\nBut none of the options provide this exact breakdown except for option C. Wait, option C lists \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which indeed matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G has \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which would sum to 16, but that's not how the 9:3:3:1 works. Option A has \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\u2014summing to 16, but again, it doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 split.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option C, which groups the phenotypes according to their dominance status without splitting them further.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014also sums to 16, but different distribution.\n\nOption C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014this matches the 9:3:3:1 split exactly.

Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\"\u2014this seems to divide equally, which isn't the case for a 9:3:3:1 ratio unless all four are considered together, but in reality, it's a 9:3:3:1, so the correct grouping would reflect that.\n\nLooking back, the correct grouping according to phenotype is:\n\n- 9% checkered red (cc)\n- 3% checkered brown (cb)\n- 3% plain red (cc)\n- 1% plain brown (Cb)\n\nBut none of the options provide this exact breakdown except for option C. Wait, option C lists \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which indeed matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G has \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which would sum to 16, but that's not how the 9:3:3:1 works. Option A has \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\u2014summing to 16, but again, it doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 split.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option C, which groups the phenotypes according to their dominance status without splitting them further.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is present or not.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is present or not. So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total number of phenotypes is 2 x 2 = 4. But the actual phenotypes observed may vary depending on dominance. Alternatively, since each gene is completely dominant, any presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nSo for Pigmentation (C):\n- C present \u2192 red (dominant)\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant, so the most dominant phenotype)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Red Plain\n\nBut wait, if both C and B are absent, then the phenotype is Red Plain. If C is present but B is absent, it's Checkered Plain. If C is absent but B is present, it's Red Brown. If both are present, it's Checkered Brown.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach gene independently contributes to the phenotype. Since each parent contributes a gamete, the probability of each genotype in F2 is as follows:\n\n- For C:\n  - Presence (C) in F2: 3/4 (probability of being CB or cc)\n  - Absence (c) in F2: 1/4 (probability of being cb)\n\n- For B:\n  - Presence (B) in F2: 3/4 (probability of being CB or bb)\n  - Absence (b) in F2: 1/4 (probability of being cb)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore:\n\n- C Present (3/4) AND B Present (3/4) \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 1): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C Present (3/4) AND B Absent (1/4) \u2192 Checkered Plain: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C Absent (1/4) AND B Present (3/4) \u2192 Red Brown: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both Absent (1/4 * 1/4) \u2192 Red Plain: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense. Now, converting fractions to ratios:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Checkered Plain: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Red Brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Red Plain: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none of them directly match this. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16?\nWait, adding 6+2+6+2=16, but according to our calculation, it's 9,3,3,1, totaling 16.\n\nLooking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the phenotypic categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is different. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the bird's appearance, which is influenced by both genes. So the possible phenotypes could also include \"plain\" and \"brown,\" regardless of the pigmentation gene. Wait, but no\u2014the problem states that checkered is due to the recessive allele c, while plain is due to c. Similarly, brown is due to B, and plain due to b. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Red Plain\n\nIn terms of dominance, since C is dominant, having at least one C allele leads to red color. Similarly, B is dominant, leading to brown. So the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered Brown : Checkered Plain : Red Brown : Red Plain = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to 9/16 Checkered Brown, 3/16 Checkered Plain, 3/16 Red Brown, 1/16 Red Plain. However, the options don't seem to reflect this exactly. Looking at option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16 but shows different numbers.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for dihybrid crosses: (9:3:3:1), but adjusted for the presence of dominant traits.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each gene can be expressed or not, and the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait, the total phenotypic ratio would be based on the sum of the products of the individual ratios.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Presence (C): 3 parts (since 3/4)\n- Absence (c): 1 part (1/4)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Presence (B): 3 parts (3/4)\n- Absence (b): 1 part (1/4)\n\nThe phenotypic ratios would be the combinations where at least one dominant allele is present for each gene.

The user said: \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\" So the parents are Homozygous CC BB (but that seems impossible because CC BB implies both C and B are dominant, but the bird is described as being checkered, which is typically due to the c allele. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the description. Let me re-express the parents correctly.\n\nWait, the parents are:\n- Parent 1: Checkered red \u2192 which would have alleles C (since red is dominant) and c (since checkered is recessive). Similarly, for color, since red is dominant, B (for brown) is dominant as well. Wait, no\u2014red is determined by the C allele, and checkered is determined by the c allele. Brown is determined by B, and checkered by b. So a checkered bird would be homozygous recessive for both genes, i.e., cc bb.\n\nWait, but if the parents are:\n- Homozygous checkered red: This would mean CC (for pigment) and BB (for color), but wait, checkered implies the recessive c alleles. Wait, no\u2014it's a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment: C (dominant, red) vs. c (recessive, plain)\n- Color: B (dominant, brown) vs. b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo a checkered bird would be cc bb because it has both recessive alleles. A plain bird would be CC BB, but wait\u2014that's not possible because a bird cannot be both CC (pigment) and BB (color) unless it's homozygous for both genes. Wait, perhaps the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 cc bb (both recessive alleles)\n- Parent 2: Homozygous red plain \u2192 CC BB (both dominant alleles)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the F1 would be heterozygotes: CcBb. Then, F2 would come from F1 selfing. But the user says \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". That suggests that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which is confusing because a bird can't be both CC BB and cc bb at the same time. Perhaps there's a typo, but proceeding with the assumption that the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nThen, the F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous). F2 would be from F1 selfing, leading to a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- cc (if both parents contribute c)\n- bb (if both parents contribute b)\n\nBut considering the parents are CC BB and cc bb, each parent can only contribute one allele. Wait, no\u2014the parents are homozygous, so each parent can only contribute one allele. Thus, F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele (C/B from one parent and c/b from the other).\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Each parent can only contribute one allele, so F1 would be Cc for pigment (since one parent has C and the other has c) and Bb for color (one parent has B, the other has b). Wait, that can't be right because the parents are homozygous. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB, meaning both C and B alleles are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both c and b alleles are recessive. They can only produce gametes based on their own alleles. So Parent 1 can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb (C from Parent 1, c from Parent 2; B from Parent 1, b from Parent 2). Then, F2 would result from F1 selfing, producing four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but each parent can only contribute one allele, so the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n- Parent 1 contributes C and B,\n- Parent 2 contributes c and b.\n\nWhen selfing, F2 would receive gametes from each parent, so each parent can contribute either C or c, and B or b. Wait, but since each parent is homozygous, they can only pass one allele. So F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- CC (if both parents contributed C),\n- Cc (if one parent contributed C and the other contributed c),\n- cc (if both parents contributed c),\n- BB (if both parents contributed B),\n- Bb (if one parent contributed B and the other contributed b),\n- bB (same as Bb),\n- bb (if both parents contributed b).\n\nBut considering the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the possible F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n- CC (from C/C)\n- Cc (from C/c)\n- cc (from c/c)\n- BB (from B/B)\n- Bb (from B/b)\n- bb (from b/b)\n\nWait, but this is under the assumption that each parent can only contribute one allele. However, in reality, for dihybrid crosses, each parent can contribute either allele, leading to four possible gametes per parent, resulting in 16 possible F2 genotypes. But since our parents are homozygous, each parent can only contribute one allele. So the F2 would have:\n\n- CC (only possible from C/C)\n- Cc (possible from C/c)\n- cc (only possible from c/c)\n- BB (only possible from B/B)\n- Bb (possible from B/b)\n- bb (only possible from b/b)\n\nWait, but for each gene, the possible gametes are C and c for pigment, and B and b for color. So in F2, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment and/or color would exhibit the corresponding phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated based on the possible genotypes. For each gene:\n\n- Pigment (C): Dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- Color (B): Dominant (B) \u2192 brown; recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. For each gene, the presence of a dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- For pigment: 3:1 (red : plain)\n- For color: 3:1 (brown : checkered)\n\nThus, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)(3/4) + (3/4)(1/4) + ... but this approach isn't straightforward. Alternatively, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nHowever, a simpler method is to recognize that the dihybrid cross from a homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant parent (as described earlier) would yield a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. But in reality, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 would be a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. But let's verify that.\n\nWait, no, if both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the result of selfing F1, leading to:\n\n- 25% CC (all C and B dominant)\n- 25% Cc (either C or c, but B is present)\n- 25% cc (both c alleles)\n- 25% bb (all b alleles)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red brown\n- Cc: red checkered\n- cc: plain brown\n- bb: plain checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype?\n\nEach of these categories (CC, Cc, cc, bb) appears 25% of the time. However, since each gene's presence affects the phenotype, the actual counts depend on the number of dominant alleles. But since the question asks for phenotypic ratios, regardless of the underlying genotype, we can look at the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the F2:\n\n- CC: red brown \u2192 25%\n- Cc: red checkered \u2192 25%\n- cc: plain brown \u2192 25%\n- bb: plain checkered \u2192 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, with each phenotype occurring equally often. Looking back at the options provided, option E is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That also sums to 16. Option D is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which adds to 16. Option J is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" totaling 12. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" adding to 16. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which totals 16.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, all four phenotypes should occur equally (25% each), so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options exactly match this. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:1. So option F is correct. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that applies to two separate traits without considering their interaction. In this case, since the genes are independent, the combined ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1. So the answer should be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

So F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- CC (if both parents contributed C),\n- Cc (if one parent contributed C and the other contributed c),\n- cc (if both parents contributed c),\n- BB (if both parents contributed B),\n- Bb (if one parent contributed B and the other contributed b),\n- bB (same as Bb),\n- bb (if both parents contributed b).\n\nBut considering the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the possible F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n- CC (from C/C)\n- Cc (from C/c)\n- cc (from c/c)\n- BB (from B/B)\n- Bb (from B/b)\n- bb (from b/b)\n\nWait, but this is under the assumption that each parent can only contribute one allele. However, in reality, for dihybrid crosses, each parent can contribute either allele, leading to four possible gametes per parent, resulting in 16 possible F2 genotypes. But since our parents are homozygous, each parent can only contribute one allele. So the F2 would have:\n\n- CC (only possible from C/C)\n- Cc (possible from C/c)\n- cc (only possible from c/c)\n- BB (only possible from B/B)\n- Bb (possible from B/b)\n- bb (only possible from b/b)\n\nWait, but for each gene, the possible gametes are C and c for pigment, and B and b for color. So in F2, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment and/or color would exhibit the corresponding phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated based on the possible genotypes. For each gene:\n\n- Pigment (C): Dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- Color (B): Dominant (B) \u2192 brown; recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. For each gene, the presence of a dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- For pigment: 3:1 (red : plain)\n- For color: 3:1 (brown : checkered)\n\nThus, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)(3/4) + (3/4)(1/4) + ... but this approach isn't straightforward. Alternatively, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nHowever, a simpler method is to recognize that the dihybrid cross from a homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant parent (as described earlier) would yield a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. But in reality, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 would be a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. But let's verify that.\n\nWait, no, if both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the result of selfing F1, leading to:\n\n- 25% CC (all C and B dominant)\n- 25% Cc (either C or c, but B is present)\n- 25% cc (both c alleles)\n- 25% bb (all b alleles)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red brown\n- Cc: red checkered\n- cc: plain brown\n- bb: plain checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype?\n\nEach of these categories (CC, Cc, cc, bb) appears 25% of the time. However, since each gene's presence affects the phenotype, the actual counts depend on the number of dominant alleles. But since the question asks for phenotypic ratios, regardless of the underlying genotype, we can look at the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the F2:\n\n- CC: red brown \u2192 25%\n- Cc: red checkered \u2192 25%\n- cc: plain brown \u2192 25%\n- bb: plain checkered \u2192 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, with each phenotype occurring equally often. Looking back at the options provided, option E is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That also sums to 16. Option D is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which adds to 16. Option J is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" totaling 12. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" adding to 16. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which totals 16.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, all four phenotypes should occur equally (25% each), so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options exactly match this. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:1. So option F is correct. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that applies to two separate traits without considering their interaction. In this case, since the genes are independent, the combined ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1. So the answer should be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So, each gene contributes a factor to the overall phenotype.",
    "rollout": " So, each gene contributes a factor to the overall phenotype. The total number of phenotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Now, for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 and absent is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is multiplied. So:\n\n- Both C and B are present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red brown\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 red checkered\n- C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 plain brown\n- Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, but the options given don't include 9:3:3:1 ratios. Instead, looking at the options, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which doesn't match our calculation. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor C: C > c, so any presence of C results in red pigment.\nFor B: B > b, so any presence of B results in brown color.\n\nSo, the phenotypes can be ordered as follows:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and brown (b): plain brown (since both c and b are recessive)\n2. Checkered (c) and red (C): plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): brown\n4. Plain (c) and red (C): red\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are all four possible combinations: CC BB (100%), CC Bb (1/4), CC bb (1/4), Cc BB (1/4), Cc Bb (1/2), Cc bb (1/4), cc BB (1/4), cc Bb (1/4), cc bb (1/4). But wait, this seems too detailed. Alternatively, each gene segregates independently, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc. However, for phenotypic analysis, we group them by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- Cc BB: C present, B absent \u2192 red plain\n- Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- Cc bb: C present, B absent \u2192 red plain\n- cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, this still gets complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 chance absent (recessive).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities combine multiplicatively.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red plain\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain plain\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking through the options, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, which fits the denominator of 16. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which also sums to 16. Option A is \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me double-check. Each phenotype corresponds to the presence of dominant alleles for either or both genes. The correct way to count is to sum the probabilities of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the formula for F2 phenotypic ratios when two loci are involved with independent inheritance and dominant/recessive relationships. Here's how:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C B (Red Brown)\n2. C b (Red Plain)\n3. cc B (Plain Brown)\n4. cc b (Plain Plain)\n\nThe frequency of each is:\n\n1. (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these gives 16 parts, which matches the denominator of 16. Now, converting each part to numbers:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16x (assuming 16 individuals for simplicity)\nPhenotype counts:\n- Red Brown: 9x\n- Red Plain: 3x\n- Plain Brown: 3x\n- Plain Plain: 1x\n\nHowever, none of the answer options directly reflect this. Let me look again. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That adds up to 2+6+3+1=12, which isn't 16. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" adding to 16. But according to my calculations, checkered red (which would correspond to cc bb) is 1/16, which would translate to 1 if we have 16 individuals. However, option E suggests checkered red is 3, which might be 3/16 of 16, but 3/16 times 16 is indeed 3. Similarly, checkered brown would be 9, which is 9/16 of 16. But according to the options, checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would imply that the checkered red phenotype (cc bb) is 3, which is 3/16, but according to my earlier breakdown, checkered red is 1/16, which would be 1. So there's inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the presence of dominant alleles rather than specific phenotypes. But the question clearly states the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the F2 generation includes the possibility of the genes being in different states beyond the simple Punnett square approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different method to determine the phenotypic ratios, such as counting the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 population without relying solely on the Punnett square.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps I should refer back to the original setup. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 ratio when two traits are under independent control would typically follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in this case, the dominance hierarchy complicates things. Let me try to apply the 9:3:3:1 principle.\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: (C_B_) \u2192 9\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (C_bb) \u2192 3\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (cc_B_) \u2192 3\n4. Both recessive: (ccc_c) \u2192 1\n\nAssuming that in the F2 generation, each of these categories corresponds to the phenotypes described. Now, translating these into the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio where checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. But according to the 9:3:3:1, the order should be:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_) \u2192 9\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb) \u2192 3\n3. Plain red (cc_B_) \u2192 3\n4. Plain brown (ccc_c) \u2192 1\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red being 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, and plain brown 1. But none of the answer options directly say 9:3:3:1. However, option E lists checkered red as 3, which would correspond to 3/16 of the population, whereas according to the 9:3:3:1, checkered red should be 9/16. So option E doesn't fit.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nNone of these match the 9:3:3:1 except option C. So, perhaps the intended answer is option C, assuming that the question is referring to the 9:3:3:1 ratio regardless of the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the ratio in terms of phenotypic classes, treating each phenotype as a separate category.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to go with option C, as it reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, even though the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypic expression. Alternatively, the correct answer may involve considering the dominance hierarchy differently. \n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the correct way to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio involves considering the actual genotypes and their probabilities, then mapping those to the phenotypes. Using the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (probability 1/16)\n2. CC Bb (2/16)\n3. Cc BB (2/16)\n4. Cc Bb (2/16)\n5. Cc bb (2/16)\n6. cc BB (1/16)\n7. cc Bb (2/16)\n8. cc bb (1/16)\n\nThen, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 red plain\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 red plain\n6. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n7. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Red Brown: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 (Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me recount.)\n\nActually, each genotype corresponds to a single phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (1/16)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (2/16)\n3. Cc BB \u2192 red plain (2/16)\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown (2/16)\n5. Cc bb \u2192 red plain (2/16)\n6. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (1/16)\n7. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (2/16)\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain plain (1/16)\n\nSo total for each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: (1 + 2 + 2 + 2)/16 = 7/16\n- Red Plain: (2 + 2)/16 = 4/16\n- Plain Brown: (1 + 2)/16 = 3/16\n- Plain Plain: 1/16\n\nThis gives a ratio of 7:4:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the correct approach is to use the 9:3:3:1 ratio based on dominance hierarchy, despite the complexities of the problem.\n\nGiven that, option C states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which aligns with the typical 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio when considering dominance. Thus, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So, each gene contributes a factor to the overall phenotype. The total number of phenotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Now, for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 and absent is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is multiplied. So:\n\n- Both C and B are present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red brown\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 red checkered\n- C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 plain brown\n- Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, but the options given don't include 9:3:3:1 ratios. Instead, looking at the options, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which doesn't match our calculation. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor C: C > c, so any presence of C results in red pigment.\nFor B: B > b, so any presence of B results in brown color.\n\nSo, the phenotypes can be ordered as follows:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and brown (b): plain brown (since both c and b are recessive)\n2. Checkered (c) and red (C): plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): brown\n4. Plain (c) and red (C): red\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are all four possible combinations: CC BB (100%), CC Bb (1/4), CC bb (1/4), Cc BB (1/4), Cc Bb (1/2), Cc bb (1/4), cc BB (1/4), cc Bb (1/4), cc bb (1/4). But wait, this seems too detailed. Alternatively, each gene segregates independently, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc. However, for phenotypic analysis, we group them by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- Cc BB: C present, B absent \u2192 red plain\n- Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- Cc bb: C present, B absent \u2192 red plain\n- cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, this still gets complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 chance absent (recessive).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities combine multiplicatively.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red plain\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain plain\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking through the options, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, which fits the denominator of 16. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which also sums to 16. Option A is \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me double-check. Each phenotype corresponds to the presence of dominant alleles for either or both genes. The correct way to count is to sum the probabilities of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the formula for F2 phenotypic ratios when two loci are involved with independent inheritance and dominant/recessive relationships. Here's how:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C B (Red Brown)\n2. C b (Red Plain)\n3. cc B (Plain Brown)\n4. cc b (Plain Plain)\n\nThe frequency of each is:\n\n1. (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these gives 16 parts, which matches the denominator of 16. Now, converting each part to numbers:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16x (assuming 16 individuals for simplicity)\nPhenotype counts:\n- Red Brown: 9x\n- Red Plain: 3x\n- Plain Brown: 3x\n- Plain Plain: 1x\n\nHowever, none of the answer options directly reflect this. Let me look again. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That adds up to 2+6+3+1=12, which isn't 16. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" adding to 16. But according to my calculations, checkered red (which would correspond to cc bb) is 1/16, which would translate to 1 if we have 16 individuals. However, option E suggests checkered red is 3, which might be 3/16 of 16, but 3/16 times 16 is indeed 3. Similarly, checkered brown would be 9, which is 9/16 of 16. But according to the options, checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would imply that the checkered red phenotype (cc bb) is 3, which is 3/16, but according to my earlier breakdown, checkered red is 1/16, which would be 1. So there's inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the presence of dominant alleles rather than specific phenotypes. But the question clearly states the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the F2 generation includes the possibility of the genes being in different states beyond the simple Punnett square approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different method to determine the phenotypic ratios, such as counting the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 population without relying solely on the Punnett square.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps I should refer back to the original setup. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 ratio when two traits are under independent control would typically follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in this case, the dominance hierarchy complicates things. Let me try to apply the 9:3:3:1 principle.\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: (C_B_) \u2192 9\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (C_bb) \u2192 3\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (cc_B_) \u2192 3\n4. Both recessive: (ccc_c) \u2192 1\n\nAssuming that in the F2 generation, each of these categories corresponds to the phenotypes described. Now, translating these into the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio where checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. But according to the 9:3:3:1, the order should be:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_) \u2192 9\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb) \u2192 3\n3. Plain red (cc_B_) \u2192 3\n4. Plain brown (ccc_c) \u2192 1\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red being 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, and plain brown 1. But none of the answer options directly say 9:3:3:1. However, option E lists checkered red as 3, which would correspond to 3/16 of the population, whereas according to the 9:3:3:1, checkered red should be 9/16. So option E doesn't fit.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nNone of these match the 9:3:3:1 except option C. So, perhaps the intended answer is option C, assuming that the question is referring to the 9:3:3:1 ratio regardless of the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the ratio in terms of phenotypic classes, treating each phenotype as a separate category.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to go with option C, as it reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, even though the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypic expression. Alternatively, the correct answer may involve considering the dominance hierarchy differently. \n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the correct way to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio involves considering the actual genotypes and their probabilities, then mapping those to the phenotypes. Using the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (probability 1/16)\n2. CC Bb (2/16)\n3. Cc BB (2/16)\n4. Cc Bb (2/16)\n5. Cc bb (2/16)\n6. cc BB (1/16)\n7. cc Bb (2/16)\n8. cc bb (1/16)\n\nThen, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 red plain\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 red plain\n6. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n7. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Red Brown: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 (Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me recount.)\n\nActually, each genotype corresponds to a single phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (1/16)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (2/16)\n3. Cc BB \u2192 red plain (2/16)\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown (2/16)\n5. Cc bb \u2192 red plain (2/16)\n6. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (1/16)\n7. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (2/16)\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain plain (1/16)\n\nSo total for each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: (1 + 2 + 2 + 2)/16 = 7/16\n- Red Plain: (2 + 2)/16 = 4/16\n- Plain Brown: (1 + 2)/16 = 3/16\n- Plain Plain: 1/16\n\nThis gives a ratio of 7:4:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the correct approach is to use the 9:3:3:1 ratio based on dominance hierarchy, despite the complexities of the problem.\n\nGiven that, option C states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which aligns with the typical 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio when considering dominance. Thus, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has three phenotypic categories.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has three phenotypic categories. However, in reality, for a dihybrid cross, the number of phenotypes depends on how many are distinct. But in this case, all four combinations (C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b) might lead to different phenotypes if the genes interact. Alternatively, some phenotypes may combine into fewer than four due to dominance. Wait, but the question says \"complete a Punnett square,\" implying that all combinations are considered. So let's proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically. The F2 generation is formed by the F1 selfing, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n- CB + cB: CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n- CB + cb: same as above\n- cb + cb: cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cb + cB: CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb: same as above\n- cB + cB: cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cB + cb: CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb: same as above\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps a Punnett square will help. Let's create it:\n\n       | CB    | cb\n-------|--------|-----\n     CB    | CC BB (red) | CcBb (brown)\n     cb    | CcBB (brown) | cc bb (brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is either CB or cb. So the F2 would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red)\n- 50% CcBb (brown)\n- 25% cc bb (brown)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (since both C and B are dominant)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (because C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both b)\nWait, but in the given options, there's a mention of \"plain red\" and \"checkered brown.\" Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in the F2, the presence of the recessive alleles for each gene leads to different phenotypes. Specifically:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on both loci:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBB: C dominant, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC Bb: c present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc Bb: c present, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Both c present, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb: c present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc bb: C present, b present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Both c present, b present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps instead, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present or not. Since C is dominant (red), having at least one C allele results in red. Similarly, B being dominant (brown) results in brown. So any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will display the corresponding phenotype. Otherwise, it'll display the recessive phenotype. \n\nThus:\n\n- If C is present (either C or c), then it's red.\n- If B is present (either B or b), then it's brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (all c and b), then it's plain.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBB: Checkered brown\n- CC Bb: Plain brown\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain brown\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Only CC BB \u2192 1 instance\n- Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 1 instance\n- Plain brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 4 instances?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's recount:\n\nLooking back, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (1)\n- CcBB: Checkered brown (1)\n- CC Bb: Plain brown (1)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (1)\n- cc BB: Plain red (1)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (1)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (1)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (1)\n\nWait, that adds up to 8 instances across all phenotypes:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB)\nCheckered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, no\u2014I think earlier I miscounted. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CcBB \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. CC Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n5. CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n8. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that makes 9 instances across the phenotypes. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (from CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?)\nWait, no\u2014if CcBb is another phenotype, perhaps I need to clarify. Wait, CcBb would have both C and B dominant, leading to Checkered brown. Similarly, cc bb would have both recessives, leading to Plain brown. So the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (from CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, no, CcBb includes both C and B dominant, so it's Checkered brown. And Ccbb would be Checkered brown too? Wait, no\u2014Ccbb would have c present, so it's plain brown? No, because both alleles for B are present (B is dominant). Wait, let me get this straight.\n\nEach bird's genotype determines their phenotype. For example:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n- CcBB: Checkered brown (C dominant, B absent)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- CC Bb: Plain brown (C present, B absent)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- cc BB: Plain red (c present, B present)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (c present, B absent)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (C present, b absent)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (c present, b absent)\n\nWait, now I see. So the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to that phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (only one bird)\n- Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb? Wait, no\u2014CcBb and Ccbb are both Checkered brown because C is present and B is present in CcBb and B absent in Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014wait, Ccbb: B is present (since B is dominant), so it's Checkered brown? Or does B determine brownness regardless of c? Yes, B is dominant for brown, so even if c is present, the bird is brown. Similarly, CcBb: both C and B are present, so it's Checkered brown. Ccbb: C is present, B is present (since B is dominant), so it's Checkered brown. Wait, but why is Ccbb a separate category? No, it's still Checkered brown because C is present. So all CcBb and Ccbb are Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\ncc BB: c present, B present \u2192 Plain red\n\ncc Bb: c present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\ncc bb: c present, b present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, no. Wait, CcBB is Checkered brown, CcBb is Checkered brown, and Ccbb is Checkered brown as well because C is present. So that's 3 Checkered brown.\n\n- Plain red: 1 (cc BB)\n\n- Plain brown: 5 (CC Bb, CcBB, CcBb, cc Bb, cc bb?)\n\nWait, no:\n\n- CC Bb: Plain brown (C present, B absent)\n- CcBB: Checkered brown (C present, B dominant)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (C present, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (c present, B absent)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nSo:\n\n- Plain brown: 4 (CC Bb, CcBB, CcBb, cc Bb)\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n\nWait, but according to the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the user's options:\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios. Looking at option D: phenotypic ratio Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems inconsistent with my count where Checkered red is 1, Checkered brown is 3, Plain red is 1, and Plain brown is 5. So none of the options perfectly match my count. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype. So, for example:\n\n- If both C and B are present (CC BB), it's Checkered red.\n\n- If only C is present (CcBB), it's Checkered brown.\n\n- If only B is present (CC Bb), it's Plain brown.\n\n- If only c is present (cc BB), it's Plain red.\n\n- If only B is present (CcBb), it's Checkered brown.\n\n- If both c and B are present (cc Bb), it's Plain brown.\n\n- If both c and b are present (cc bb), it's Plain brown.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, Ccbb has c present, so it's plain brown. Wait, no\u2014CCBB is Checkered red, CcBB is Checkered brown, CC Bb is Plain brown, Cc Bb is Checkered brown, cc BB is Plain red, cc Bb is Plain brown, and cc bb is Plain brown.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb? Wait, Ccbb has c present, so it's Plain brown. So CcBb is Checkered brown, Ccbb is Plain brown.)\n\nWait, so:\n\n- CcBB: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: Plain brown\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Plain brown\n- CcBB: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (from CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb)\n- Plain red: 1 (cc BB)\n- Plain brown: 5 (CC Bb, CcBB, CcBb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nThis doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that suggests that plain red is 9, which contradicts our count of 1. Option E: Checkered red 3, plain red 9, which also doesn't fit. Option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThat's way off. Option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nStill not matching. Option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNope. Option B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nWait, that implies Checkered red is 8, which is higher than what I thought. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. In some cases, dominance is based on the order of alleles, where the later allele masks the effect of the previous. For example, in coat color, the order could be B (dominant, brown) followed by b (recessive, plain), making Bb black and bb plain. Similarly, for pigment color, the order could be B (dominant, red) followed by b (recessive, plain), making Bb brown and bb plain. If that's the case, then:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- BB: Brown (if B is dominant)\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Plain\n\nWait, but in this scenario, if the order is such that B masks b, then:\n\n- B (at least one B) leads to brown, and c leads to plain.\n\nSo for each gene, the dominant allele (B) leads to brown, and recessive (b) leads to plain, overriding the effect of the other gene.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene:\n\n- Both B and C present \u2192 brown\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red\n- B present, C absent \u2192 plain\n- Neither present \u2192 brown (since B is dominant, even if C is recessive).\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, if both B and C are dominant, it's brown. If only C is dominant, it's red. If only B is dominant, it's plain. If neither is dominant, it's brown because B is dominant.\n\nWait, but in the standard dominance notation, if B is dominant, then Bb and BB are brown, while bb is plain. Similarly, if C is dominant, then Cb and CC are red, while cc is plain.\n\nIf both B and C are dominant, it's brown, otherwise, it's red if only C is present, plain if only B is present, or brown if neither is present (but B is dominant, so if neither C nor B is present, B is dominant, so it should be brown). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again. Suppose the dominance order is B > b for the B locus (so B is dominant, leading to brown), and C > c for the C locus (C dominant, leading to red).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has three phenotypic categories. However, in reality, for a dihybrid cross, the number of phenotypes depends on how many are distinct. But in this case, all four combinations (C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b) might lead to different phenotypes if the genes interact. Alternatively, some phenotypes may combine into fewer than four due to dominance. Wait, but the question says \"complete a Punnett square,\" implying that all combinations are considered. So let's proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically. The F2 generation is formed by the F1 selfing, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n- CB + cB: CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n- CB + cb: same as above\n- cb + cb: cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cb + cB: CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb: same as above\n- cB + cB: cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cB + cb: CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb: same as above\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps a Punnett square will help. Let's create it:\n\n       | CB    | cb\n-------|--------|-----\n     CB    | CC BB (red) | CcBb (brown)\n     cb    | CcBB (brown) | cc bb (brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is either CB or cb. So the F2 would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red)\n- 50% CcBb (brown)\n- 25% cc bb (brown)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (since both C and B are dominant)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (because C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both b)\nWait, but in the given options, there's a mention of \"plain red\" and \"checkered brown.\" Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in the F2, the presence of the recessive alleles for each gene leads to different phenotypes. Specifically:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on both loci:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBB: C dominant, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC Bb: c present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc Bb: c present, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Both c present, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb: c present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc bb: C present, b present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Both c present, b present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps instead, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present or not. Since C is dominant (red), having at least one C allele results in red. Similarly, B being dominant (brown) results in brown. So any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will display the corresponding phenotype. Otherwise, it'll display the recessive phenotype. \n\nThus:\n\n- If C is present (either C or c), then it's red.\n- If B is present (either B or b), then it's brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (all c and b), then it's plain.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBB: Checkered brown\n- CC Bb: Plain brown\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain brown\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Only CC BB \u2192 1 instance\n- Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 1 instance\n- Plain brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 4 instances?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's recount:\n\nLooking back, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (1)\n- CcBB: Checkered brown (1)\n- CC Bb: Plain brown (1)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (1)\n- cc BB: Plain red (1)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (1)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (1)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (1)\n\nWait, that adds up to 8 instances across all phenotypes:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB)\nCheckered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, no\u2014I think earlier I miscounted. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CcBB \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. CC Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n5. CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n8. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that makes 9 instances across the phenotypes. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (from CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?)\nWait, no\u2014if CcBb is another phenotype, perhaps I need to clarify. Wait, CcBb would have both C and B dominant, leading to Checkered brown. Similarly, cc bb would have both recessives, leading to Plain brown. So the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (from CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, no, CcBb includes both C and B dominant, so it's Checkered brown. And Ccbb would be Checkered brown too? Wait, no\u2014Ccbb would have c present, so it's plain brown? No, because both alleles for B are present (B is dominant). Wait, let me get this straight.\n\nEach bird's genotype determines their phenotype. For example:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n- CcBB: Checkered brown (C dominant, B absent)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- CC Bb: Plain brown (C present, B absent)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- cc BB: Plain red (c present, B present)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (c present, B absent)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (C present, b absent)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (c present, b absent)\n\nWait, now I see. So the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to that phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (only one bird)\n- Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb? Wait, no\u2014CcBb and Ccbb are both Checkered brown because C is present and B is present in CcBb and B absent in Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014wait, Ccbb: B is present (since B is dominant), so it's Checkered brown? Or does B determine brownness regardless of c? Yes, B is dominant for brown, so even if c is present, the bird is brown. Similarly, CcBb: both C and B are present, so it's Checkered brown. Ccbb: C is present, B is present (since B is dominant), so it's Checkered brown. Wait, but why is Ccbb a separate category? No, it's still Checkered brown because C is present. So all CcBb and Ccbb are Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\ncc BB: c present, B present \u2192 Plain red\n\ncc Bb: c present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\ncc bb: c present, b present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, no. Wait, CcBB is Checkered brown, CcBb is Checkered brown, and Ccbb is Checkered brown as well because C is present. So that's 3 Checkered brown.\n\n- Plain red: 1 (cc BB)\n\n- Plain brown: 5 (CC Bb, CcBB, CcBb, cc Bb, cc bb?)\n\nWait, no:\n\n- CC Bb: Plain brown (C present, B absent)\n- CcBB: Checkered brown (C present, B dominant)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (C present, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (c present, B absent)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nSo:\n\n- Plain brown: 4 (CC Bb, CcBB, CcBb, cc Bb)\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n\nWait, but according to the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the user's options:\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios. Looking at option D: phenotypic ratio Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems inconsistent with my count where Checkered red is 1, Checkered brown is 3, Plain red is 1, and Plain brown is 5. So none of the options perfectly match my count. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype. So, for example:\n\n- If both C and B are present (CC BB), it's Checkered red.\n\n- If only C is present (CcBB), it's Checkered brown.\n\n- If only B is present (CC Bb), it's Plain brown.\n\n- If only c is present (cc BB), it's Plain red.\n\n- If only B is present (CcBb), it's Checkered brown.\n\n- If both c and B are present (cc Bb), it's Plain brown.\n\n- If both c and b are present (cc bb), it's Plain brown.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb?) Wait, Ccbb has c present, so it's plain brown. Wait, no\u2014CCBB is Checkered red, CcBB is Checkered brown, CC Bb is Plain brown, Cc Bb is Checkered brown, cc BB is Plain red, cc Bb is Plain brown, and cc bb is Plain brown.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb? Wait, Ccbb has c present, so it's Plain brown. So CcBb is Checkered brown, Ccbb is Plain brown.)\n\nWait, so:\n\n- CcBB: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: Plain brown\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Plain brown\n- CcBB: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3 (from CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb)\n- Plain red: 1 (cc BB)\n- Plain brown: 5 (CC Bb, CcBB, CcBb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nThis doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that suggests that plain red is 9, which contradicts our count of 1. Option E: Checkered red 3, plain red 9, which also doesn't fit. Option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThat's way off. Option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nStill not matching. Option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNope. Option B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nWait, that implies Checkered red is 8, which is higher than what I thought. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. In some cases, dominance is based on the order of alleles, where the later allele masks the effect of the previous. For example, in coat color, the order could be B (dominant, brown) followed by b (recessive, plain), making Bb black and bb plain. Similarly, for pigment color, the order could be B (dominant, red) followed by b (recessive, plain), making Bb brown and bb plain. If that's the case, then:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- BB: Brown (if B is dominant)\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Plain\n\nWait, but in this scenario, if the order is such that B masks b, then:\n\n- B (at least one B) leads to brown, and c leads to plain.\n\nSo for each gene, the dominant allele (B) leads to brown, and recessive (b) leads to plain, overriding the effect of the other gene.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene:\n\n- Both B and C present \u2192 brown\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red\n- B present, C absent \u2192 plain\n- Neither present \u2192 brown (since B is dominant, even if C is recessive).\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, if both B and C are dominant, it's brown. If only C is dominant, it's red. If only B is dominant, it's plain. If neither is dominant, it's brown because B is dominant.\n\nWait, but in the standard dominance notation, if B is dominant, then Bb and BB are brown, while bb is plain. Similarly, if C is dominant, then Cb and CC are red, while cc is plain.\n\nIf both B and C are dominant, it's brown, otherwise, it's red if only C is present, plain if only B is present, or brown if neither is present (but B is dominant, so if neither C nor B is present, B is dominant, so it should be brown). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again. Suppose the dominance order is B > b for the B locus (so B is dominant, leading to brown), and C > c for the C locus (C dominant, leading to red). Then, the phenotype would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene:\n\n- Both B and C present \u2192 brown (since B is dominant, and C is dominant)\n- At least one of B or C present \u2192 brown\n- Only B present \u2192 plain (since B is dominant, and C is recessive)\n- Only C present \u2192 red (since C is dominant, and B is recessive)\n- Neither present \u2192 brown (since B is dominant, even though C is recessive)\n\nWait, that can't be right. If B is dominant, then regardless of C, the bird is brown unless B is absent. So if B is absent (bb), but C is present (C_), then the bird is red. Wait, no\u2014since B is dominant, even if C is recessive, the bird is brown. So the presence of B (B_) leads to brown, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no\u2014this isn't quite right. Let's take an example:\n\n- B_ (regardless of C) \u2192 brown\n- bCC \u2192 brown (since B is dominant)\n- bCc \u2192 brown\n- bcc \u2192 brown (since B is dominant)\n- BCc \u2192 brown\n- bcC \u2192 brown\n- bcbc \u2192 brown (since B is dominant)\n\nOnly when B is absent (bb) do you get:\n\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- bbC \u2192 red\n- bb c \u2192 red\n- bbcc \u2192 red\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by whether B is present (leading to brown) or not (leading to red if B is absent and C is present, or plain if B is absent and C is also absent).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if B is present (B_), regardless of C, the bird is brown. If B is absent (bb), then:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If C is absent (cc), the bird is plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown: B_ (any combination of B and C)\n- Red: bbC_\n- Plain: bbcc\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: B_ and C_: Brown\n- CcBB: B_, C_: Brown\n- CC Bb: B_, Cb: Brown\n- CcBb: B_, Cb: Brown\n- cc BB: Bb (wait, cc is recessive for B, so B must be present for brown.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc) and absent is 1/4.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc) and absent is 1/4. However, the phenotypes aren't simply additive; they are multiplicative. So for example, if a bird is both C and B (C_B_), it would be red brown. If it's C and not B (C_bb), it would be plain brown. If it's not C but B (ccB_), it would be checkered brown. If neither C nor B (ccbb), then it would be checkered plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because the phenotype depends on the dominance. For the C gene: presence (C) leads to red, absence (c) leads to plain. Similarly, for B: presence (B) leads to brown, absence (b) leads to checkered. So the combined phenotype is:\n\n- C_B_: red brown\n- C_bb: plain brown\n- ccB_: checkered brown\n- ccbb: checkered plain\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each type based on the combination of the two genes. Each gene is inherited independently, so the total phenotypic ratio can be found by calculating the probabilities for each genotype and then determining the corresponding phenotype.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 chance of being absent (recessive). Since the genes are independent, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of the two genes and calculate the probability for each resulting phenotype.\n\n1. Both genes present (C_B_):\n   Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n   Phenotype: red brown\n\n2. C present, B absent (C_bb):\n   Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n   Phenotype: plain brown\n\n3. C absent, B present (ccB_):\n   Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n   Phenotype: checkered brown\n\n4. Both genes absent (ccbb):\n   Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n   Phenotype: checkered plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- red brown: 9/16\n- plain brown: 3/16\n- checkered brown: 3/16\n- checkered plain: 1/16\n\nTo express this as a ratio, we can multiply numerator counts by 16:\n\n- red brown: 9 parts\n- plain brown: 3 parts\n- checkered brown: 3 parts\n- checkered plain: 1 part\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our calculation because red is only present in red brown and checkered red? Wait, hold on\u2014wait, in our analysis, \"red\" refers to the pigment color. So checkered red would mean both genes are present (C_B_), while plain red would require only C present (C_bb), which isn't correct because if C is present but B is absent, it's plain brown, not red. Hmm, now I realize that my earlier understanding might be flawed. Because in the context, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So if a bird has C present (red) but B absent (plain), it's considered plain, regardless of the other gene. Similarly, if it has C present but B present, it's red brown. So the term \"red\" applies only when both C and B are present. Otherwise, it's plain red. So let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotypes and their conditions:\n\n1. Checkered brown: ccB_\n2. Plain brown: C_bb\n3. Red brown: C_B_\n4. Checkered plain: ccbb\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Red brown: C_B_ \u2192 9/16\n- Plain brown: C_bb \u2192 3/16\n- Checkered brown: ccB_ \u2192 3/16\n- Checkered plain: ccbb \u2192 1/16\n\nBut the options don't have 9:3:3:1. They do have option G: 12:2:2:0, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominant traits without accounting for the recessive ones. Wait, no\u2014it seems like the options provided are different. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let's recalculate:\n\nFor the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting. The probability of each genotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Homozygous dominant (C_C_): (3/4)^2 = 9/16\n- Heterozygous (C_c): 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16\n- Homozygous recessive (c_c): (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- Homozygous dominant (B_B_): 9/16\n- Heterozygous (B_b): 6/16\n- Homozygous recessive (b_b): 1/16\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products:\n\nRed brown (C_B_): 9/16 * 9/16 = 81/256? Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not how it works. Instead, each gene's probability multiplies. So the probability of having both C and B present is (9/16) * (9/16)? No, wait, no\u2014it's (probability C present) * (probability B present) = (9/16) * (9/16) = 81/256? Wait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing the approach. Actually, for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 for C and 3/4 for B. So the combined probability is (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16 for both being present (red brown).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of being plain brown (only C present) is (3/4 * 1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of being checkered brown (C absent, B present) is (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of being checkered plain (both C and B absent) is (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, but broken down into the four categories based on the presence of each gene.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which also doesn't match. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't fit either. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which is reversed. Option J is 2:6:2:6, which is similar to A. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is even more uniform. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems to match our calculation except that our breakdown was based on the presence of each gene, whereas the options group them differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the phenotypes grouped together instead of individually. So, according to our calculation:\n\n- Red brown: 9/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Checkered plain: 1/16\n\nIf we sum the checkered phenotypes: 3 + 1 = 4, and the others add up to 9 + 3 + 3 = 15. But none of the options directly reflect this grouping. Looking at the options, option F groups all into four categories equally, which would correspond to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't what we have. Option J groups checkered red (which is checkered brown) as 1 and plain red (which is plain brown) as 3, which adds up to 4. Option D groups checkered red (checkered brown) as 1, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, and plain brown as 1, totaling 8. Option G groups checkered red (checkered brown) as 12, which doesn't make sense. Option H has checkered red as 5, which is inconsistent. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation if we consider the presence of each gene separately, but the options group them differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that checkered red refers to having both genes active (C_B_), and checkered plain refers to ccbb. In that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered plain: 1/16\n- Plain red: 3/16 (from C_bb)\n- Red brown: 3/16 (from C_B_)\n\nBut this still doesn't match any option. Wait, perhaps the options are considering the total count rather than the fraction. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 totals 8. Our fractions add up to 16, so 1+3+3+1=8. But that's just the sum, not the actual counts. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically uses the counts, not the sum. So perhaps the options are scaled down by a factor of 16, making each category represent a count per 16. \n\nIn that case, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That fits our fractions where checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1, adding up to 16. So in terms of numbers, it's 9:3:3:1, but presented as 1:3:3:1 for each category. Wait, that doesn't quite line up. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled. Given that, I think option D is the closest match, but let me verify once more.\n\nWait, another way to see it: Each gene contributes a factor. For the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. This represents the proportion of each phenotype. So in terms of counts, it's 9, 3, 3, 1. But the options don't have 9:3:3:1 as a choice. Instead, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option H is 5:3:2:9, which is also different. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches if the options were presented with the correct scaling.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to match if each category is represented in the same proportion as 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but in reality, the checkered red and checkered brown refer to the presence of both genes, whereas checkered plain and plain red refer to the absence. So the correct ratio should be 9 (checkered red) : 3 (checkered brown) : 3 (plain red) : 1 (plain brown). Which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc) and absent is 1/4. However, the phenotypes aren't simply additive; they are multiplicative. So for example, if a bird is both C and B (C_B_), it would be red brown. If it's C and not B (C_bb), it would be plain brown. If it's not C but B (ccB_), it would be checkered brown. If neither C nor B (ccbb), then it would be checkered plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because the phenotype depends on the dominance. For the C gene: presence (C) leads to red, absence (c) leads to plain. Similarly, for B: presence (B) leads to brown, absence (b) leads to checkered. So the combined phenotype is:\n\n- C_B_: red brown\n- C_bb: plain brown\n- ccB_: checkered brown\n- ccbb: checkered plain\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each type based on the combination of the two genes. Each gene is inherited independently, so the total phenotypic ratio can be found by calculating the probabilities for each genotype and then determining the corresponding phenotype.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 chance of being absent (recessive).

Both genes present (C_B_):\n   Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n   Phenotype: red brown\n\n2. C present, B absent (C_bb):\n   Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n   Phenotype: plain brown\n\n3.

Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

Actually, for each gene, the probability of being present is 3/4 for C and 3/4 for B. So the combined probability is (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16 for both being present (red brown).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of being plain brown (only C present) is (3/4 * 1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of being checkered brown (C absent, B present) is (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of being checkered plain (both C and B absent) is (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, but broken down into the four categories based on the presence of each gene.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio?",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio? No, wait: if both genes are acting independently, the total phenotypic ratio would be (number of red) : (plain red) : (brown) : (checkered brown). Hmm, maybe better to calculate each phenotype separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible genotypes and then map them to phenotypes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes because Parent 1 is CC BB, so only CB, and Parent 2 is cc bb, so only cb. So all F2 will receive either CB or cb from each parent.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- From CB gamete + cb: CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- From cb gamete + CB: CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- From cb gamete + cb: cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: All have C (dominant) and B (dominant) alleles. So, they will express red pigment and appear checkered.\n- Checkered Brown: Have C (dominant) and B (dominant) alleles. They will have brown color and checkering.\n- Plain Brown: Have c (recessive) and b (recessive) alleles. Their pigment is brown, but without the checkering.\n- Plain Red: Impossible because the presence of C and B alleles leads to red pigment, while c and b do not. So all will either be red (if C is dominant) or plain (if c is dominant).\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of any dominant allele results in red pigment, regardless of the other gene. So, any bird with at least one dominant C or B allele will have red pigment, and those with at least one recessive c or b allele will have brown pigment. So, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. **Checkered Red**: Presence of C and B alleles (any dominant combination).\n2. **Checkered Brown**: Presence of C and B alleles, but expressed as brown due to B being dominant.\n3. **Plain Brown**: Presence of c and b alleles, leading to brown pigment.\n4. **Plain Red**: Impossible because C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. Unless... Wait, no\u2014if a bird has c alleles, they won't have red pigment, even if it's brown. So, the presence of C or B will determine red pigment, while the presence of c or b determines brown pigment. So the phenotypes are based on the combination of dominance for both genes.\n\nBut perhaps another way to look at it is: \n\nFor the C locus (Red/Plain):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red pigment\n- c \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus (Brown/Checkered):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b \u2192 Checkered\n\nSince both loci act independently, the phenotype will be a combination of these traits. So, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. **Red and Checkered**: If both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. **Red and Brown**: If C is dominant, but B is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. **Plain and Checkered**: If c is dominant, but B is recessive \u2192 Plain Checkered\n4. **Plain and Brown**: If neither C nor B are dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nEach of the four F2 genotypes (from above) corresponds to one phenotypic category. \n\nNumber of each:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC BB)**: 1/4 of the population \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered Brown (CcBb)**: 2/4 \u2192 50%\n- **Plain Brown (cc bb)**: 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- **Plain Red (none, since C is always dominant unless cc)** \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, I thought earlier that having any C allele leads to red pigment, regardless of B. But let me clarify. The presence of at least one dominant allele (either C or B) leads to red pigment. The presence of at least one recessive allele (both c and b) leads to brown pigment. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n\nPhenotype 2: Only C is present (so B can be present or not) \u2192 Checkered Brown (50%)\n\nPhenotype 3: Only B is present (so C can be present or not) \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B is present \u2192 Wait, but that's impossible because the presence of any dominant allele makes red pigment, and the presence of any recessive allele makes brown pigment. So all birds must have either red or brown pigment. Therefore, there shouldn't be a fourth category. But looking back, I think I made a mistake. Because:\n\nIf both C and B are recessive (cc bb), then the bird has both c and b, so it's Plain Brown. If only C is recessive (cc BB), it's Plain Red. If only B is recessive (Cc bb), it's Checkered Brown. If both are recessive (cc bb), it's Plain Brown. Wait, but that contradicts my previous statement. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of any dominant allele leads to red pigment, and any recessive leads to brown. So:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele exists, phenotype is red.\n- If at least one recessive allele exists, phenotype is brown.\n\nBut how does that split into four phenotypes?\n\nWait, perhaps the four phenotypes are based on the combination of both traits. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (C and B dominant)**\n2. **Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)**\n3. **Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)**\n4. **Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)**\n\nBecause:\n\n- If C is present, regardless of B, it's red.\n- If B is present, regardless of C, it's brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's neither, but since all birds have at least one of each (because if C were absent, B could still be present?), but no, actually, if C is absent, then B could be present (making brown) or absent (making plain). Similarly, if B is absent, C could be present (making red) or absent (making plain). So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nCalculating the proportion:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 25% (since both C and B are dominant)\n- **Checkered Brown**: 25% (only C dominant, B recessive)\n- **Plain Brown**: 25% (only B dominant, C recessive)\n- **Plain Red**: 25% (neither C nor B dominant)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, but according to the options given, none of them seem to match this exact breakdown. Let me review the answer choices:\n\nOptions:\n\nA.

Option Z: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16.\n\nWait, none of the options directly say 25% for each phenotype. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the F2 as 16 individuals instead of 25%, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes. Let me try again.\n\nIn F2, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of possible gametes. Each parent contributes CB or cb. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 16 if 16 birds, 4 would be 25% of 16?\nWait, but the options don't include fractions. Perhaps the question expects us to count the ratios without considering the absolute numbers, just the proportions. In that case, each phenotype would be represented 1 time out of 4, so 25% each. But looking at the options, none exactly match that except perhaps option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. But that sums to 16, which is less than 20. Alternatively, perhaps the options use different methods to represent ratios.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see: in F2, each of the four genotypes has a probability of 25%. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered Red (pheno A)\n- CcBb \u2192 50% \u2192 Checkered Brown (pheno B)\n- cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain Brown (pheno C)\n- Wait, where did I get 25% for Plain Red? That's impossible because any bird with at least one dominant allele will be red, regardless of the other gene. So, the fourth phenotype isn't applicable. Thus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (25%)\n2. Checkered Brown (50%)\n3. Plain Brown (25%)\n\nThis totals 100%.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have 25%, 50%, 25%, and nothing else. Wait, perhaps the question is counting the number of birds per phenotype rather than percentages. Let's assume there are 16 birds in total for simplicity.\n\n- 16 birds \u00d7 25% Checkered Red = 4\n- 16 \u00d7 50% Checkered Brown = 8\n- 16 \u00d7 25% Plain Brown = 4\n\nWhich adds up to 16, matching option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. But that doesn't account for the fact that Plain Brown includes both cases where B is dominant and where b is dominant. Wait, but the way I've broken it down, Checkered Brown is when only C is present, and Plain Brown is when only B is present. So, the numbers make sense: 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, 4 Plain Brown. Adding up to 16 birds.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option K is 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, which matches this scenario. But none of the options seem to reflect that. Wait, perhaps the question wants the actual numbers, like 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, 4 Plain Brown, and 0 Plain Red. But that's 16 birds, which fits option K. However, option K says 4,4,4,4, implying that Plain Red is zero, which isn't correct because some birds will have neither C nor B dominant.\n\nAh, I think I was wrong earlier. Because in reality, every bird will have at least one dominant allele (either C or B), making red pigment. So, the phenotype cannot be Plain Red. Instead, the only phenotypes are Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, and Plain Brown. Therefore, the correct pheno ratios are 25% each, but since we're likely dealing with 16 birds (as in many genetics problems), the counts would be 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, 4 Plain Brown. This adds up to 16, matching option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. But that implies Plain Red is zero, which isn't accurate because every bird will have at least one dominant trait.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question didn't consider the possibility of both recessives and intended to categorize based on whether each gene is present. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question and the options don't align perfectly with the calculations. Given the options, option K seems to fit the 25% each, but that might not be correct because all birds must have at least one dominant trait. Therefore, the correct pheno ratios should be 25% Checkered Red, 50% Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Brown, which would translate to 4,8,4,0 if there are 16 birds. But option K states 4,4,4,4, which suggests Plain Red is zero, which isn't true. Therefore, perhaps the correct choice isn't among the options, but given the options, option K is the closest, though it incorrectly assumes Plain Red is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, treating all as dominant. Let me try that approach. If both C and B are dominant, then all will be red. If either is recessive, then brown. But wait, that would mean all birds are red, which doesn't make sense because some would be brown. So, that approach isn't valid.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question treats each gene independently but combines the phenotypes differently. For example:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red.\n- If B is present, the bird is brown.\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n- If C is present and B is not present \u2192 Checkered Brown (50%)\n- If C is not present and B is present \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n- If C is not present and B is not present \u2192 Can't happen because at least one dominant is present.\n\nTherefore, the same as before: 25% Checkered Red, 50% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Brown. Which translates to 4,8,4,0 if there are 16 birds, but none of the options match this exactly. Option K is 4,4,4,4, which seems incorrect because it implies Plain Red is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the count based on all possible phenotypes, including those with both recessives, but that's impossible because all birds will have at least one dominant trait. Therefore, the correct pheno ratio is 25% Checkered Red, 50% Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Brown, which would correspond to 4,8,4,0 if there are 16 birds. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, assuming all 16 birds are accounted for, but that's incorrect because it ignores the fact that some birds would have neither C nor B dominant.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option K, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nLet me revisit the F2 generation. Each parent (CC BB x cc bb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So, F1 (CcBb) will produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. But since both parents are homozygous, the F1 should",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio? No, wait: if both genes are acting independently, the total phenotypic ratio would be (number of red) : (plain red) : (brown) : (checkered brown). Hmm, maybe better to calculate each phenotype separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible genotypes and then map them to phenotypes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes because Parent 1 is CC BB, so only CB, and Parent 2 is cc bb, so only cb. So all F2 will receive either CB or cb from each parent.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- From CB gamete + cb: CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- From cb gamete + CB: CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- From cb gamete + cb: cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: All have C (dominant) and B (dominant) alleles. So, they will express red pigment and appear checkered.\n- Checkered Brown: Have C (dominant) and B (dominant) alleles. They will have brown color and checkering.\n- Plain Brown: Have c (recessive) and b (recessive) alleles. Their pigment is brown, but without the checkering.\n- Plain Red: Impossible because the presence of C and B alleles leads to red pigment, while c and b do not. So all will either be red (if C is dominant) or plain (if c is dominant).\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of any dominant allele results in red pigment, regardless of the other gene. So, any bird with at least one dominant C or B allele will have red pigment, and those with at least one recessive c or b allele will have brown pigment. So, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. **Checkered Red**: Presence of C and B alleles (any dominant combination).\n2. **Checkered Brown**: Presence of C and B alleles, but expressed as brown due to B being dominant.\n3. **Plain Brown**: Presence of c and b alleles, leading to brown pigment.\n4. **Plain Red**: Impossible because C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. Unless... Wait, no\u2014if a bird has c alleles, they won't have red pigment, even if it's brown. So, the presence of C or B will determine red pigment, while the presence of c or b determines brown pigment. So the phenotypes are based on the combination of dominance for both genes.\n\nBut perhaps another way to look at it is: \n\nFor the C locus (Red/Plain):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red pigment\n- c \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus (Brown/Checkered):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b \u2192 Checkered\n\nSince both loci act independently, the phenotype will be a combination of these traits. So, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. **Red and Checkered**: If both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. **Red and Brown**: If C is dominant, but B is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. **Plain and Checkered**: If c is dominant, but B is recessive \u2192 Plain Checkered\n4. **Plain and Brown**: If neither C nor B are dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nEach of the four F2 genotypes (from above) corresponds to one phenotypic category. \n\nNumber of each:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC BB)**: 1/4 of the population \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered Brown (CcBb)**: 2/4 \u2192 50%\n- **Plain Brown (cc bb)**: 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- **Plain Red (none, since C is always dominant unless cc)** \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, I thought earlier that having any C allele leads to red pigment, regardless of B. But let me clarify. The presence of at least one dominant allele (either C or B) leads to red pigment. The presence of at least one recessive allele (both c and b) leads to brown pigment. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n\nPhenotype 2: Only C is present (so B can be present or not) \u2192 Checkered Brown (50%)\n\nPhenotype 3: Only B is present (so C can be present or not) \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B is present \u2192 Wait, but that's impossible because the presence of any dominant allele makes red pigment, and the presence of any recessive allele makes brown pigment. So all birds must have either red or brown pigment. Therefore, there shouldn't be a fourth category. But looking back, I think I made a mistake. Because:\n\nIf both C and B are recessive (cc bb), then the bird has both c and b, so it's Plain Brown. If only C is recessive (cc BB), it's Plain Red. If only B is recessive (Cc bb), it's Checkered Brown. If both are recessive (cc bb), it's Plain Brown. Wait, but that contradicts my previous statement. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of any dominant allele leads to red pigment, and any recessive leads to brown. So:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele exists, phenotype is red.\n- If at least one recessive allele exists, phenotype is brown.\n\nBut how does that split into four phenotypes?\n\nWait, perhaps the four phenotypes are based on the combination of both traits. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (C and B dominant)**\n2. **Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)**\n3. **Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)**\n4. **Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)**\n\nBecause:\n\n- If C is present, regardless of B, it's red.\n- If B is present, regardless of C, it's brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's neither, but since all birds have at least one of each (because if C were absent, B could still be present?), but no, actually, if C is absent, then B could be present (making brown) or absent (making plain). Similarly, if B is absent, C could be present (making red) or absent (making plain). So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nCalculating the proportion:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 25% (since both C and B are dominant)\n- **Checkered Brown**: 25% (only C dominant, B recessive)\n- **Plain Brown**: 25% (only B dominant, C recessive)\n- **Plain Red**: 25% (neither C nor B dominant)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, but according to the options given, none of them seem to match this exact breakdown. Let me review the answer choices:\n\nOptions:\n\nA.

Option Z: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16.\n\nWait, none of the options directly say 25% for each phenotype. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the F2 as 16 individuals instead of 25%, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes. Let me try again.\n\nIn F2, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of possible gametes. Each parent contributes CB or cb. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 16 if 16 birds, 4 would be 25% of 16?\nWait, but the options don't include fractions. Perhaps the question expects us to count the ratios without considering the absolute numbers, just the proportions. In that case, each phenotype would be represented 1 time out of 4, so 25% each. But looking at the options, none exactly match that except perhaps option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. But that sums to 16, which is less than 20. Alternatively, perhaps the options use different methods to represent ratios.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see: in F2, each of the four genotypes has a probability of 25%. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered Red (pheno A)\n- CcBb \u2192 50% \u2192 Checkered Brown (pheno B)\n- cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain Brown (pheno C)\n- Wait, where did I get 25% for Plain Red? That's impossible because any bird with at least one dominant allele will be red, regardless of the other gene. So, the fourth phenotype isn't applicable. Thus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (25%)\n2. Checkered Brown (50%)\n3. Plain Brown (25%)\n\nThis totals 100%.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have 25%, 50%, 25%, and nothing else. Wait, perhaps the question is counting the number of birds per phenotype rather than percentages. Let's assume there are 16 birds in total for simplicity.\n\n- 16 birds \u00d7 25% Checkered Red = 4\n- 16 \u00d7 50% Checkered Brown = 8\n- 16 \u00d7 25% Plain Brown = 4\n\nWhich adds up to 16, matching option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. But that doesn't account for the fact that Plain Brown includes both cases where B is dominant and where b is dominant. Wait, but the way I've broken it down, Checkered Brown is when only C is present, and Plain Brown is when only B is present. So, the numbers make sense: 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, 4 Plain Brown. Adding up to 16 birds.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option K is 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, which matches this scenario. But none of the options seem to reflect that. Wait, perhaps the question wants the actual numbers, like 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, 4 Plain Brown, and 0 Plain Red. But that's 16 birds, which fits option K. However, option K says 4,4,4,4, implying that Plain Red is zero, which isn't correct because some birds will have neither C nor B dominant.\n\nAh, I think I was wrong earlier. Because in reality, every bird will have at least one dominant allele (either C or B), making red pigment. So, the phenotype cannot be Plain Red. Instead, the only phenotypes are Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, and Plain Brown. Therefore, the correct pheno ratios are 25% each, but since we're likely dealing with 16 birds (as in many genetics problems), the counts would be 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, 4 Plain Brown. This adds up to 16, matching option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. But that implies Plain Red is zero, which isn't accurate because every bird will have at least one dominant trait.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question didn't consider the possibility of both recessives and intended to categorize based on whether each gene is present. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question and the options don't align perfectly with the calculations. Given the options, option K seems to fit the 25% each, but that might not be correct because all birds must have at least one dominant trait. Therefore, the correct pheno ratios should be 25% Checkered Red, 50% Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Brown, which would translate to 4,8,4,0 if there are 16 birds. But option K states 4,4,4,4, which suggests Plain Red is zero, which isn't true. Therefore, perhaps the correct choice isn't among the options, but given the options, option K is the closest, though it incorrectly assumes Plain Red is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, treating all as dominant. Let me try that approach. If both C and B are dominant, then all will be red. If either is recessive, then brown. But wait, that would mean all birds are red, which doesn't make sense because some would be brown. So, that approach isn't valid.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question treats each gene independently but combines the phenotypes differently. For example:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red.\n- If B is present, the bird is brown.\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n- If C is present and B is not present \u2192 Checkered Brown (50%)\n- If C is not present and B is present \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n- If C is not present and B is not present \u2192 Can't happen because at least one dominant is present.\n\nTherefore, the same as before: 25% Checkered Red, 50% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Brown. Which translates to 4,8,4,0 if there are 16 birds, but none of the options match this exactly. Option K is 4,4,4,4, which seems incorrect because it implies Plain Red is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the count based on all possible phenotypes, including those with both recessives, but that's impossible because all birds will have at least one dominant trait. Therefore, the correct pheno ratio is 25% Checkered Red, 50% Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Brown, which would correspond to 4,8,4,0 if there are 16 birds. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, assuming all 16 birds are accounted for, but that's incorrect because it ignores the fact that some birds would have neither C nor B dominant.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option K, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nLet me revisit the F2 generation. Each parent (CC BB x cc bb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So, F1 (CcBb) will produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. But since both parents are homozygous, the F1 should",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So, each gene has two phenotypic categories.",
    "rollout": " So, each gene has two phenotypic categories. Therefore, the total number of phenotypic classes would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. However, some phenotypes might combine due to dominance interactions.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the C gene: \n- Presence (C): 3/4 (since in a dihybrid cross, each gamete contributes either C or c, and the F2 shows a 3:1 ratio)\n- Absence (c): 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for one phenotype category, then (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for another, and so on. Wait, no\u2014it's actually the sum of products for each combination. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Phenotype | B Phenotype | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (CC BB) | Yes | Yes | (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nCheckered Brown (CcBb) | No | Yes | (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nRed Checkered (CC bb) | Yes | No | (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPlain Brown (Ccbb) | No | No | (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Red Brown, Checkered Brown, Red Checkered, and Plain Brown respectively. But the options given don't seem to include this directly. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions A through H provide different ratios. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems like a different approach where each gene's effect combines differently. Maybe the user made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes, or perhaps I misunderstood the genes' roles.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check: Gene C determines pigment color, with C being dominant (red) and c being recessive (plain). Gene B determines color, with B dominant (brown) and b recessive (checkered). So, a bird would express the phenotype based on both genes.\n\nLet me consider the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, any presence of C or B will result in the respective phenotype. But if both genes are recessive, it's plain brown. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC BB: Red Brown\n- 25% CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- 25% CC bb: Plain Brown\n- 25% cc BB: Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25% (from CC bb and cc bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 50% (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our analysis, checkered brown is 50%, while option C's checkered brown is 3/16. That suggests I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the genes. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. If C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, then a bird could have both C and B (Red Brown), C and b (Red Checkered), c and B (Checkered Brown), or c and b (Plain Brown). Now, the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown (any C or B)\n- Red Checkered (only C, B, or B)\n- Checkered Brown (only c, B)\n- Plain Brown (only c, b)\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant allele for C or B will have the corresponding phenotype.\n- Only if both are recessive (c and b) does it become Plain Brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: only when both are recessive (c and b)\n- Plain Brown: only when both are recessive (c and b)\n- Red Brown: when at least one allele is dominant (either C or B)\n- Red Checkered: when C is dominant, and B is recessive\n\nWait, no\u2014because both genes can be dominant or recessive. Let me create a table:\n\nEach bird can be represented as (gene C, gene B):\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. (C, B) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. (C, b) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. (c, B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. (c, b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio. So:\n\nFor gene C: 3/4 have C (Red), 1/4 have c (Plain).\nFor gene B: 3/4 have B (Brown), 1/4 have b (Checkered).\n\nAssuming independence, the overall phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (c, b) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Plain Brown: (c, b) same as above \u2192 1/16\n- Red Brown: any other combination except (c, b) \u2192 (1 - 1/16) = 15/16\n- Red Checkered: only (C, b) \u2192 3/16\n\nWait, but 3/16 is approximately 0.1875, which is less than 1/16. That seems off because the other phenotype (Checkered Brown) is 1/16 each, totaling 2/16. So the remaining would be 14/16, which would split into Red Brown and Red Checkered. Wait, no\u2014if (C, B) is 9/16, (C, b) is 3/16, (c, B) is 3/16, and (c, b) is 1/16. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16, correct.\n\nSo the actual counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 1/16 ( Plain Brown)\n- Checkered Brown: another 1/16 (but that's redundant; better to say there are 2 of them)\nWait, no. Each combination has a certain count. For example, if the F2 has 16 individuals, then:\n\n- 9 are (C, B) \u2192 Red Brown\n- 3 are (C, b) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- 3 are (c, B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1 is (c, b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but in the options, \"checkered red\" refers to the phenotype where the bird is checkered but red, which corresponds to (c, B) \u2192 Checkered Brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So, each gene has two phenotypic categories. Therefore, the total number of phenotypic classes would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. However, some phenotypes might combine due to dominance interactions.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the C gene: \n- Presence (C): 3/4 (since in a dihybrid cross, each gamete contributes either C or c, and the F2 shows a 3:1 ratio)\n- Absence (c): 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for one phenotype category, then (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for another, and so on. Wait, no\u2014it's actually the sum of products for each combination. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Phenotype | B Phenotype | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (CC BB) | Yes | Yes | (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nCheckered Brown (CcBb) | No | Yes | (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nRed Checkered (CC bb) | Yes | No | (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPlain Brown (Ccbb) | No | No | (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Red Brown, Checkered Brown, Red Checkered, and Plain Brown respectively. But the options given don't seem to include this directly. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions A through H provide different ratios. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems like a different approach where each gene's effect combines differently. Maybe the user made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes, or perhaps I misunderstood the genes' roles.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check: Gene C determines pigment color, with C being dominant (red) and c being recessive (plain). Gene B determines color, with B dominant (brown) and b recessive (checkered). So, a bird would express the phenotype based on both genes.\n\nLet me consider the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, any presence of C or B will result in the respective phenotype. But if both genes are recessive, it's plain brown. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC BB: Red Brown\n- 25% CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- 25% CC bb: Plain Brown\n- 25% cc BB: Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25% (from CC bb and cc bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 50% (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our analysis, checkered brown is 50%, while option C's checkered brown is 3/16. That suggests I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the genes. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. If C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, then a bird could have both C and B (Red Brown), C and b (Red Checkered), c and B (Checkered Brown), or c and b (Plain Brown). Now, the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown (any C or B)\n- Red Checkered (only C, B, or B)\n- Checkered Brown (only c, B)\n- Plain Brown (only c, b)\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant allele for C or B will have the corresponding phenotype.\n- Only if both are recessive (c and b) does it become Plain Brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: only when both are recessive (c and b)\n- Plain Brown: only when both are recessive (c and b)\n- Red Brown: when at least one allele is dominant (either C or B)\n- Red Checkered: when C is dominant, and B is recessive\n\nWait, no\u2014because both genes can be dominant or recessive. Let me create a table:\n\nEach bird can be represented as (gene C, gene B):\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. (C, B) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. (C, b) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. (c, B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. (c, b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio. So:\n\nFor gene C: 3/4 have C (Red), 1/4 have c (Plain).\nFor gene B: 3/4 have B (Brown), 1/4 have b (Checkered).\n\nAssuming independence, the overall phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (c, b) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Plain Brown: (c, b) same as above \u2192 1/16\n- Red Brown: any other combination except (c, b) \u2192 (1 - 1/16) = 15/16\n- Red Checkered: only (C, b) \u2192 3/16\n\nWait, but 3/16 is approximately 0.1875, which is less than 1/16. That seems off because the other phenotype (Checkered Brown) is 1/16 each, totaling 2/16. So the remaining would be 14/16, which would split into Red Brown and Red Checkered. Wait, no\u2014if (C, B) is 9/16, (C, b) is 3/16, (c, B) is 3/16, and (c, b) is 1/16. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16, correct.\n\nSo the actual counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 1/16 ( Plain Brown)\n- Checkered Brown: another 1/16 (but that's redundant; better to say there are 2 of them)\nWait, no. Each combination has a certain count. For example, if the F2 has 16 individuals, then:\n\n- 9 are (C, B) \u2192 Red Brown\n- 3 are (C, b) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- 3 are (c, B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1 is (c, b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but in the options, \"checkered red\" refers to the phenotype where the bird is checkered but red, which corresponds to (c, B) \u2192 Checkered Brown. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" is (c, b) \u2192 Plain Brown. \"Red brown\" is (C, B) \u2192 Red Brown, and \"red checkered\" is (C, b) \u2192 Red Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C says:\n\ncheckered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that aligns with what I've calculated. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me approach this differently. Each gene contributes to the phenotype. The F2 will have a certain number of individuals categorized into the four main phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, the standard way is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the independent assortment of two genes. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio under complete dominance is 3:1 (dominant : recessive). Since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9/16: Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- 3/16: Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- 3/16: Plain Brown (C recessive, B recessive)\n- 1/16: Plain Red (both recessive)\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014that\u2019s if each gene segregates independently. Let me confirm. The Punnett square for a dihybrid cross (two loci) with independent assortment would indeed yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So applying that:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9 parts\n- Checkered Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Red: 1 part\n\nNow, the total is 16 parts. So the ratio simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut let me make sure. The F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which itself was F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 is CcBb, so when selfed, each gene segregates independently. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each genotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of being CC (for pigment) and BB (for color) is 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: CC BB \u2192 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% (Checkered Red)\n2. Checkered Brown: CC Bb \u2192 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%\n3. Plain Brown: Cc BB \u2192 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%\n4. Plain Red: cc bb \u2192 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo adding them up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 37.5%, which makes sense because 37.5% \u00d7 16 = 6.25, 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150, and 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150, totaling 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150, which is 16 \u00d7 9.375, but wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the percentages.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to express the ratios directly without percentages. The 9:3:3:1 ratio corresponds to the fractions:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNope, that's not matching.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nStill not matching.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2014 that's 9+3+3+1=16, but scaled down by dividing each by 16, giving 9/16 \u2248 0.5625, etc.\n\nWait, the options don't seem to match exactly, but looking at the choices, Option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which isn't 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are simplified ratios, not actual counts. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the inheritance.\n\nWait another thought: Perhaps the letters are mixed. Let me double-check the genes.\n\nThe question states:\n\n- C: pigment (dominant = red, recessive = plain)\n- B: color (dominant = brown, recessive = checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Plain Red\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the four categories.\n\nBut none of the options perfectly match that. Looking at option G: 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align with the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but 1:3:9:3 is different from 9:3:3:1.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio if we consider dominance. However, since the F2 is the result of independent assortment, the overall ratio combines both genes. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both dominant alleles present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb: c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but that seems off because in reality, the B locus also affects color. Let me approach this differently. Each gene contributes to the phenotype. The F2 will have a certain number of individuals categorized into the four main phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, the standard way is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the independent assortment of two genes. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio under complete dominance is 3:1 (dominant : recessive). Since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9/16: Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- 3/16: Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- 3/16: Plain Brown (C recessive, B recessive)\n- 1/16: Plain Red (both recessive)\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014that\u2019s if each gene segregates independently. Let me confirm. The Punnett square for a dihybrid cross (two loci) with independent assortment would indeed yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So applying that:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9 parts\n- Checkered Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Red: 1 part\n\nNow, the total is 16 parts. So the ratio simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut let me make sure. The F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which itself was F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 is CcBb, so when selfed, each gene segregates independently. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each genotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of being CC (for pigment) and BB (for color) is 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: CC BB \u2192 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% (Checkered Red)\n2. Checkered Brown: CC Bb \u2192 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%\n3. Plain Brown: Cc BB \u2192 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%\n4. Plain Red: cc bb \u2192 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo adding them up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 37.5%, which makes sense because 37.5% \u00d7 16 = 6.25, 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150, and 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150, totaling 37.5 \u00d7 4 = 150, which is 16 \u00d7 9.375, but wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the percentages.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to express the ratios directly without percentages. The 9:3:3:1 ratio corresponds to the fractions:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNope, that's not matching.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nStill not matching.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2014 that's 9+3+3+1=16, but scaled down by dividing each by 16, giving 9/16 \u2248 0.5625, etc.\n\nWait, the options don't seem to match exactly, but looking at the choices, Option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which isn't 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are simplified ratios, not actual counts. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the inheritance.\n\nWait another thought: Perhaps the letters are mixed. Let me double-check the genes.\n\nThe question states:\n\n- C: pigment (dominant = red, recessive = plain)\n- B: color (dominant = brown, recessive = checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Plain Red\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the four categories.\n\nBut none of the options perfectly match that. Looking at option G: 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align with the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but 1:3:9:3 is different from 9:3:3:1. Not matching.\n\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio! Because 9+3+3+1=16, and each category represents the proportion of each phenotype. So option C's ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain brown, 1 plain red.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, option C is labeled as \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

C dominant, B recessive: C_bb \u2192 red checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both recessive: cc_bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, how many of each in the F2?\n\nSince each gene follows a 3:1 ratio, the total number is 4^n where n=2, so 16 possible phenotypes. But calculating the actual counts:\n\nFor the C locus: 3 (presence) : 1 (absence)\nFor the B locus: 3 : 1\n\nThe combined ratio is 3\u00d73 = 9 parts for presence and 3\u00d71=3 parts for absence, but wait, actually, it's 3^2 = 9 for each possible combination. Alternatively, the actual count is:\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- cc_B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypes, it's:\n\n- Checkered red (cc_B_) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain red (cc_bb) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown (C_bb) \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown (C_B_) \u2192 9 parts\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this 1:1:3:9 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the F2 from a dihybrid cross (assuming each gene is independent) would indeed follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options provided don't seem to include this exact breakdown. Instead, some options combine the checkered and plain into different categories, like \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" which might not align with the standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the presence of both dominant traits versus just one. But according to standard classification, each trait is considered separately. So, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes: C_B_, C_bb, cc_B_, cc_bb.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2013 sum to 16, but not matching.\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2013 sum to 16, but doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\nOption C:12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18, but still doesn't fit.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16. This seems off because 1+3+9+3=16, but the order is different.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16. Again, same issue.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 all 4, sum to 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16.\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16.\n\nNone of the options exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the phenotypes are being counted. Maybe the question is considering the dominance hierarchy differently or perhaps combining certain phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to group checkered and plain into separate categories, but that would change the analysis.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each gene separately and then see if any options aggregate them. For example, \"checkered\" could refer to either C or c, regardless of B. Similarly, \"plain\" could be c or C. But that interpretation would lead to:\n\n- Checkered: any C (regardless of B)\n- Plain: any c (regardless of B)\n\nThen, the B locus would determine whether it's brown or checkered within the checkered category, and brown within the plain category.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), then they are checkered.\n- If C is recessive (c_), then they are plain.\n\nWithin the checkered category, if B is dominant (B_), they are brown.\nIf B is recessive (b_), they are checkered.\n\nSimilarly, within the plain category, if B is dominant (B_), they are brown.\nIf B is recessive (b_), they are plain.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes become:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc_bb \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nAnd the counts would be:\n\nC_B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nC_bb: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\ncc_B_: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\ncc_bb: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly correspond to this. Option F says checkered red 4, plain red 4, etc.\u2014but that doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the original question misclassifies the phenotypes.\n\nAnother possibility: The question may be considering \"checkered\" as simply the presence of one dominant allele, without considering the effect on color. In that case, the phenotypic classes would be based solely on dominance, ignoring the effect on color. That would mean:\n\n- C_: Checkered (regardless of B)\n- c_: Plain (regardless of B)\n\nThen, the B locus would determine the color within each group.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc_bb \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWhich again leads to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the answer options match this, perhaps I've misunderstood the question's phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for the ratio of the presence of both dominant traits versus others, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio combines checkered and plain based on the dominant traits. For instance, individuals who are at least checkered (i.e., have at least one dominant allele) would fall under checkered phenotype, and those with at most checkered would be plain. But that interpretation ignores the color effect, which complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the color effect and just look at the presence of dominant alleles, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but presented as option F. However, option F states checkered red 4, plain red 4, checkered brown 4, plain brown 4, which sums to 16 but doesn't reflect the 9:3:3:1 distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the presence of the dominant allele for pigment, irrespective of the color. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be based purely on the presence of dominant pigment, ignoring color. In that case, each gene contributes a 3:1 ratio, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But again, none of the options match this except possibly option F, though it's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only the presence of the dominant allele for pigment (so 3:1 ratio per gene) and ignoring the color effect. So, the phenotypic ratio would be based on pigment presence: 3:1, but since it's two genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. Still, the options don't align perfectly.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option F is checkered red 4, plain red 4, checkered brown 4, plain brown 4. That suggests a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which isn't correct unless all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case in a dihybrid cross with independent loci.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question is expecting a simplified approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the actual counts in F2. From earlier, F2 would have 16 individuals (since each parent produces 4 gametes, 4x4=16).\n\nIn reality, the F2 would have:\n\n- 9 checkered brown (C_B_)\n- 3 checkered plain (C_bb)\n- 3 plain brown (cc_B_)\n- 1 plain plain (cc_bb)\n\nSumming to 16. None of the options exactly match this, but perhaps the closest is option F, which groups checkered and plain together, resulting in four categories each with 4, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to present the F2 ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the total, but the options are presented in a specific way. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly formulated, and the intended ratio was 9:3:3:1, but presented as option F. However, the options do not explicitly mention 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know the ratio of checkered to plain, ignoring color. In that case, the checkered phenotype includes both C_B_ and cc_B_, totaling 12, while plain includes C_bb and cc_bb, totaling 2. So the ratio would be 12:2, simplifying to 6:1. But this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of pigment, treating C and B as dominant, leading to a 3:1 ratio per gene, hence a 9:3:3:1 overall. But again, none of the options match this precisely.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option F presents a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which is incorrect for a dihybrid cross with independent loci. Therefore, perhaps the best fit is option F, even though it's not technically accurate, but it's the only one that groups checkered and plain into two categories each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the phenotypic ratio based on the number of dominant vs recessive alleles, leading to a 3:1 ratio per gene, but again, it doesn't align with the given options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option F when grouped appropriately. Even though option F presents four categories each with four, perhaps the intention was to group checkered and plain, making the checkered phenotype 12 (9+3) and plain phenotype 2 (1). But option F does not reflect this grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of dihybrid crosses and the resulting phenotypic ratios, and the correct answer is option F, despite it not strictly following the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the user is confusing the F1 with F2. The F1 in this scenario would be CcBb, and its gametes would produce Cc and Bb, leading to F2 as CB, cb, cB, cb. But this is not necessary for solving the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing, the correct F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. However, option F groups the checkered and plain phenotypes, suggesting that the checkered phenotype consists of both dominant and recessive alleles, which isn't entirely accurate. Therefore, perhaps the closest answer is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for presence to absence. So the combined phenotype would be determined by both genes. To get the phenotypic ratio, we calculate the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C_bb \u2192 red checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both recessive: cc_bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, how many of each in the F2?\n\nSince each gene follows a 3:1 ratio, the total number is 4^n where n=2, so 16 possible phenotypes. But calculating the actual counts:\n\nFor the C locus: 3 (presence) : 1 (absence)\nFor the B locus: 3 : 1\n\nThe combined ratio is 3\u00d73 = 9 parts for presence and 3\u00d71=3 parts for absence, but wait, actually, it's 3^2 = 9 for each possible combination. Alternatively, the actual count is:\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- cc_B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypes, it's:\n\n- Checkered red (cc_B_) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain red (cc_bb) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown (C_bb) \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown (C_B_) \u2192 9 parts\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this 1:1:3:9 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the F2 from a dihybrid cross (assuming each gene is independent) would indeed follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options provided don't seem to include this exact breakdown. Instead, some options combine the checkered and plain into different categories, like \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" which might not align with the standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the presence of both dominant traits versus just one. But according to standard classification, each trait is considered separately. So, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes: C_B_, C_bb, cc_B_, cc_bb.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2013 sum to 16, but not matching.\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2013 sum to 16, but doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\nOption C:12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18, but still doesn't fit.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16. This seems off because 1+3+9+3=16, but the order is different.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16. Again, same issue.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 all 4, sum to 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16.\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16.\n\nNone of the options exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the phenotypes are being counted. Maybe the question is considering the dominance hierarchy differently or perhaps combining certain phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to group checkered and plain into separate categories, but that would change the analysis.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each gene separately and then see if any options aggregate them. For example, \"checkered\" could refer to either C or c, regardless of B. Similarly, \"plain\" could be c or C. But that interpretation would lead to:\n\n- Checkered: any C (regardless of B)\n- Plain: any c (regardless of B)\n\nThen, the B locus would determine whether it's brown or checkered within the checkered category, and brown within the plain category.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), then they are checkered.\n- If C is recessive (c_), then they are plain.\n\nWithin the checkered category, if B is dominant (B_), they are brown.\nIf B is recessive (b_), they are checkered.\n\nSimilarly, within the plain category, if B is dominant (B_), they are brown.\nIf B is recessive (b_), they are plain.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes become:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc_bb \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nAnd the counts would be:\n\nC_B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nC_bb: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\ncc_B_: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\ncc_bb: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly correspond to this. Option F says checkered red 4, plain red 4, etc.\u2014but that doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the original question misclassifies the phenotypes.\n\nAnother possibility: The question may be considering \"checkered\" as simply the presence of one dominant allele, without considering the effect on color. In that case, the phenotypic classes would be based solely on dominance, ignoring the effect on color. That would mean:\n\n- C_: Checkered (regardless of B)\n- c_: Plain (regardless of B)\n\nThen, the B locus would determine the color within each group.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc_bb \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWhich again leads to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the answer options match this, perhaps I've misunderstood the question's phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for the ratio of the presence of both dominant traits versus others, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio combines checkered and plain based on the dominant traits. For instance, individuals who are at least checkered (i.e., have at least one dominant allele) would fall under checkered phenotype, and those with at most checkered would be plain. But that interpretation ignores the color effect, which complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the color effect and just look at the presence of dominant alleles, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but presented as option F. However, option F states checkered red 4, plain red 4, checkered brown 4, plain brown 4, which sums to 16 but doesn't reflect the 9:3:3:1 distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the presence of the dominant allele for pigment, irrespective of the color. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be based purely on the presence of dominant pigment, ignoring color. In that case, each gene contributes a 3:1 ratio, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But again, none of the options match this except possibly option F, though it's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only the presence of the dominant allele for pigment (so 3:1 ratio per gene) and ignoring the color effect. So, the phenotypic ratio would be based on pigment presence: 3:1, but since it's two genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. Still, the options don't align perfectly.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option F is checkered red 4, plain red 4, checkered brown 4, plain brown 4. That suggests a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which isn't correct unless all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case in a dihybrid cross with independent loci.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question is expecting a simplified approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the actual counts in F2. From earlier, F2 would have 16 individuals (since each parent produces 4 gametes, 4x4=16).\n\nIn reality, the F2 would have:\n\n- 9 checkered brown (C_B_)\n- 3 checkered plain (C_bb)\n- 3 plain brown (cc_B_)\n- 1 plain plain (cc_bb)\n\nSumming to 16. None of the options exactly match this, but perhaps the closest is option F, which groups checkered and plain together, resulting in four categories each with 4, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to present the F2 ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the total, but the options are presented in a specific way. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly formulated, and the intended ratio was 9:3:3:1, but presented as option F. However, the options do not explicitly mention 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know the ratio of checkered to plain, ignoring color. In that case, the checkered phenotype includes both C_B_ and cc_B_, totaling 12, while plain includes C_bb and cc_bb, totaling 2. So the ratio would be 12:2, simplifying to 6:1. But this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of pigment, treating C and B as dominant, leading to a 3:1 ratio per gene, hence a 9:3:3:1 overall. But again, none of the options match this precisely.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option F presents a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which is incorrect for a dihybrid cross with independent loci. Therefore, perhaps the best fit is option F, even though it's not technically accurate, but it's the only one that groups checkered and plain into two categories each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the phenotypic ratio based on the number of dominant vs recessive alleles, leading to a 3:1 ratio per gene, but again, it doesn't align with the given options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option F when grouped appropriately. Even though option F presents four categories each with four, perhaps the intention was to group checkered and plain, making the checkered phenotype 12 (9+3) and plain phenotype 2 (1). But option F does not reflect this grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of dihybrid crosses and the resulting phenotypic ratios, and the correct answer is option F, despite it not strictly following the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the user is confusing the F1 with F2. The F1 in this scenario would be CcBb, and its gametes would produce Cc and Bb, leading to F2 as CB, cb, cB, cb. But this is not necessary for solving the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing, the correct F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. However, option F groups the checkered and plain phenotypes, suggesting that the checkered phenotype consists of both dominant and recessive alleles, which isn't entirely accurate. Therefore, perhaps the closest answer is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

    "rollout": " So each gene has two alleles, leading to three phenotypic categories per gene. But since the genes are linked, the phenotypic ratios might differ, but the question doesn't specify linkage, so we'll assume independence. Thus, the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (red): 3/4 (since recessive c is 1/4)\n- Absence (plain): 1/4\n\nFor color (B):\n- Presence (brown): 3/4\n- Absence (checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratios are:\n\n- Both present (red and brown): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Pigment present, color absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Pigment absent, color present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both absent (plain and checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, but the user's options don't include such exact fractions, but instead use counts like \"6, 2\" etc. So perhaps we need to calculate based on actual numbers. Alternatively, if the F2 generation is calculated using the dihybrid cross formula without considering specific probabilities, but given the options, we can proceed by calculating the expected phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 phenotypes, but the question specifies F2. Let me double-check the initial part: The question says, \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Wait, hold on\u2014it was a typo in my initial thought process. The user wrote: \"...phenotypic ratio...\" and then listed several options. But upon re-examining, the initial instruction was correct: complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the cross is between CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing. As per standard dihybrid crosses, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but here, considering dominance, the phenotypes would be red-brown (dominant for both), plain-brown (recessive for pigment, dominant for color), plain-red (recessive for pigment, recessive for color), and checkered (recessive for both).\n\nWait, but according to the initial analysis, the phenotypic ratio for F2 would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options:\n\nOptions A through H list various ratios like 6,2, etc. Perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead, but the user clearly stated F2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 genotypes would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly, for B, it's BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, the F2 phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. For pigment (C):\n\n- C present: red\n- c absent: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B present: brown\n- b absent: checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: red-brown\n2. Pigment dominant, color absent: red-checkered\n3. Pigment absent, color dominant: plain-brown\n4. Both absent: plain-checkered\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would be based on how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. Given the Mendelian probabilities, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1. Translating this into counts based on 16 total F2 individuals: 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. But looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 plain, checkered, red, brown. That seems off. Option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 way too high. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 similar to D but reversed. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 same as D but ordered differently. So none match exactly. Maybe I need to consider the question's intention. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant F1, but the instructions were unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to determine the correct F2 phenotypic ratio based on the described cross. If the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would have the following genotypes: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For B, similarly: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Combining these, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc_bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- C_B_: (25% CC) * (25% BB) = 6.25%\n- C_bb: (25% CC) * (50% Bb) = 12.5%\n- cc_B_: (25% cc) * (25% BB) = 6.25%\n- cc_bb: (25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5%\n\nAdding up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%, which doesn't add up. Wait, that suggests I'm miscalculating. Actually, the correct approach is to compute the probabilities separately for each gene and combine them.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Probability of C (C_): 3/4\n- Probability of c (cc): 1/4\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (B_): 3/4\n- Probability of b (bb): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_ and bb \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- cc and B_ \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- cc and bb \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, where:\n\n- 9 parts: red-brown\n- 3 parts: red-checkered\n- 3 parts: plain-brown\n- 1 part: plain-checkered\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none directly match this. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 plain, checkered, red, brown. That's reversed. Option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 not matching. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 matches except for order. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching. Option B: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Close, but not exact. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as B.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misaligned. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 phenotypic ratio rather than F2. Let me recast the entire problem accordingly.\n\nIf the cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb), the F1 would be CcBb. The F1 would exhibit the traits of being C (dominant) and B (dominant), resulting in red and brown. All F1 would be red-brown. Since there's only one possibility for F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% red-brown, which isn't among the options. Hence, probably the question refers to F2.\n\nAssuming the correct F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps the options are scaled or presented differently. Looking at option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, that matches. It lists 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. So option C seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two alleles, leading to three phenotypic categories per gene. But since the genes are linked, the phenotypic ratios might differ, but the question doesn't specify linkage, so we'll assume independence. Thus, the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (red): 3/4 (since recessive c is 1/4)\n- Absence (plain): 1/4\n\nFor color (B):\n- Presence (brown): 3/4\n- Absence (checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratios are:\n\n- Both present (red and brown): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Pigment present, color absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Pigment absent, color present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both absent (plain and checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, but the user's options don't include such exact fractions, but instead use counts like \"6, 2\" etc. So perhaps we need to calculate based on actual numbers. Alternatively, if the F2 generation is calculated using the dihybrid cross formula without considering specific probabilities, but given the options, we can proceed by calculating the expected phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 phenotypes, but the question specifies F2. Let me double-check the initial part: The question says, \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Wait, hold on\u2014it was a typo in my initial thought process. The user wrote: \"...phenotypic ratio...\" and then listed several options. But upon re-examining, the initial instruction was correct: complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the cross is between CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing. As per standard dihybrid crosses, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but here, considering dominance, the phenotypes would be red-brown (dominant for both), plain-brown (recessive for pigment, dominant for color), plain-red (recessive for pigment, recessive for color), and checkered (recessive for both).\n\nWait, but according to the initial analysis, the phenotypic ratio for F2 would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options:\n\nOptions A through H list various ratios like 6,2, etc. Perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead, but the user clearly stated F2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 genotypes would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly, for B, it's BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, the F2 phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. For pigment (C):\n\n- C present: red\n- c absent: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B present: brown\n- b absent: checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: red-brown\n2. Pigment dominant, color absent: red-checkered\n3. Pigment absent, color dominant: plain-brown\n4. Both absent: plain-checkered\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would be based on how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. Given the Mendelian probabilities, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1. Translating this into counts based on 16 total F2 individuals: 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. But looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 plain, checkered, red, brown. That seems off. Option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 way too high. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 similar to D but reversed. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 same as D but ordered differently. So none match exactly. Maybe I need to consider the question's intention. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant F1, but the instructions were unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to determine the correct F2 phenotypic ratio based on the described cross. If the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would have the following genotypes: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For B, similarly: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Combining these, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc_bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- C_B_: (25% CC) * (25% BB) = 6.25%\n- C_bb: (25% CC) * (50% Bb) = 12.5%\n- cc_B_: (25% cc) * (25% BB) = 6.25%\n- cc_bb: (25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5%\n\nAdding up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%, which doesn't add up. Wait, that suggests I'm miscalculating. Actually, the correct approach is to compute the probabilities separately for each gene and combine them.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Probability of C (C_): 3/4\n- Probability of c (cc): 1/4\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (B_): 3/4\n- Probability of b (bb): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_ and bb \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- cc and B_ \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- cc and bb \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, where:\n\n- 9 parts: red-brown\n- 3 parts: red-checkered\n- 3 parts: plain-brown\n- 1 part: plain-checkered\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none directly match this. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 plain, checkered, red, brown. That's reversed. Option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 not matching. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 matches except for order. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching. Option B: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Close, but not exact. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as B.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misaligned. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 phenotypic ratio rather than F2. Let me recast the entire problem accordingly.\n\nIf the cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb), the F1 would be CcBb. The F1 would exhibit the traits of being C (dominant) and B (dominant), resulting in red and brown. All F1 would be red-brown. Since there's only one possibility for F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% red-brown, which isn't among the options. Hence, probably the question refers to F2.\n\nAssuming the correct F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps the options are scaled or presented differently. Looking at option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, that matches. It lists 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. So option C seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming that dominance is expressed regardless of the other gene, except that if both genes are present, the phenotype might change.",
    "rollout": " Assuming that dominance is expressed regardless of the other gene, except that if both genes are present, the phenotype might change. But typically, dihybrids combine both traits. However, in this case, since each gene is controlled separately, the phenotypes are additive.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the F1 cross. Let me proceed methodically:\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each gene in F2:\n\nFor Gene C (C and c):\n- CC (dominant, red)\n- Cc (dominant, red)\n- cc (recessive, plain)\n\nFor Gene B (B and b):\n- BB (dominant, brown)\n- Bb (dominant, brown)\n- bb (recessive, checkered)\n\nThe combination of these two genes leads to different phenotypes. The phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other gene unless there's some interaction. However, in most cases, the dominance applies across both genes. But without specific information about interaction effects, we'll assume that the presence of any dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. \n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (since B is recessive and b is dominant)\n2. Plain (since c is recessive and C is dominant)\n3. Brown (since B is dominant and B is present)\n4. Red (since C is dominant and C is present)\n\nBut wait, how do these interact? If a bird is checkered (b) and has the B allele (B), it would still be brown. Similarly, if it's plain (C is recessive) and has B, it would be brown. Only when both genes are recessive (c and b) would it be plain. Also, if both genes are dominant (C and B), it would be red. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene is separate, so the presence of a dominant allele for either gene leads to the respective phenotype, ignoring the other gene. Wait, that's not correct either. In reality, both genes must be present for a particular phenotype, but sometimes there's an interaction where one gene masks the other. However, the problem statement doesn't mention such interactions, so I'll proceed under the assumption that each gene acts independently, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but combined together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotype depends on whether any gene is present. Let me try another approach. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both genes dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red\n2. CC Bb: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 red\n3. CC bb: C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 red\n4. Cc BB: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb: C and B dominant \u2192 red\n6. Cc bb: C dominant (red), b recessive \u2192 red\n7. cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 brown\n8. cc Bb: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 brown\n9. cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but according to this, all red phenotypes would include all cases where at least one dominant allele is present, except when both are recessive, leading to checkered. Alternatively, perhaps checkered is the phenotype when both genes are recessive, and brown is when B is present (regardless of C), and red is when C is present (regardless of B). Hmm, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me look back at the options given. The answer choices suggest various ratios, so perhaps I should calculate the expected number of each phenotype based on the Punnett square.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypic ratios are 1/16 for each of the four possible combinations (as per the earlier analysis), but since each gene is independent, the overall phenotypic ratio would be determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene. However, the actual phenotypes depend on whether any dominant allele is present for each gene.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the phenotypic ratios directly. Let's consider all possible genotypic combinations and map them to their phenotypes:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Red\nCC Bb | Red\nCC bb | Red\nCc BB | Red\nCc Bb | Red\nCc bb | Red\ncc BB | Brown\ncc Bb | Brown\ncc bb | Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: Cases where C is present or B is present.\n  - All except cc bb \u2192 15 cases\n- Brown: Cases where B is present (including when C is recessive).\n  - All except CC BB \u2192 15 cases\n- Checkered: Case where both C and B are recessive \u2192 1 case\n- None: Not applicable since all birds have either dominant or recessive alleles for at least one gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 15:15:1, but since 15+15=30, and the total is 31 (since each F2 bird has 4 alleles, 16 birds in total?), wait, no\u2014the Punnett square for F2 would have 16 birds, each with four alleles. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach F2 bird has four alleles, so 16 birds x 4 = 64 alleles in total. The phenotypic ratio can be determined by counting how many of each genotype lead to each phenotype.\n\nFrom the above table:\n\n- Red: 15 cases (all except cc bb)\n- Brown: 15 cases (all except CC BB)\n- Checkered: 1 case (cc bb)\n- None: 0 cases\n\nTotal: 15 + 15 + 1 = 31, leaving 3 cases unaccounted for. This suggests that my previous approach might be flawed because the presence of dominant alleles for at least one gene leads to red or brown, while being completely recessive leads to checkered. Wait, but perhaps the phenotype for red includes both when C is present and when B is present. Alternatively, perhaps red is when at least one dominant allele is present for either gene, and brown is when at least one dominant allele is present for B, regardless of C. That could make sense.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\nRed: Any bird that has at least one dominant allele for either gene \u2192 15 cases\nBrown: Any bird that has at least one dominant allele for B \u2192 15 cases (since even if C is recessive, as long as B is dominant, it's brown)\nCheckered: Birds that are completely recessive for both genes \u2192 1 case (cc bb)\nNone: Not applicable as all birds have at least one dominant allele somewhere.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 15:15:1, totaling 31, but since there are 16 birds, each bird has four alleles. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird has four alleles. The possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype Red\n- CC Bb: Phenotype Red\n- CC bb: Phenotype Red\n- Cc BB: Phenotype Red\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype Red\n- Cc bb: Phenotype Red\n- cc BB: Phenotype Brown\n- cc Bb: Phenotype Brown\n- cc bb: Phenotype Checkered\n\nSo, 15 birds with Red, 2 with Brown (since Cc BB and Cc Bb), and 1 with Checkered. Wait, no\u2014CC BB is one bird, CC Bb is another, etc. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation would produce 16 birds, each with four alleles. Let me count:\n\n- From the four possible gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb), each can combine with another, resulting in four types: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to create a Punnett square properly. The F1 was CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So the F2 would be:\n\n|       | CB | cb |\n|-------|----|----|\n| CB    | CcBb | CcBb |\n| cb    | CcBb | c c B b |\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead note that in the F2 generation, each gene is independent, and each has a 25% chance of producing each allele. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by multiplying the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% C, 75% c\n- B: 25% B, 75% b\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's define the phenotypes as follows:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Red\n2. One dominant, one recessive (either C dominant and B recessive, or vice versa): Brown\n3. Both genes recessive (c and b): Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B):\n\nProbability = (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n\n2. One dominant, one recessive (either C dominant and B recessive, or C recessive and B dominant):\n\nProbability = [25% C * 75% b] + [75% B * 25% c] = (18.75%) + (18.75%) = 37.5%\n\n3. Both genes recessive (c and b):\n\nProbability = (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nWait, but this adds up to 6.25% + 37.5% + 56.25% = 100%, which makes sense. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 6.25 : 37.5 : 56.25, which simplifies to dividing each by 6.25 to get 1 : 6 : 9.\n\nThis means that among the F2 generation, the ratio of Phenotypes would be:\n\n1 part: Red\n6 parts: Brown\n9 parts: Checkered\n\nBut let's verify this with the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6\nB. 6:2:6\nC. 9:3:9\nD. 1:3:1\nE. 3:9:3\nF. 4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2\nH. 5:3:2\nI. 7:5:1\n\nWait, none of these options match our calculation of 1:6:9. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other gene. So, if either gene is dominant, the bird is of a certain color. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele exists for either gene, the bird is of a certain color.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\n- Red: At least one dominant allele for C\n- Brown: At least one dominant allele for B\n- Checkered: Neither dominant allele for C nor B\n- None: Impossible, as all birds have at least one dominant allele.\n\nBut then, the phenotypes would depend on the combination. Let's re-calculate the probabilities accordingly.\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of each allele. The probability of having at least one dominant allele for gene C is 1 - (probability both alleles are recessive). Probability both alleles are recessive for C: (25% c)^2 = 6.25%. So, probability at least one dominant for C: 1 - 6.25% = 93.75%.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B: same logic.\n\nBut since the presence of dominant alleles for either gene leads to a phenotype, the phenotypic categories become:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Red\n2. Either dominant (C or B): Brown\n3. Neither dominant (c and b): Checkered\n\nWait, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nPhenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but only if both are present does a different phenotype occur. But the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, implying that C is the recessive trait (checkered) and non-C is the dominant trait (red). Similarly, B is dominant brown and b is recessive checkered.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but in practice, the phenotype would be determined by the combination. However, the problem specifies that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and brown by B, with red as the dominant for pigment color. So, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Checkered: Both C and B alleles are recessive \u2192 cc BB\n- Brown: At least one dominant allele for B \u2192 B present\n- Red: At least one dominant allele for C \u2192 C present\n- None: Impossible, as all birds have at least one dominant allele.\n\nBut this interpretation may not fit the standard dihybrid cross outcomes. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether any dominant alleles exist for each gene, but the presence of dominant alleles for both genes leads to a different phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the checkered pattern is due to C being recessive, and brown due to B being dominant. Therefore, the presence of a dominant allele for B would cause the bird to be brown, while the presence of a dominant allele for C would cause it to be red. The only exception is when both alleles are recessive, leading to checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Red\n2. At least one dominant (C or B): Brown\n3. Neither dominant (c and b): Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n2. At least one dominant (either C or B): 1 - 6.25% = 93.75%\n3. Neither dominant (c and b): (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier thought process. Let me think again. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for C or B would result in brown, while the presence of at least one recessive allele for C (i.e., c) would result in red. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it's red; if it has at least one dominant allele for B, it's brown. But if it has both dominant alleles, it's brown. If it has neither dominant allele, it's checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as:\n\n- If both alleles for C are recessive (cc), and B is also recessive (bb), then it's checkered.\n- Otherwise, if at least one dominant allele for C is present, it's red.\n- If at least one dominant allele for B is present, it's brown.\n- If both conditions are met, it's brown (since B is dominant).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and brown by B. So, perhaps the dominant phenotype is brown if B is present, red if C is present, and checkered if both are absent.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Checkered: (cc BB) \u2192 1 case\n2. Brown: (any bird with at least one dominant B, including those with C recessive)\n3. Red: (any bird with at least one dominant C, including those with B recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered: (75% c) * (100% B) \u2192 75%\nWait, no. Because B is a dominant gene, but the presence of B allows the bird to be brown. So, the only time it's not brown is when both B is recessive and C is recessive.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me use a Punnett square approach to determine the possible genotypic ratios and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- For gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combinations of these are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nCounting these:\n\n- Red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\n- Brown: Cases 7-8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 cases, which matches the 3x3 Punnett square (9 squares).\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Red: 6 cases\n- Brown: 2 cases\n- Checkered: 1 case\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 6:2:6, which doesn't match. Option E is 3:9:3, which isn't matching either. Option G is 12:2:2, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3, which is similar but reversed. Option F is 4:4:4, which is trihybrid. Option D is 1:3:1, which is a different ratio altogether. Option C is 9:3:3, which is trihybrid again. Option B is 6:2:6, which again doesn't fit. Option A is 6:2:6, which is double what we have. So none of the options seem to match exactly, but looking closely, option F is 4:4:4, which is a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the cases.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming that dominance is expressed regardless of the other gene, except that if both genes are present, the phenotype might change. But typically, dihybrids combine both traits. However, in this case, since each gene is controlled separately, the phenotypes are additive.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the F1 cross. Let me proceed methodically:\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each gene in F2:\n\nFor Gene C (C and c):\n- CC (dominant, red)\n- Cc (dominant, red)\n- cc (recessive, plain)\n\nFor Gene B (B and b):\n- BB (dominant, brown)\n- Bb (dominant, brown)\n- bb (recessive, checkered)\n\nThe combination of these two genes leads to different phenotypes. The phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other gene unless there's some interaction. However, in most cases, the dominance applies across both genes. But without specific information about interaction effects, we'll assume that the presence of any dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. \n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (since B is recessive and b is dominant)\n2. Plain (since c is recessive and C is dominant)\n3. Brown (since B is dominant and B is present)\n4. Red (since C is dominant and C is present)\n\nBut wait, how do these interact? If a bird is checkered (b) and has the B allele (B), it would still be brown. Similarly, if it's plain (C is recessive) and has B, it would be brown. Only when both genes are recessive (c and b) would it be plain. Also, if both genes are dominant (C and B), it would be red. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene is separate, so the presence of a dominant allele for either gene leads to the respective phenotype, ignoring the other gene. Wait, that's not correct either. In reality, both genes must be present for a particular phenotype, but sometimes there's an interaction where one gene masks the other. However, the problem statement doesn't mention such interactions, so I'll proceed under the assumption that each gene acts independently, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but combined together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotype depends on whether any gene is present. Let me try another approach. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both genes dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red\n2. CC Bb: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 red\n3. CC bb: C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 red\n4. Cc BB: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb: C and B dominant \u2192 red\n6. Cc bb: C dominant (red), b recessive \u2192 red\n7. cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 brown\n8. cc Bb: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 brown\n9. cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but according to this, all red phenotypes would include all cases where at least one dominant allele is present, except when both are recessive, leading to checkered. Alternatively, perhaps checkered is the phenotype when both genes are recessive, and brown is when B is present (regardless of C), and red is when C is present (regardless of B). Hmm, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me look back at the options given. The answer choices suggest various ratios, so perhaps I should calculate the expected number of each phenotype based on the Punnett square.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypic ratios are 1/16 for each of the four possible combinations (as per the earlier analysis), but since each gene is independent, the overall phenotypic ratio would be determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene. However, the actual phenotypes depend on whether any dominant allele is present for each gene.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the phenotypic ratios directly. Let's consider all possible genotypic combinations and map them to their phenotypes:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Red\nCC Bb | Red\nCC bb | Red\nCc BB | Red\nCc Bb | Red\nCc bb | Red\ncc BB | Brown\ncc Bb | Brown\ncc bb | Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: Cases where C is present or B is present.\n  - All except cc bb \u2192 15 cases\n- Brown: Cases where B is present (including when C is recessive).\n  - All except CC BB \u2192 15 cases\n- Checkered: Case where both C and B are recessive \u2192 1 case\n- None: Not applicable since all birds have either dominant or recessive alleles for at least one gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 15:15:1, but since 15+15=30, and the total is 31 (since each F2 bird has 4 alleles, 16 birds in total?), wait, no\u2014the Punnett square for F2 would have 16 birds, each with four alleles. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach F2 bird has four alleles, so 16 birds x 4 = 64 alleles in total. The phenotypic ratio can be determined by counting how many of each genotype lead to each phenotype.\n\nFrom the above table:\n\n- Red: 15 cases (all except cc bb)\n- Brown: 15 cases (all except CC BB)\n- Checkered: 1 case (cc bb)\n- None: 0 cases\n\nTotal: 15 + 15 + 1 = 31, leaving 3 cases unaccounted for. This suggests that my previous approach might be flawed because the presence of dominant alleles for at least one gene leads to red or brown, while being completely recessive leads to checkered. Wait, but perhaps the phenotype for red includes both when C is present and when B is present. Alternatively, perhaps red is when at least one dominant allele is present for either gene, and brown is when at least one dominant allele is present for B, regardless of C. That could make sense.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\nRed: Any bird that has at least one dominant allele for either gene \u2192 15 cases\nBrown: Any bird that has at least one dominant allele for B \u2192 15 cases (since even if C is recessive, as long as B is dominant, it's brown)\nCheckered: Birds that are completely recessive for both genes \u2192 1 case (cc bb)\nNone: Not applicable as all birds have at least one dominant allele somewhere.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 15:15:1, totaling 31, but since there are 16 birds, each bird has four alleles. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird has four alleles. The possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype Red\n- CC Bb: Phenotype Red\n- CC bb: Phenotype Red\n- Cc BB: Phenotype Red\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype Red\n- Cc bb: Phenotype Red\n- cc BB: Phenotype Brown\n- cc Bb: Phenotype Brown\n- cc bb: Phenotype Checkered\n\nSo, 15 birds with Red, 2 with Brown (since Cc BB and Cc Bb), and 1 with Checkered. Wait, no\u2014CC BB is one bird, CC Bb is another, etc. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation would produce 16 birds, each with four alleles. Let me count:\n\n- From the four possible gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb), each can combine with another, resulting in four types: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to create a Punnett square properly. The F1 was CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So the F2 would be:\n\n|       | CB | cb |\n|-------|----|----|\n| CB    | CcBb | CcBb |\n| cb    | CcBb | c c B b |\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead note that in the F2 generation, each gene is independent, and each has a 25% chance of producing each allele. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by multiplying the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% C, 75% c\n- B: 25% B, 75% b\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's define the phenotypes as follows:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Red\n2. One dominant, one recessive (either C dominant and B recessive, or vice versa): Brown\n3. Both genes recessive (c and b): Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B):\n\nProbability = (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n\n2. One dominant, one recessive (either C dominant and B recessive, or C recessive and B dominant):\n\nProbability = [25% C * 75% b] + [75% B * 25% c] = (18.75%) + (18.75%) = 37.5%\n\n3. Both genes recessive (c and b):\n\nProbability = (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nWait, but this adds up to 6.25% + 37.5% + 56.25% = 100%, which makes sense. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 6.25 : 37.5 : 56.25, which simplifies to dividing each by 6.25 to get 1 : 6 : 9.\n\nThis means that among the F2 generation, the ratio of Phenotypes would be:\n\n1 part: Red\n6 parts: Brown\n9 parts: Checkered\n\nBut let's verify this with the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6\nB. 6:2:6\nC. 9:3:9\nD. 1:3:1\nE. 3:9:3\nF. 4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2\nH. 5:3:2\nI. 7:5:1\n\nWait, none of these options match our calculation of 1:6:9. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other gene. So, if either gene is dominant, the bird is of a certain color. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele exists for either gene, the bird is of a certain color.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\n- Red: At least one dominant allele for C\n- Brown: At least one dominant allele for B\n- Checkered: Neither dominant allele for C nor B\n- None: Impossible, as all birds have at least one dominant allele.\n\nBut then, the phenotypes would depend on the combination.

However, the problem specifies that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and brown by B, with red as the dominant for pigment color.

Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for C or B would result in brown, while the presence of at least one recessive allele for C (i.e., c) would result in red. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it's red; if it has at least one dominant allele for B, it's brown. But if it has both dominant alleles, it's brown. If it has neither dominant allele, it's checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as:\n\n- If both alleles for C are recessive (cc), and B is also recessive (bb), then it's checkered.\n- Otherwise, if at least one dominant allele for C is present, it's red.\n- If at least one dominant allele for B is present, it's brown.\n- If both conditions are met, it's brown (since B is dominant).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and brown by B. So, perhaps the dominant phenotype is brown if B is present, red if C is present, and checkered if both are absent.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Checkered: (cc BB) \u2192 1 case\n2. Brown: (any bird with at least one dominant B, including those with C recessive)\n3. Red: (any bird with at least one dominant C, including those with B recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered: (75% c) * (100% B) \u2192 75%\nWait, no. Because B is a dominant gene, but the presence of B allows the bird to be brown. So, the only time it's not brown is when both B is recessive and C is recessive.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me use a Punnett square approach to determine the possible genotypic ratios and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- For gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combinations of these are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nCounting these:\n\n- Red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\n- Brown: Cases 7-8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 cases, which matches the 3x3 Punnett square (9 squares).\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Red: 6 cases\n- Brown: 2 cases\n- Checkered: 1 case\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 6:2:6, which doesn't match. Option E is 3:9:3, which isn't matching either. Option G is 12:2:2, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3, which is similar but reversed. Option F is 4:4:4, which is trihybrid. Option D is 1:3:1, which is a different ratio altogether. Option C is 9:3:3, which is trihybrid again. Option B is 6:2:6, which again doesn't fit. Option A is 6:2:6, which is double what we have. So none of the options seem to match exactly, but looking closely, option F is 4:4:4, which is a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the cases. Let me recount the genotypic ratios:\n\nEach gene has 25% for each allele, so the total combinations",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but when looking at the phenotype, the combination of both genes matters.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, but when looking at the phenotype, the combination of both genes matters. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it'll have a certain phenotype.\n\nSo for the F2:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the probability for pigment (C) being present is 3/4 (since recessive is 1/4), and the probability for color (B) being present is also 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. One dominant and one recessive for pigment: 2*(3/4)*(1/4)=6/16. Similarly for color. Wait, but for a bird to display a particular phenotype, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLet me list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red (C present) and color brown (B present)\n2. C_bb: Pigment red (C present) and color checkered (b present)\n3. ccBB: Pigment plain (c present) and color brown (B present)\n4. ccBb: Pigment plain (c present) and color checkered (b present)\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. The total is 16, so:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9 individuals\nPhenotype 2: C_bb \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 individuals\nPhenotype 3: ccBB \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 individuals\nPhenotype 4: ccBb \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 individual\n\nBut wait, this counts all possible combinations, including those where both genes are recessive (phenotype 4), which could be either plain red or plain brown depending on other factors. Wait, no\u2014in this case, each bird is a combination of both genes. So for phenotype 4 (ccBb), it's plain brown (since it's cc for pigment, which is plain, and Bb for color, which is brown). Similarly, phenotype 3 (ccBB) is plain red (since it's cc for pigment and BB for color, which is brown). Pheno 1 (C_B_) is red and brown, and pheno 2 (C_bb) is red and checkered.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Looking back, the user provided several options, including option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, my calculation suggests that there are 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. But the options don't match this directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype codes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letters are assigned differently. Maybe 'red' refers to the presence of C, regardless of B, and 'brown' refers to the presence of B regardless of C. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If C is present (red) AND B is present (brown): red-brown\n- If C is present (red) BUT B is absent (checkered): red-checkered\n- If C is absent (plain) BUT B is present (brown): plain-brown\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is absent (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nIn that scenario, the phenotypes correspond to the presence of C and B. Now, let's recalculate based on this assumption.\n\nThe F2 generation would have 16 birds, each with a 25% chance for each genotype. Let's count how many fall into each phenotype category:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc BB): This requires c (plain) and B (brown). How many? From the Punnett square, this occurs when the F1 gametes are cB and CB. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to look at the F2 genotypes.\n\nActually, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the dihybrid cross formula.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous for each gene (i.e., CC BB x cc bb), the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Let's see what that corresponds to.\n\nIn terms of phenotypes:\n\n- 9: Phenotype 1 (C_B_)\n- 3: Phenotype 2 (C_bb)\n- 3: Phenotype 3 (ccBB)\n- 1: Phenotype 4 (ccbb)\n\nAssuming that \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype of the pigment (c), and \"plain\" refers to the dominant pigment (C). Similarly, \"brown\" refers to the dominant color (B), and \"checkered\" refers to the recessive color (b).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. C_B_: red-brown\n2. C_bb: red-checkered\n3. ccBB: plain-brown\n4. ccbb: plain-checkered\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown: 9\n- Red-checkered: 3\n- Plain-brown: 3\n- Plain-checkered: 1\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which matches our previous total.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. Again, not matching. Option A says checkered red 6, etc.\u2014nope. Option E: checkered red 3, etc.\u2014nope. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still not matching. Option F: 4,4,4,4\u2014nope. Option C: 9,3,3,1\u2014which does match our calculation except for the labels.\n\nWait, but in the options, option G is checkered red 12, etc., which doesn't fit. Did I misinterpret the letters? Alternatively, perhaps the letters refer to the presence of each gene rather than the phenotype.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the letters represent dominance without considering the actual phenotype. For example, 'R' could stand for red, 'r' for plain; 'B' for brown, 'b' for checkered. So, any bird with at least one 'R' (dominant pigment) and at least one 'B' (dominant color) would be red-brown. A bird with at least one 'R' and no 'B' would be red-checkered. A bird with no 'R' and at least one 'B' would be plain-brown. A bird with neither 'R' nor 'B' would be plain-checkered.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- checkered red: No 'R' (C is recessive) and no 'B' (B is recessive) \u2192 ccbb: 1 bird\n- checkered brown: No 'R' (cc) and at least one 'B' (Bb or BB) \u2192 3 birds (since in F2, there are 4 possible BB, Bb, bB, bb; with bb being the only one with B missing. Wait, no\u2014wait, if the bird is checkered (so no 'R', i.e., cc), and brown (at least one 'B'), so B is present. So for F2, the possible genotypes are ccB_ (brown) and cc__ (checkered). Among these, the ones with B present are ccB_, which includes B_ (Bb or BB). So for each F2 individual, 25% chance to be ccBB, 50% ccBb, 25% ccbb.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered (cc), and needs to be brown, it must have at least one B. So among the F2, the percentage with B present is (number of B present) / total. For each F2 individual, the chance of being ccB_ is 3/4, and the chance of being ccBB is 1/4. So overall, in F2:\n\n- checkered red: 1 (from ccbb)\n- checkered brown: 3 (from ccB_ : 3/4 of 16=12? Wait, no. Wait, in F2, each trait is independent. So for each gene, 3/4 have the dominant allele. So the number of birds with both traits present is 9/16, and both absent is 1/16.\n\nBut if the question considers checkered as the recessive phenotype (no C), and brown as the dominant phenotype (B), then:\n\n- Checkered red: both genes recessive \u2192 ccbb: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: c (recessive) and B present \u2192 ccB_: which is 3/4 of the population, so 12 birds in 16?\nWait, no, 16 birds, 3/4 have B present, so 12 have B present. But among those, half have B_ and half have BB. Wait, no\u2014each bird has a 50% chance of being Bb and 50% BB. So in F2, the number of B present is 12 birds (3/4 of 16). Out of these 12, 3 are Bb and 9 are BB. So:\n\n- Checkered red: only ccbb: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 12 birds (all with at least one B)\n- Checkered brown further divided into checkered brown (B present) and plain brown (B absent). Wait, no\u2014I think I confused myself. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2:\n\n- Number of birds with both C present (C_) and B present (B_) \u2192 9 birds (9/16)\n- Number of birds with C present and B absent \u2192 3 birds (3/16)\n- Number of birds with C absent and B present \u2192 3 birds (3/16)\n- Number of birds with C absent and B absent \u2192 1 bird (1/16)\n\nNow, translating this into phenotype:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. ccBB \u2192 plain-brown\n4. ccbb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Red-brown: 9 birds\n- Red-checkered: 3 birds\n- Plain-brown: 3 birds\n- Plain-checkered: 1 bird\n\nWhich adds up to 16. Comparing this with the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes! This matches exactly.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nWait, but when looking at the phenotype, the combination of both genes matters. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it'll have a certain phenotype.\n\nSo for the F2:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the probability for pigment (C) being present is 3/4 (since recessive is 1/4), and the probability for color (B) being present is also 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. One dominant and one recessive for pigment: 2*(3/4)*(1/4)=6/16. Similarly for color. Wait, but for a bird to display a particular phenotype, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLet me list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red (C present) and color brown (B present)\n2. C_bb: Pigment red (C present) and color checkered (b present)\n3. ccBB: Pigment plain (c present) and color brown (B present)\n4. ccBb: Pigment plain (c present) and color checkered (b present)\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.

Wait, no\u2014in this case, each bird is a combination of both genes. So for phenotype 4 (ccBb), it's plain brown (since it's cc for pigment, which is plain, and Bb for color, which is brown). Similarly, phenotype 3 (ccBB) is plain red (since it's cc for pigment and BB for color, which is brown). Pheno 1 (C_B_) is red and brown, and pheno 2 (C_bb) is red and checkered.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Looking back, the user provided several options, including option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.

Similarly, \"brown\" refers to the dominant color (B), and \"checkered\" refers to the recessive color (b).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. C_B_: red-brown\n2. C_bb: red-checkered\n3. ccBB: plain-brown\n4. ccbb: plain-checkered\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown: 9\n- Red-checkered: 3\n- Plain-brown: 3\n- Plain-checkered: 1\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which matches our previous total.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. Again, not matching. Option A says checkered red 6, etc.\u2014nope. Option E: checkered red 3, etc.\u2014nope. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still not matching. Option F: 4,4,4,4\u2014nope. Option C: 9,3,3,1\u2014which does match our calculation except for the labels.\n\nWait, but in the options, option G is checkered red 12, etc., which doesn't fit. Did I misinterpret the letters? Alternatively, perhaps the letters refer to the presence of each gene rather than the phenotype.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the letters represent dominance without considering the actual phenotype. For example, 'R' could stand for red, 'r' for plain; 'B' for brown, 'b' for checkered. So, any bird with at least one 'R' (dominant pigment) and at least one 'B' (dominant color) would be red-brown. A bird with at least one 'R' and no 'B' would be red-checkered. A bird with no 'R' and at least one 'B' would be plain-brown. A bird with neither 'R' nor 'B' would be plain-checkered.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- checkered red: No 'R' (C is recessive) and no 'B' (B is recessive) \u2192 ccbb: 1 bird\n- checkered brown: No 'R' (cc) and at least one 'B' (Bb or BB) \u2192 3 birds (since in F2, there are 4 possible BB, Bb, bB, bb; with bb being the only one with B missing. Wait, no\u2014wait, if the bird is checkered (so no 'R', i.e., cc), and brown (at least one 'B'), so B is present. So for F2, the possible genotypes are ccB_ (brown) and cc__ (checkered). Among these, the ones with B present are ccB_, which includes B_ (Bb or BB). So for each F2 individual, 25% chance to be ccBB, 50% ccBb, 25% ccbb.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered (cc), and needs to be brown, it must have at least one B. So among the F2, the percentage with B present is (number of B present) / total. For each F2 individual, the chance of being ccB_ is 3/4, and the chance of being ccBB is 1/4. So overall, in F2:\n\n- checkered red: 1 (from ccbb)\n- checkered brown: 3 (from ccB_ : 3/4 of 16=12? Wait, no. Wait, in F2, each trait is independent. So for each gene, 3/4 have the dominant allele. So the number of birds with both traits present is 9/16, and both absent is 1/16.\n\nBut if the question considers checkered as the recessive phenotype (no C), and brown as the dominant phenotype (B), then:\n\n- Checkered red: both genes recessive \u2192 ccbb: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: c (recessive) and B present \u2192 ccB_: which is 3/4 of the population, so 12 birds in 16?\nWait, no, 16 birds, 3/4 have B present, so 12 have B present. But among those, half have B_ and half have BB. Wait, no\u2014each bird has a 50% chance of being Bb and 50% BB. So in F2, the number of B present is 12 birds (3/4 of 16). Out of these 12, 3 are Bb and 9 are BB. So:\n\n- Checkered red: only ccbb: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 12 birds (all with at least one B)\n- Checkered brown further divided into checkered brown (B present) and plain brown (B absent). Wait, no\u2014I think I confused myself. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2:\n\n- Number of birds with both C present (C_) and B present (B_) \u2192 9 birds (9/16)\n- Number of birds with C present and B absent \u2192 3 birds (3/16)\n- Number of birds with C absent and B present \u2192 3 birds (3/16)\n- Number of birds with C absent and B absent \u2192 1 bird (1/16)\n\nNow, translating this into phenotype:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. ccBB \u2192 plain-brown\n4. ccbb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Red-brown: 9 birds\n- Red-checkered: 3 birds\n- Plain-brown: 3 birds\n- Plain-checkered: 1 bird\n\nWhich adds up to 16. Comparing this with the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes! This matches exactly.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So, each gene has two outcomes.",
    "rollout": " So, each gene has two outcomes. But in reality, there are three phenotypes per gene: red, brown, checkered. However, in this case, since each gene has two alleles, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two genes. So, the total number of phenotypic categories is 3 \u00d7 3 = 9? Wait, no. Each gene contributes two possible outcomes, but when combined, they create four phenotypes if each gene is binary. But in our case, each gene has multiple phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014it's not that each gene has multiple phenotypes, but rather each gene's dominance affects the phenotype. So, each gene's effect is additive. For example, if both genes are present, the phenotype could be a combination like red brown, etc. But the user hasn't specified whether the genes interact. Assuming they don't, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of each dominant allele.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_): Both C and B dominant.\n2. Checkered brown (C_b_): C dominant, b recessive (but B is always brown).\nWait, no. If B is brown when dominant, and b makes it checkered. Similarly, C is red when dominant. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B both dominant \u2192 phenotype is red (C) and checkered (c).\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 phenotype brown.\n- Plain red: c and B recessive \u2192 phenotype plain.\n- Plain brown: c and b recessive \u2192 phenotype brown.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Because the phenotype depends on the alleles for each gene separately. So, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to different phenotypes. So:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n  - C present \u2192 red\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n\n- For Color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Brown: C and B present \u2192 red brown\n2. Pigmented and Checkered: C present, b \u2192 red checkered\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we'll use the fact that each gene is assorting independently. The probability for each gene is as follows:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C (red) \u2192 75% (since C is dominant, both alleles must be present)\n- c (plain) \u2192 25%\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B (brown) \u2192 75%\n- b (checkered) \u2192 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities. So, for each phenotype, we calculate the probability as the product of the probabilities for each trait being expressed.\n\nLet's list all four possible phenotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red (c and b): This requires both c and b alleles. Probability = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered brown (c and B): Requires c and B. Probability = (25%) * (75%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain red (c and b): This is same as checkered red. So, 6.25%\n4. Plain brown (c and B): Same as checkered brown. So, 18.75%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 49.999...%, which accounts for all possibilities except for the checkered and plain combinations where both traits are recessive. Wait, no\u2014the remaining would be 25% each for the other two phenotypes? Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (c and b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown (c and B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red (c and b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown (c and B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 49.9999\u2026%, which seems off. Wait, that can\u2019t be right. Let me see another approach.\n\nEach gene has two possibilities, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Brown: C and B \u2192 (75% * 75%) = 56.25%\n2. Pigmented and Checkered: C and b \u2192 (75% * 25%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B \u2192 (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and b \u2192 (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n\nYes, that adds up to 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nWait, but according to the user's options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't add up to 100%. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting a different calculation method, such as counting the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes without considering the percentages, treating each outcome equally. But that might not align with standard genetic calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the user is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation, implying that each phenotype corresponds to a certain count based on the number of individuals with those genotypes. So, instead of calculating probabilities, we need to count how many individuals have each phenotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 generation consists of four genotypes, each with a specific phenotype:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: Checkered plain\n- ccBB: Plain red\n- ccbb: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014if the genotype is CcBb, then:\n\n- For pigment (C): dominant, so red.\n- For color (B): dominant, so brown.\n\nSimilarly, Ccbb would be red and plain (because B is recessive).\n\nccBB would be plain red.\n\nccbb would be plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes correspond to:\n\n- C and B: Checkered brown\n- C and b: Checkered plain\n- c and B: Plain red\n- c and b: Plain brown\n\nNow, assuming that the F2 generation has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is typical for two independent genes with two alleles each (each showing two expressions). However, in this case, each gene has two expressions, leading to four phenotypes, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps we need to adjust based on the actual counts.\n\nIn a 9:3:3:1 ratio, the phenotypic ratio is typically represented as 9 checkered brown : 3 checkered plain : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown. But let's verify.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 is CcBb. The F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered brown)\n- 25% Ccbb (Checkered plain)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain red)\n- 25% ccbb (Plain brown)\n\nAssuming equal numbers, each phenotype would occur once. But since the options provided do not include 1:1:1:1, perhaps the user wants the ratio in terms of the number of individuals, considering only the dominant phenotypes?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simplifying and assuming that each combination results in a distinct phenotype, regardless of dominance, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones, but that would complicate things further.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which is less than 16 (summing 6+2+6+2=16). But according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the sum should be 16 parts.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 model, but some phenotypes may not even exist in the F2 generation if they require certain genotypes.\n\nWait, in reality, the F2 generation does produce all four phenotypes: Checkered brown, Checkered plain, Plain red, Plain brown. So none of the options have zero counts for any phenotype. Thus, perhaps the user is mistaken in omitting some phenotypes, or the question is simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, but that wouldn't make sense because dominance affects the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to the phenotypic ratio without accounting for the dominance hierarchy, but that still doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the presence of each trait, not the interaction between them. For example, if both traits are required, then the phenotypes would be fewer. But in reality, each trait is independent, so all four phenotypes are possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014that sums to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's double-check:\n\nIn a 9:3:3:1 ratio, each part represents 9, 3, 3, 1 respectively. So, if we take:\n\n- Checkered brown: 9\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThat would sum to 16, which matches the F2 generation. So, looking back at the options:\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution is reversed compared to 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, and the distribution is 3:9:1:3, which is similar to 9:3:3:1 but with the first and last parts swapped.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16, and the distribution is 9:3:3:1, which matches perfectly.\n\nWait, that makes sense. In the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the four phenotypes are in the order Checkered brown (9), Checkered plain (3), Plain red (3), Plain brown (1). So, option C states 9, 3, 3, 1, which is exactly the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back at the original question, the user didn't specify whether the phenotypes should be ordered in a particular way, but generally, they are listed in the order of the letters C, B, c, b or something similar. However, the key point is the ratio itself.\n\nThus, the correct answer should reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So, each gene has two outcomes. But in reality, there are three phenotypes per gene: red, brown, checkered. However, in this case, since each gene has two alleles, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two genes. So, the total number of phenotypic categories is 3 \u00d7 3 = 9? Wait, no. Each gene contributes two possible outcomes, but when combined, they create four phenotypes if each gene is binary. But in our case, each gene has multiple phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014it's not that each gene has multiple phenotypes, but rather each gene's dominance affects the phenotype. So, each gene's effect is additive. For example, if both genes are present, the phenotype could be a combination like red brown, etc. But the user hasn't specified whether the genes interact. Assuming they don't, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of each dominant allele.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_): Both C and B dominant.\n2. Checkered brown (C_b_): C dominant, b recessive (but B is always brown).\nWait, no. If B is brown when dominant, and b makes it checkered. Similarly, C is red when dominant. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B both dominant \u2192 phenotype is red (C) and checkered (c).\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 phenotype brown.\n- Plain red: c and B recessive \u2192 phenotype plain.\n- Plain brown: c and b recessive \u2192 phenotype brown.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Because the phenotype depends on the alleles for each gene separately. So, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to different phenotypes. So:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n  - C present \u2192 red\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n\n- For Color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Brown: C and B present \u2192 red brown\n2. Pigmented and Checkered: C present, b \u2192 red checkered\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we'll use the fact that each gene is assorting independently. The probability for each gene is as follows:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C (red) \u2192 75% (since C is dominant, both alleles must be present)\n- c (plain) \u2192 25%\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B (brown) \u2192 75%\n- b (checkered) \u2192 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities. So, for each phenotype, we calculate the probability as the product of the probabilities for each trait being expressed.\n\nLet's list all four possible phenotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red (c and b): This requires both c and b alleles. Probability = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered brown (c and B): Requires c and B. Probability = (25%) * (75%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain red (c and b): This is same as checkered red. So, 6.25%\n4. Plain brown (c and B): Same as checkered brown. So, 18.75%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 49.999...%, which accounts for all possibilities except for the checkered and plain combinations where both traits are recessive. Wait, no\u2014the remaining would be 25% each for the other two phenotypes? Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (c and b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown (c and B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red (c and b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown (c and B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 49.9999\u2026%, which seems off. Wait, that can\u2019t be right. Let me see another approach.\n\nEach gene has two possibilities, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Brown: C and B \u2192 (75% * 75%) = 56.25%\n2. Pigmented and Checkered: C and b \u2192 (75% * 25%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B \u2192 (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and b \u2192 (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n\nYes, that adds up to 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nWait, but according to the user's options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't add up to 100%. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting a different calculation method, such as counting the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes without considering the percentages, treating each outcome equally. But that might not align with standard genetic calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the user is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation, implying that each phenotype corresponds to a certain count based on the number of individuals with those genotypes. So, instead of calculating probabilities, we need to count how many individuals have each phenotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 generation consists of four genotypes, each with a specific phenotype:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: Checkered plain\n- ccBB: Plain red\n- ccbb: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014if the genotype is CcBb, then:\n\n- For pigment (C): dominant, so red.\n- For color (B): dominant, so brown.\n\nSimilarly, Ccbb would be red and plain (because B is recessive).\n\nccBB would be plain red.\n\nccbb would be plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes correspond to:\n\n- C and B: Checkered brown\n- C and b: Checkered plain\n- c and B: Plain red\n- c and b: Plain brown\n\nNow, assuming that the F2 generation has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is typical for two independent genes with two alleles each (each showing two expressions). However, in this case, each gene has two expressions, leading to four phenotypes, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps we need to adjust based on the actual counts.\n\nIn a 9:3:3:1 ratio, the phenotypic ratio is typically represented as 9 checkered brown : 3 checkered plain : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown. But let's verify.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 is CcBb. The F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered brown)\n- 25% Ccbb (Checkered plain)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain red)\n- 25% ccbb (Plain brown)\n\nAssuming equal numbers, each phenotype would occur once. But since the options provided do not include 1:1:1:1, perhaps the user wants the ratio in terms of the number of individuals, considering only the dominant phenotypes?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simplifying and assuming that each combination results in a distinct phenotype, regardless of dominance, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones, but that would complicate things further.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which is less than 16 (summing 6+2+6+2=16). But according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the sum should be 16 parts.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 model, but some phenotypes may not even exist in the F2 generation if they require certain genotypes.\n\nWait, in reality, the F2 generation does produce all four phenotypes: Checkered brown, Checkered plain, Plain red, Plain brown. So none of the options have zero counts for any phenotype. Thus, perhaps the user is mistaken in omitting some phenotypes, or the question is simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, but that wouldn't make sense because dominance affects the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to the phenotypic ratio without accounting for the dominance hierarchy, but that still doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the presence of each trait, not the interaction between them. For example, if both traits are required, then the phenotypes would be fewer. But in reality, each trait is independent, so all four phenotypes are possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014that sums to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's double-check:\n\nIn a 9:3:3:1 ratio, each part represents 9, 3, 3, 1 respectively. So, if we take:\n\n- Checkered brown: 9\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThat would sum to 16, which matches the F2 generation. So, looking back at the options:\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution is reversed compared to 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, and the distribution is 3:9:1:3, which is similar to 9:3:3:1 but with the first and last parts swapped.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16, and the distribution is 9:3:3:1, which matches perfectly.\n\nWait, that makes sense. In the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the four phenotypes are in the order Checkered brown (9), Checkered plain (3), Plain red (3), Plain brown (1). So, option C states 9, 3, 3, 1, which is exactly the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back at the original question, the user didn't specify whether the phenotypes should be ordered in a particular way, but generally, they are listed in the order of the letters C, B, c, b or something similar. However, the key point is the ratio itself.\n\nThus, the correct answer should reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

Alternatively, considering the dominance, some combinations may result in the same phenotype.

Let me consider the two traits separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, for pigment color (gene C):\n\n- Presence of C (dominant) leads to red\n- Absence of C (recessive c) leads to plain\n\nSo the probability of being red is 75% (since CC and Cc are red), and plain is 25%.\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- Presence of B (dominant) leads to brown\n- Absence of B (recessive b) leads to checkered\n\nProbability of brown is 75%, and checkered is 25%.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\nTotal phenotypic classes:\n\n1.

Actually, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele allows for the phenotype. So the probability of being red (for pigment) is 3/4, and the probability of being brown (for color) is 3/4. But since both need to be present for each trait, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of being red-checkered is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16, plain-brown is (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16, and plain-checkered is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9 parts\n- Red-Checkered: 3 parts\n- Plain-Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain-Checkered: 1 part\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense because there are 16 possible combinations (each of the 4 gametes contributes to one of the 4 phenotypes).\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but combined, how does that work?",
    "rollout": " So each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but combined, how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible genotypes and then determine their phenotypes. Alternatively, use the Punnett square to map all possible outcomes.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that each gene is independent, so the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the ratios for each gene. For example:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- Dominant (C) : 2/3\n- Recessive (c) : 1/3\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- Dominant (B) : 2/3\n- Recessive (b) : 1/3\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratios are multiplied. That is, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of the individual traits.\n\nSo, the total number of phenotypes depends on the combinations of pigment and color. Let's list them:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): This happens when c (checkered) is present and B (brown) is present.\n2. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Wait, no. Actually, checkered is when c is dominant. Wait, no, the dominance hierarchy is important here. The phenotype depends on both genes. For the C gene, c is plain, while C is red. For the B gene, B is brown, while b is checkered. So, when both genes are recessive, the phenotype is checkered and brown. If either gene is dominant, the phenotype changes accordingly.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered and Brown (Checkered-Brown)\n2. CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red and Checkered (Red-Checkered)\n3. CC bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red and Checkered (Same as above)\n4. Cc BB: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and Brown (Plain-Brown)\n5. Cc Bb: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Plain-Checkered)\n6. Cc bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Same as point 4)\n7. cc BB: Both genes recessive \u2192 Plain and Brown (Plain-Brown)\n8. cc Bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Plain-Checkered)\n9. cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Same as point 7)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nEach combination leads to a specific phenotype. Let's count the number of each type:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered (same as CC Bb)\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered (same as Cc Bb)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 instance (CC BB)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 instances (CC Bb and CC bb)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 instances (Cc BB and cc BB)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 instances (Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, CC BB is 1.\n\nCC Bb and CC bb: 2\n\nCc BB and cc BB: 2\n\nCc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb: 4\n\nTotal instances: 1+2+2+4=9, which makes sense since F2 is 3x3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (out of 9)\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 5\n\nSo translating into numbers: Checkered-Brown 1, Red-Checkered 2, Plain-Brown 2, Plain-Checkered 5. But looking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2013 No.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2013 No.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2013 Hmm, our counts are 1,2,2,5, but option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2013 No.\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2013 No.\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2013 No.\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2013 No.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2013 No.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2013 No.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes.\n\nLooking back, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered-Brown\n2. CC Bb: Red-Checkered\n3. CC bb: Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Plain-Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n6. Cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n9. cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (1)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 (2 and 3)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 (4 and 7)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 (5,6,8,9)\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:2:5, meaning:\n\nCheckered-Brown: 1 part\nRed-Checkered: 2 parts\nPlain-Brown: 2 parts\nPlain-Checkered: 5 parts\n\nAdding up to 10 parts, which contradicts our earlier conclusion of 9. Wait, where did I go wrong? Oh, I see! I must have miscalculated the total. Let's sum the counts:\n\n1 (Checkered-Brown) + 2 (Red-Checkered) + 2 (Plain-Brown) + 5 (Plain-Checkered) = 10, but there are only 9 individuals. So clearly, I made an error in counting.\n\nAh, right! Each genotype maps to one phenotype, but some phenotypes may overlap. Let me re-express the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (1)\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered (2)\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered (3)\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown (4)\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Checkered (5)\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered (6)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (7)\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered (8)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (9)\n\nNow, categorizing by phenotype:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (phenotype 1)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 (phenotypes 2 & 3)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 (phenotypes 4 & 7)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 (phenotypes 5,6,8,9)\n\nTotal: 1+2+2+5=10, which exceeds the 9 individuals. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the way I counted. Perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, no. Each of the 9 individuals contributes to one phenotype. So perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nBecause:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2\n- CC bb: 3 (but these are both Red-Checkered, so 2)\n- Cc BB: 4\n- Cc Bb: 5\n- Cc bb: 6\n- cc BB: 7\n- cc Bb: 8\n- cc bb: 9\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try another approach: Each F2 individual has a unique genotype, so each can be categorized. There are 9 F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nPhenotype for each:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Red-Checkered\n4. Plain-Brown\n5. Plain-Checkered\n6. Plain-Checkered\n7. Plain-Brown\n8. Plain-Checkered\n9. Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, grouping:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (phenotype 1)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 (phenotypes 2 & 3)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 (phenotypes 4 & 7)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 (phenotypes 5,6,8,9)\n\nThis totals 1+2+2+5=10, which isn't possible. So I must have miscounted. Let's list each:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Red-Checkered\n4. Plain-Brown\n5. Plain-Checkered\n6. Plain-Checkered\n7. Plain-Brown\n8. Plain-Checkered\n9. Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 5\n\nThat adds up to 10, which suggests I've made a mistake because there are only 9 individuals. Therefore, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nWhich sums to 9. How did I get 5 before? Because I thought there were five Plain-Checkered, but according to this, it's four. Wait, let me recount:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown (1)\n2. Red-Checkered (2)\n3. Red-Checkered (3)\n4. Plain-Brown (4)\n5. Plain-Checkered (5)\n6. Plain-Checkered (6)\n7. Plain-Brown (7)\n8. Plain-Checkered (8)\n9. Plain-Checkered (9)\n\nSo, Plain-Checkered appears on phenotypes 5,6,8,9: four instances. So the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:2:4, which simplifies to 1:2:2:4.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match this. Let me look through the choices again.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match what I derived. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the F2 population. Another possibility is that the F2 population includes both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, leading to different phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this using Punnett squares without considering the order, focusing on the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is all the gametes CB and cb, so F1 is CcBb. In the next generation, F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. To construct the Punnett square:\n\n- Each gamete is either CB or cb, each with 50% chance.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nThen, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered (50%)\n- cc bb: Plain-Brown (25%) and Plain-Checkered (25%). Wait, no, cc Bb and cc bb are both plain, regardless of the B locus.\n\nWait, no. The phenotype is determined by both loci. So, for cc Bb: Both recessive, so plain. Similarly, cc bb: Both recessive, so plain. So, the phenotypes for cc are both plain, irrespective of B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered (50%)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (25%)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (25%)\n\nSo, the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1.\n\nTranslating to actual counts (assuming 100 flies):\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 25\n- Red-Checkered: 50\n- Plain-Brown: 25\n- Plain-Checkered: 25\n\nTotal: 125, which seems too high. Wait, no, because in reality, each F2 generation has 9 individuals (as per the earlier calculation). So perhaps I should scale down.\n\nIn the F2 generation, 25% of 9 is 2.25, but since we can't have fractions, we'll round to whole numbers. However, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the proper way is to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the genotypic ratios.\n\nGiven that the F2 genotypes are CC BB (25%), Cc Bb (50%), cc BB (25%), and cc bb (25%), but with some overlapping phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B. So, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, meaning 25% Checkered-Brown, 50% Red-Checkered, 25% Plain-Brown, and 25% Plain-Checkered. Adding up to 100%.\n\nHowever, when calculating the actual counts among 9 individuals, we'd expect:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 2.25 \u2248 2\n- Red-Checkered: 4.5 \u2248 4\n- Plain-Brown: 2.25 \u2248 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 2.25 \u2248 2\n\nBut since we can't have half flies, let's assume the counts are approximately 2, 4, 2, 2, totaling 10, which is close to 9 due to rounding. But this still doesn't match any of the options perfectly.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to fit exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Option H states: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". That would imply a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which doesn't add up to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which also doesn't align. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds to 16 as well. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the F2 generation. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb. The F2 is formed by crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by both C and B:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered (50%)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (25%)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (25%)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, but scaled to 9 individuals:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 2.25 \u2192 approx 2\n- Red-Checkered: 4.5 \u2192 approx 4\n- Plain-Brown: 2.25 \u2192 approx 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 2.25 \u2192 approx 2\n\nBut since we can't have fractions, perhaps we accept 2,4,2,2. But the options don't reflect this precisely. Looking back, option G says Checkered red",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but combined, how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible genotypes and then determine their phenotypes. Alternatively, use the Punnett square to map all possible outcomes.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that each gene is independent, so the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the ratios for each gene. For example:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- Dominant (C) : 2/3\n- Recessive (c) : 1/3\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- Dominant (B) : 2/3\n- Recessive (b) : 1/3\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratios are multiplied. That is, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of the individual traits.\n\nSo, the total number of phenotypes depends on the combinations of pigment and color. Let's list them:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): This happens when c (checkered) is present and B (brown) is present.\n2. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Wait, no. Actually, checkered is when c is dominant. Wait, no, the dominance hierarchy is important here. The phenotype depends on both genes. For the C gene, c is plain, while C is red. For the B gene, B is brown, while b is checkered. So, when both genes are recessive, the phenotype is checkered and brown. If either gene is dominant, the phenotype changes accordingly.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered and Brown (Checkered-Brown)\n2. CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red and Checkered (Red-Checkered)\n3.

Let's count the number of each type:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered (same as CC Bb)\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered (same as Cc Bb)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 instance (CC BB)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 instances (CC Bb and CC bb)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 instances (Cc BB and cc BB)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 instances (Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, CC BB is 1.\n\nCC Bb and CC bb: 2\n\nCc BB and cc BB: 2\n\nCc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb: 4\n\nTotal instances: 1+2+2+4=9, which makes sense since F2 is 3x3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (out of 9)\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 5\n\nSo translating into numbers: Checkered-Brown 1, Red-Checkered 2, Plain-Brown 2, Plain-Checkered 5. But looking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2013 No.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2013 No.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2013 Hmm, our counts are 1,2,2,5, but option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2013 No.\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2013 No.\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2013 No.\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2013 No.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2013 No.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2013 No.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes.\n\nLooking back, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered-Brown\n2. CC Bb: Red-Checkered\n3. CC bb: Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Plain-Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n6. Cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n9. cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (1)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 (2 and 3)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 (4 and 7)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 (5,6,8,9)\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:2:5, meaning:\n\nCheckered-Brown: 1 part\nRed-Checkered: 2 parts\nPlain-Brown: 2 parts\nPlain-Checkered: 5 parts\n\nAdding up to 10 parts, which contradicts our earlier conclusion of 9. Wait, where did I go wrong? Oh, I see! I must have miscalculated the total. Let's sum the counts:\n\n1 (Checkered-Brown) + 2 (Red-Checkered) + 2 (Plain-Brown) + 5 (Plain-Checkered) = 10, but there are only 9 individuals. So clearly, I made an error in counting.\n\nAh, right! Each genotype maps to one phenotype, but some phenotypes may overlap. Let me re-express the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (1)\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered (2)\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered (3)\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown (4)\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Checkered (5)\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered (6)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (7)\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered (8)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (9)\n\nNow, categorizing by phenotype:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (phenotype 1)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 (phenotypes 2 & 3)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 (phenotypes 4 & 7)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 (phenotypes 5,6,8,9)\n\nTotal: 1+2+2+5=10, which exceeds the 9 individuals. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the way I counted. Perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, no. Each of the 9 individuals contributes to one phenotype. So perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nBecause:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2\n- CC bb: 3 (but these are both Red-Checkered, so 2)\n- Cc BB: 4\n- Cc Bb: 5\n- Cc bb: 6\n- cc BB: 7\n- cc Bb: 8\n- cc bb: 9\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try another approach: Each F2 individual has a unique genotype, so each can be categorized. There are 9 F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nPhenotype for each:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Red-Checkered\n4. Plain-Brown\n5. Plain-Checkered\n6. Plain-Checkered\n7. Plain-Brown\n8. Plain-Checkered\n9. Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, grouping:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1 (phenotype 1)\n- Red-Checkered: 2 (phenotypes 2 & 3)\n- Plain-Brown: 2 (phenotypes 4 & 7)\n- Plain-Checkered: 5 (phenotypes 5,6,8,9)\n\nThis totals 1+2+2+5=10, which isn't possible. So I must have miscounted. Let's list each:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Red-Checkered\n4. Plain-Brown\n5. Plain-Checkered\n6. Plain-Checkered\n7. Plain-Brown\n8. Plain-Checkered\n9. Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 5\n\nThat adds up to 10, which suggests I've made a mistake because there are only 9 individuals. Therefore, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nWhich sums to 9. How did I get 5 before? Because I thought there were five Plain-Checkered, but according to this, it's four. Wait, let me recount:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown (1)\n2. Red-Checkered (2)\n3. Red-Checkered (3)\n4. Plain-Brown (4)\n5. Plain-Checkered (5)\n6. Plain-Checkered (6)\n7. Plain-Brown (7)\n8. Plain-Checkered (8)\n9. Plain-Checkered (9)\n\nSo, Plain-Checkered appears on phenotypes 5,6,8,9: four instances. So the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 1\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:2:4, which simplifies to 1:2:2:4.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match this. Let me look through the choices again.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match what I derived. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the F2 population. Another possibility is that the F2 population includes both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, leading to different phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this using Punnett squares without considering the order, focusing on the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is all the gametes CB and cb, so F1 is CcBb. In the next generation, F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. To construct the Punnett square:\n\n- Each gamete is either CB or cb, each with 50% chance.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nThen, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered (50%)\n- cc bb: Plain-Brown (25%) and Plain-Checkered (25%). Wait, no, cc Bb and cc bb are both plain, regardless of the B locus.\n\nWait, no. The phenotype is determined by both loci. So, for cc Bb: Both recessive, so plain. Similarly, cc bb: Both recessive, so plain. So, the phenotypes for cc are both plain, irrespective of B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered (50%)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (25%)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (25%)\n\nSo, the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1.\n\nTranslating to actual counts (assuming 100 flies):\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 25\n- Red-Checkered: 50\n- Plain-Brown: 25\n- Plain-Checkered: 25\n\nTotal: 125, which seems too high. Wait, no, because in reality, each F2 generation has 9 individuals (as per the earlier calculation). So perhaps I should scale down.\n\nIn the F2 generation, 25% of 9 is 2.25, but since we can't have fractions, we'll round to whole numbers. However, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the proper way is to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the genotypic ratios.\n\nGiven that the F2 genotypes are CC BB (25%), Cc Bb (50%), cc BB (25%), and cc bb (25%), but with some overlapping phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B. So, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, meaning 25% Checkered-Brown, 50% Red-Checkered, 25% Plain-Brown, and 25% Plain-Checkered. Adding up to 100%.\n\nHowever, when calculating the actual counts among 9 individuals, we'd expect:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 2.25 \u2248 2\n- Red-Checkered: 4.5 \u2248 4\n- Plain-Brown: 2.25 \u2248 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 2.25 \u2248 2\n\nBut since we can't have half flies, let's assume the counts are approximately 2, 4, 2, 2, totaling 10, which is close to 9 due to rounding. But this still doesn't match any of the options perfectly.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to fit exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Option H states: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". That would imply a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which doesn't add up to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which also doesn't align. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds to 16 as well. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the F2 generation. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb. The F2 is formed by crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by both C and B:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered-Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red-Checkered (50%)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (25%)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (25%)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, but scaled to 9 individuals:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 2.25 \u2192 approx 2\n- Red-Checkered: 4.5 \u2192 approx 4\n- Plain-Brown: 2.25 \u2192 approx 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 2.25 \u2192 approx 2\n\nBut since we can't have fractions, perhaps we accept 2,4,2,2. But the options don't reflect this precisely. Looking back, option G says Checkered red",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming that both genes are codominant, the phenotype is determined by dominance.",
    "rollout": " Assuming that both genes are codominant, the phenotype is determined by dominance. So each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypic categories.\n\nTo get the overall F2 phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the proportion for each possible combination:\n\n1. Both C and B present: red, brown \u2192 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8\n2. C present, B absent: red, checkered \u2192 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n3. C absent, B present: plain, brown \u2192 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8\n4. Both C and B absent: plain, checkered \u2192 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. For each gene, there are three possible phenotypes (assuming codominance), but in reality, it's binary for each gene. Wait, no. Each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the possible phenotypes are determined by the dominant allele. So for pigment color (C): presence (red) or absence (plain). Similarly, for color (B): presence (brown) or absence (checkered).\n\nThe overall F2 phenotypic ratio combines these two traits. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to four possible combinations of traits: (Red/Brown), (Red/Checkered), (Plain/Brown), (Plain/Checkered). The probabilities for each combination are:\n\n- Red/Brown: (C present) * (B present) = (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8\n- Red/Checkered: (C present) * (B absent) = (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n- Plain/Brown: (C absent) * (B present) = (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8\n- Plain/Checkered: (C absent) * (B absent) = (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n\nSo the total phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1 for Red/Brown : Red/Checkered : Plain/Brown : Plain/Checkered. But the options given don't exactly match this. Looking back at the choices, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, none of them perfectly matches my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the genes. Pigmentation is controlled by C and B. Checkered is c and b. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n\nBut when considering phenotypes, we look for whether each gene is present or not. Let's list the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Red, Brown\n- CC Bb: Red, Brown (since B is dominant)\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown\n\nWait, no. Because B is dominant, regardless of whether it's B or b, if B is present (at least one B allele), then the bird is brown. If B is absent (both alleles b), then it's plain. Similarly for C.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present: Red, Brown\n2. C present, B absent: Red, Plain\n3. C absent, B present: Plain, Brown\n4. C absent, B absent: Plain, Plain\n\nNow, how many individuals fall into each category?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the probability of each outcome is:\n\n- For C: presence (C_) is \u00be, absence is \u00bc.\n- For B: presence (B_) is \u00be, absence is \u00bc.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\n- All three present (C_, B_): \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- C present, B absent: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- C absent, B present: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- All three absent: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nWait, but this isn't correct because each gene is codominant, meaning the presence of one dominant allele masks the other. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of any dominant allele, not the exact combination. So the actual probabilities are:\n\n- C present (regardless of B): \u00be\n- B present (regardless of C): \u00be\nTherefore, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- C present AND B present: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- C present AND B absent: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- C absent AND B present: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- C absent AND B absent: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red, Brown: 9/16\n- Red, Plain: 3/16\n- Plain, Brown: 3/16\n- Plain, Plain: 1/16\n\nMultiplying these fractions by the total number of F2 individuals (which is 16):\n\n- 9: Red, Brown\n- 3: Red, Plain\n- 3: Plain, Brown\n- 1: Plain, Plain\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 This seems like the reverse of what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, not the absolute counts. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly state this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio within each trait.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: consider each gene separately.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (Red): \u00be\n- Absence (Plain): \u00bc\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Presence (Brown): \u00be\n- Absence (Checkered): \u00bc\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Red, Brown: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- Red, Checkered: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- Plain, Brown: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- Plain, Checkered: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 3:1:3:1 when simplified. But none of the options reflect this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Also not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's asking for the ratio of checkered vs. plain in each trait. For example, checkered red and checkered brown versus plain red and plain brown. \n\nIn that case:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 (from C_ and B_)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (C_ and bb)\n- Plain red: 3 (cc and B_)\n- Plain brown: 1 (cc and bb)\n\nThis would give a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which could be represented as 9:3:3:1. But the options don't provide this exact ratio.\n\nWait, looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me recount. In a dihybrid cross where each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. So 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options match this exactly. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps the question is considering only one trait per bird. For instance, the checkered color is separate from the pigment color. So:\n\n- For the checkered trait (c and b):\n  - Presence (checkered): \u00be\n  - Absence (plain): \u00bc\n- For pigment color (C and B):\n  - Presence (red): \u00be\n  - Absence (brown): \u00bc\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is still 9:3:3:1. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of checkered vs. plain across both traits.\n\nWait, the question says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That adds up to 16, which makes sense. So the correct ratio is 6:2:6:2. Which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But the options don't have this. Let me see:\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6 red checkered, 2 brown checkered, 6 red plain, 2 brown plain \u2192 This matches exactly!

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming that both genes are codominant, the phenotype is determined by dominance. So each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypic categories.\n\nTo get the overall F2 phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the proportion for each possible combination:\n\n1. Both C and B present: red, brown \u2192 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8\n2. C present, B absent: red, checkered \u2192 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n3. C absent, B present: plain, brown \u2192 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8\n4. Both C and B absent: plain, checkered \u2192 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. For each gene, there are three possible phenotypes (assuming codominance), but in reality, it's binary for each gene. Wait, no. Each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the possible phenotypes are determined by the dominant allele. So for pigment color (C): presence (red) or absence (plain). Similarly, for color (B): presence (brown) or absence (checkered).\n\nThe overall F2 phenotypic ratio combines these two traits. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to four possible combinations of traits: (Red/Brown), (Red/Checkered), (Plain/Brown), (Plain/Checkered). The probabilities for each combination are:\n\n- Red/Brown: (C present) * (B present) = (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8\n- Red/Checkered: (C present) * (B absent) = (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n- Plain/Brown: (C absent) * (B present) = (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8\n- Plain/Checkered: (C absent) * (B absent) = (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n\nSo the total phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1 for Red/Brown : Red/Checkered : Plain/Brown : Plain/Checkered. But the options given don't exactly match this. Looking back at the choices, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, none of them perfectly matches my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the genes. Pigmentation is controlled by C and B. Checkered is c and b. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n\nBut when considering phenotypes, we look for whether each gene is present or not. Let's list the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Red, Brown\n- CC Bb: Red, Brown (since B is dominant)\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown\n\nWait, no. Because B is dominant, regardless of whether it's B or b, if B is present (at least one B allele), then the bird is brown. If B is absent (both alleles b), then it's plain. Similarly for C.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present: Red, Brown\n2. C present, B absent: Red, Plain\n3. C absent, B present: Plain, Brown\n4. C absent, B absent: Plain, Plain\n\nNow, how many individuals fall into each category?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the probability of each outcome is:\n\n- For C: presence (C_) is \u00be, absence is \u00bc.\n- For B: presence (B_) is \u00be, absence is \u00bc.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\n- All three present (C_, B_): \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- C present, B absent: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- C absent, B present: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- All three absent: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nWait, but this isn't correct because each gene is codominant, meaning the presence of one dominant allele masks the other. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of any dominant allele, not the exact combination. So the actual probabilities are:\n\n- C present (regardless of B): \u00be\n- B present (regardless of C): \u00be\nTherefore, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- C present AND B present: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- C present AND B absent: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- C absent AND B present: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- C absent AND B absent: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red, Brown: 9/16\n- Red, Plain: 3/16\n- Plain, Brown: 3/16\n- Plain, Plain: 1/16\n\nMultiplying these fractions by the total number of F2 individuals (which is 16):\n\n- 9: Red, Brown\n- 3: Red, Plain\n- 3: Plain, Brown\n- 1: Plain, Plain\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 This seems like the reverse of what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, not the absolute counts. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly state this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio within each trait.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: consider each gene separately.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (Red): \u00be\n- Absence (Plain): \u00bc\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Presence (Brown): \u00be\n- Absence (Checkered): \u00bc\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Red, Brown: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- Red, Checkered: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- Plain, Brown: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- Plain, Checkered: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 3:1:3:1 when simplified. But none of the options reflect this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Also not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's asking for the ratio of checkered vs. plain in each trait. For example, checkered red and checkered brown versus plain red and plain brown. \n\nIn that case:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 (from C_ and B_)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (C_ and bb)\n- Plain red: 3 (cc and B_)\n- Plain brown: 1 (cc and bb)\n\nThis would give a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which could be represented as 9:3:3:1. But the options don't provide this exact ratio.\n\nWait, looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me recount. In a dihybrid cross where each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. So 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options match this exactly. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps the question is considering only one trait per bird. For instance, the checkered color is separate from the pigment color. So:\n\n- For the checkered trait (c and b):\n  - Presence (checkered): \u00be\n  - Absence (plain): \u00bc\n- For pigment color (C and B):\n  - Presence (red): \u00be\n  - Absence (brown): \u00bc\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is still 9:3:3:1. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of checkered vs. plain across both traits.\n\nWait, the question says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That adds up to 16, which makes sense. So the correct ratio is 6:2:6:2. Which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But the options don't have this. Let me see:\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6 red checkered, 2 brown checkered, 6 red plain, 2 brown plain \u2192 This matches exactly! So the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which is equivalent to 3:1:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Yes, this matches the sum of checkered and plain for each trait.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as individual numbers without specifying whether they are checkered/brown or plain/other. So option A states the phenotypic ratio as 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, which sums up to 16. This would correspond to a ratio of 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But the options don't specify the order. However, option A presents the ratio correctly as 6, 2, 6, 2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the correct order might be checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option A fits that. Alternatively, some might interpret it differently, but according to the options, option A is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two phenotypes, each with a certain frequency.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are two phenotypes, each with a certain frequency. Since the genes are linked, but given the question doesn't specify linkage, I'll assume they assort independently. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for the F2 would be determined by the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, when considering multiple traits, the overall phenotype ratio is found by considering all possible combinations of the traits. Since each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypes, the total phenotypic ratio is the sum of all possible combinations. Alternatively, since each trait is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by looking at how many phenotypes result from each possible combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For the F2 generation:\n\nEach parent (F1) is CcBb. So, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: probability (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC Bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC bb: same as above?\nWait, no. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following probabilities based on independent assortment:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nBut since the genes are linked (assuming linkage reduces recombination frequency), the actual distribution might differ, but without specific information on recombination, I'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - Present (Red): 50% (CC + Cc)\n  - Absent (Plain): 50% (cc)\n  \n- Color (B):\n  - Present (Brown): 50% (BB + Bb)\n  - Absent (Checkered): 50% (bb)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. However, this isn't exactly right because each gene's outcome affects the phenotype. Instead, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, for each bird, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (Red) or absent (Plain), and whether B is present (Brown) or absent (Checkered).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C present, B present)\n2. Red Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain Checkered (C absent, B absent)\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to determine the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation will have 16 possible combinations of these phenotypes, each resulting from different combinations of the genes. However, calculating this manually could be time-consuming, but since the options are given, I can look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each gene is independently segregating, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of the dominant and recessive traits.\n\nGiven that each gene is dominant-recessive, the phenotypic ratios for each gene alone are 3:1. Combining two independent traits, the overall ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in this case, since both genes are contributing to the same bird, the phenotypic ratios will be more complex.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are expressed, then the phenotypic ratio depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Let me construct a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Allele | B Allele | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (C present, B present) | C present, B present | (Probability CC BB + Cc BB + CC Bb + Cc Bb)\nRed Checkered (C present, B absent) | C present, B absent | (Probability CC bb + Cc bb)\nPlain Brown (C absent, B present) | C absent, B present | (Probability cc BB + cc Bb)\nPlain Checkered (C absent, B absent) | C absent, B absent | (Probability cc bb)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Red Brown:\n   - CC BB: 25%\n   - Cc BB: 25%\n   - CC Bb: 25%\n   - Cc Bb: 25%\n   Total: 100% * (25+25+25+25)/16 = (100/16) = 6.25%\n\n2. Red Checkered:\n   - CC bb: 25%\n   - Cc bb: 25%\n   Total: 50/16 = 3.125%\n\n3. Plain Brown:\n   - cc BB: 25%\n   - cc Bb: 25%\n   Total: 50/16 = 3.125%\n\n4. Plain Checkered:\n   - cc bb: 25%\nTotal: 25/16 \u2248 1.5625%\n\nWait, but this gives a phenotypic ratio of approximately 6.25 : 3.125 : 3.125 : 1.5625, which simplifies to 25:10:10:4 when multiplied by 16. So the ratio is 25:10:10:4. Converting this to whole numbers by dividing by 4, we get 6.25:2.5:2.5:1, but this complicates things. Alternatively, recognizing that the total phenotypic ratio is 25 parts for Red Brown, 10 parts for Red Checkered, 10 parts for Plain Brown, and 4 parts for Plain Checkered. So the ratio is 25:10:10:4.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems off because according to our calculation, the plain checkered is 4 parts. Option G mentions checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't align. Option D suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Each gene's segregation is independent. For each bird, the probability of being Red is 50%, and the probability of being Checkered is 50%. Similarly, Brown is 50%, and plain is 50%.\n\nHowever, since both genes are expressed together, the phenotypic ratios aren't simply additive. Instead, it's better to consider all possible combinations. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown\n2. Red Checkered\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain Checkered\n\nTo find the exact counts, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nUsing the formula for independent genes:\n\n- P(Red) = P(C present) = 1/2\n- P(Brown) = P(B present) = 1/2\n\nThus, the joint probabilities are:\n\n1. Red Brown: P(R) * P(B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. Red Checkered: P(R) * P(not B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n3. Plain Brown: P(not R) * P(B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n4. Plain Checkered: P(not R) * P(not B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, but if each phenotype has a 25% chance, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but this contradicts the previous calculation where the ratio was 25:10:10:4. So clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion. In reality, the presence of both dominant alleles results in a particular phenotype, but when both genes are considered together, the phenotypic ratios don't split equally. For example, a bird with both dominant alleles (C and B) would appear as Red Brown, while a bird with one dominant and one recessive would appear as Red Checkered, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nPossible genotypes for each bird:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. CC BB (Wait, this is redundant\u2014it's already covered.)\n5. CC Bb (Again, redundant.)\n6. CC bb (Same as before.)\n\nActually, each bird will have a unique genotype based on the combination of alleles from each parent. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For the C gene: CC, Cc, or cc\n- For the B gene: BB, Bb, or bb\n\nCombining them, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n- CC bb (Plain Brown)\n- CC Bb (Same as above)\n- CC bb (Same)\n- And similar for other parents' contributions.\n\nWait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have four combinations of alleles for each gene, leading to nine possible genotypes, but with some overlapping due to dominance.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the Punnett square method for dihybrids. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible gametes:\n\n- CB (from Cc and BB)\n- cb (from Cc and bb)\n- cB (from cc and Bb)\n- cb (from cc and bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014since both parents are CcBb, the F2 will have gametes CB and cb. Thus, the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring at 25% probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n- cb x CB \u2192 cc BB (Plain Brown)\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nAnd the probabilities are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red Brown\n- CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but considering dominance, each phenotype may have different ratios. Wait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to one phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nIn this case, since each gene is expressed independently, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, but considering that having at least one dominant allele results in a particular phenotype, the counts would be equal across all phenotypes. Therefore, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, but scaled to 16 birds, giving 4 each. But this contradicts earlier thoughts where the ratio seemed to suggest different counts.\n\nThis indicates a misunderstanding. Actually, in dihybrid crosses with independent genes, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but this applies when the expression of both genes is considered together, leading to different phenotypes based on the combination of both genes. However, in this case, since each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, no\u2014when both genes are expressed, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the interaction of the two traits. For example, a bird with both dominant alleles (C and B) would express both traits, resulting in a specific phenotype, while a bird with one dominant and one recessive would express only one trait.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype. Let's calculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B (Red Brown) \u2192 Occurs in genotypes CC BB, CC Bb, cB BB, cB Bb\nWait, no\u2014correctly, the genotypes that result in both dominant alleles are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- cB BB\n- cB Bb\n\nWhich totals 4 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent (Red Checkered) \u2192 Genotypes CC bb, cB bb\n\nTotal 2 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present (Plain Brown) \u2192 Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb\n\nTotal 2 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent, B absent (Plain Checkered) \u2192 Genotype cc bb\n\nTotal 1 genotype.\n\nSo, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Scaling up to 16 birds, this becomes 8:4:4:2.\n\nBut wait, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nWait, none of the options directly match 8:4:4:2. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, cB BB, cB Bb \u2192 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 CC bb, cB bb \u2192 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent, B absent \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which sums to 9. To scale up to 16 birds, each category would be multiplied by 16/9, but since we need whole numbers, perhaps rounding isn't appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: The checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is heterozygous (Cc). Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is heterozygous (Cc). So the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the F2 would come from two F1 individuals crossing. So each F1 is CcBb. Their gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have four types of gametes, each 25%: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n- cb x CB \u2192 cc BB (Plain Brown)\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nEach of these happens with 25% probability. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1 when considering each bird individually. However, when considering the dominance of both traits, the phenotypes combine as follows:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant allele for both genes will exhibit both traits.\n- Birds with at least one dominant allele for one gene but not both will exhibit that trait.\n- Birds with neither dominant alleles will exhibit neither.\n\nBut in this case, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1, but the way the phenotypes are classified combines the effects of both genes. This means that the count of each phenotype will depend on how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nAs previously calculated, the ratio is 4:2:2:1 when considering each bird's genotype. Scaling this to 16 birds would give 8:4:4:2, which is not among the options. However, option C states a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance of both genes. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the problem considers only one gene's effect, ignoring the other. But the question explicitly asks about both genes, implying that both should be considered.\n\nGiven the options, none perfectly match the 4:2:2:1 ratio. The closest is option C, which assumes no dominance and thus a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but this doesn't account for both genes. Alternatively, option D suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which adds up to 16 birds with a 1:3:9:3 ratio, indicating a different approach, possibly considering dominance without interaction.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only one gene's effect, treating the other as dominant. For instance, if the color (B) is dominant over brown (b), and the pigment (C) is dominant over plain (c), then the phenotypes would be determined by whichever gene shows the dominant allele. However, this interpretation might lead to a different ratio.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypic ratio would be determined by which gene is dominant. Let's recalculate:\n\nEach bird will have either C or c and either B or b. The phenotypes are determined by which gene has the dominant allele. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (anywhere), regardless of B or b, the phenotype is Red.\n- If C is recessive (c), then checkered is determined by B or b.\n    - If B is dominant (anywhere), phenotype is Brown.\n    - If B is recessive, phenotype is plain.\n\nBut this interpretation might not be what the question expects, as it specifies checking both genes.\n\nGiven the confusion,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two phenotypes, each with a certain frequency. Since the genes are linked, but given the question doesn't specify linkage, I'll assume they assort independently. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for the F2 would be determined by the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, when considering multiple traits, the overall phenotype ratio is found by considering all possible combinations of the traits. Since each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypes, the total phenotypic ratio is the sum of all possible combinations. Alternatively, since each trait is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by looking at how many phenotypes result from each possible combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For the F2 generation:\n\nEach parent (F1) is CcBb. So, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: probability (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC Bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC bb: same as above?\nWait, no. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following probabilities based on independent assortment:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nBut since the genes are linked (assuming linkage reduces recombination frequency), the actual distribution might differ, but without specific information on recombination, I'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - Present (Red): 50% (CC + Cc)\n  - Absent (Plain): 50% (cc)\n  \n- Color (B):\n  - Present (Brown): 50% (BB + Bb)\n  - Absent (Checkered): 50% (bb)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. However, this isn't exactly right because each gene's outcome affects the phenotype. Instead, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, for each bird, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (Red) or absent (Plain), and whether B is present (Brown) or absent (Checkered).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C present, B present)\n2. Red Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain Checkered (C absent, B absent)\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to determine the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation will have 16 possible combinations of these phenotypes, each resulting from different combinations of the genes. However, calculating this manually could be time-consuming, but since the options are given, I can look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each gene is independently segregating, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of the dominant and recessive traits.\n\nGiven that each gene is dominant-recessive, the phenotypic ratios for each gene alone are 3:1. Combining two independent traits, the overall ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in this case, since both genes are contributing to the same bird, the phenotypic ratios will be more complex.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are expressed, then the phenotypic ratio depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Let me construct a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Allele | B Allele | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (C present, B present) | C present, B present | (Probability CC BB + Cc BB + CC Bb + Cc Bb)\nRed Checkered (C present, B absent) | C present, B absent | (Probability CC bb + Cc bb)\nPlain Brown (C absent, B present) | C absent, B present | (Probability cc BB + cc Bb)\nPlain Checkered (C absent, B absent) | C absent, B absent | (Probability cc bb)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Red Brown:\n   - CC BB: 25%\n   - Cc BB: 25%\n   - CC Bb: 25%\n   - Cc Bb: 25%\n   Total: 100% * (25+25+25+25)/16 = (100/16) = 6.25%\n\n2. Red Checkered:\n   - CC bb: 25%\n   - Cc bb: 25%\n   Total: 50/16 = 3.125%\n\n3. Plain Brown:\n   - cc BB: 25%\n   - cc Bb: 25%\n   Total: 50/16 = 3.125%\n\n4. Plain Checkered:\n   - cc bb: 25%\nTotal: 25/16 \u2248 1.5625%\n\nWait, but this gives a phenotypic ratio of approximately 6.25 : 3.125 : 3.125 : 1.5625, which simplifies to 25:10:10:4 when multiplied by 16. So the ratio is 25:10:10:4. Converting this to whole numbers by dividing by 4, we get 6.25:2.5:2.5:1, but this complicates things. Alternatively, recognizing that the total phenotypic ratio is 25 parts for Red Brown, 10 parts for Red Checkered, 10 parts for Plain Brown, and 4 parts for Plain Checkered. So the ratio is 25:10:10:4.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems off because according to our calculation, the plain checkered is 4 parts. Option G mentions checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't align. Option D suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Each gene's segregation is independent. For each bird, the probability of being Red is 50%, and the probability of being Checkered is 50%. Similarly, Brown is 50%, and plain is 50%.\n\nHowever, since both genes are expressed together, the phenotypic ratios aren't simply additive. Instead, it's better to consider all possible combinations. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown\n2. Red Checkered\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain Checkered\n\nTo find the exact counts, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nUsing the formula for independent genes:\n\n- P(Red) = P(C present) = 1/2\n- P(Brown) = P(B present) = 1/2\n\nThus, the joint probabilities are:\n\n1. Red Brown: P(R) * P(B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. Red Checkered: P(R) * P(not B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n3. Plain Brown: P(not R) * P(B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n4. Plain Checkered: P(not R) * P(not B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, but if each phenotype has a 25% chance, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but this contradicts the previous calculation where the ratio was 25:10:10:4. So clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion. In reality, the presence of both dominant alleles results in a particular phenotype, but when both genes are considered together, the phenotypic ratios don't split equally. For example, a bird with both dominant alleles (C and B) would appear as Red Brown, while a bird with one dominant and one recessive would appear as Red Checkered, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nPossible genotypes for each bird:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. CC BB (Wait, this is redundant\u2014it's already covered.)\n5. CC Bb (Again, redundant.)\n6. CC bb (Same as before.)\n\nActually, each bird will have a unique genotype based on the combination of alleles from each parent. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For the C gene: CC, Cc, or cc\n- For the B gene: BB, Bb, or bb\n\nCombining them, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n- CC bb (Plain Brown)\n- CC Bb (Same as above)\n- CC bb (Same)\n- And similar for other parents' contributions.\n\nWait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have four combinations of alleles for each gene, leading to nine possible genotypes, but with some overlapping due to dominance.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the Punnett square method for dihybrids. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible gametes:\n\n- CB (from Cc and BB)\n- cb (from Cc and bb)\n- cB (from cc and Bb)\n- cb (from cc and bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014since both parents are CcBb, the F2 will have gametes CB and cb. Thus, the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring at 25% probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n- cb x CB \u2192 cc BB (Plain Brown)\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nAnd the probabilities are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red Brown\n- CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but considering dominance, each phenotype may have different ratios. Wait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to one phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nIn this case, since each gene is expressed independently, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, but considering that having at least one dominant allele results in a particular phenotype, the counts would be equal across all phenotypes. Therefore, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, but scaled to 16 birds, giving 4 each. But this contradicts earlier thoughts where the ratio seemed to suggest different counts.\n\nThis indicates a misunderstanding. Actually, in dihybrid crosses with independent genes, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but this applies when the expression of both genes is considered together, leading to different phenotypes based on the combination of both genes. However, in this case, since each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, no\u2014when both genes are expressed, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the interaction of the two traits. For example, a bird with both dominant alleles (C and B) would express both traits, resulting in a specific phenotype, while a bird with one dominant and one recessive would express only one trait.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype. Let's calculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B (Red Brown) \u2192 Occurs in genotypes CC BB, CC Bb, cB BB, cB Bb\nWait, no\u2014correctly, the genotypes that result in both dominant alleles are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- cB BB\n- cB Bb\n\nWhich totals 4 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent (Red Checkered) \u2192 Genotypes CC bb, cB bb\n\nTotal 2 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present (Plain Brown) \u2192 Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb\n\nTotal 2 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent, B absent (Plain Checkered) \u2192 Genotype cc bb\n\nTotal 1 genotype.\n\nSo, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Scaling up to 16 birds, this becomes 8:4:4:2.\n\nBut wait, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nWait, none of the options directly match 8:4:4:2. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, cB BB, cB Bb \u2192 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 CC bb, cB bb \u2192 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent, B absent \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which sums to 9. To scale up to 16 birds, each category would be multiplied by 16/9, but since we need whole numbers, perhaps rounding isn't appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: The checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is heterozygous (Cc). Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is heterozygous (Cc). So the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the F2 would come from two F1 individuals crossing. So each F1 is CcBb. Their gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have four types of gametes, each 25%: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n- cb x CB \u2192 cc BB (Plain Brown)\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nEach of these happens with 25% probability. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1 when considering each bird individually. However, when considering the dominance of both traits, the phenotypes combine as follows:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant allele for both genes will exhibit both traits.\n- Birds with at least one dominant allele for one gene but not both will exhibit that trait.\n- Birds with neither dominant alleles will exhibit neither.\n\nBut in this case, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1, but the way the phenotypes are classified combines the effects of both genes. This means that the count of each phenotype will depend on how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nAs previously calculated, the ratio is 4:2:2:1 when considering each bird's genotype. Scaling this to 16 birds would give 8:4:4:2, which is not among the options. However, option C states a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance of both genes. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the problem considers only one gene's effect, ignoring the other. But the question explicitly asks about both genes, implying that both should be considered.\n\nGiven the options, none perfectly match the 4:2:2:1 ratio. The closest is option C, which assumes no dominance and thus a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but this doesn't account for both genes. Alternatively, option D suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which adds up to 16 birds with a 1:3:9:3 ratio, indicating a different approach, possibly considering dominance without interaction.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only one gene's effect, treating the other as dominant. For instance, if the color (B) is dominant over brown (b), and the pigment (C) is dominant over plain (c), then the phenotypes would be determined by whichever gene shows the dominant allele. However, this interpretation might lead to a different ratio.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypic ratio would be determined by which gene is dominant. Let's recalculate:\n\nEach bird will have either C or c and either B or b. The phenotypes are determined by which gene has the dominant allele. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (anywhere), regardless of B or b, the phenotype is Red.\n- If C is recessive (c), then checkered is determined by B or b.\n    - If B is dominant (anywhere), phenotype is Brown.\n    - If B is recessive, phenotype is plain.\n\nBut this interpretation might not be what the question expects, as it specifies checking both genes.\n\nGiven the confusion,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

However, some may overlap, but in reality, since the genes are independent, each combination is possible.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. If each gene has two options, then for two genes, there are 2^2 = 4 phenotypic categories, but if each gene has three phenotypic expressions (like presence and absence of pigment and color), then it's different. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c), and two alleles for color (B and b). Each gene has two possible phenotypic outcomes.

Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo in terms of counts, assuming 100% F2 population:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 25\n- Checkered brown: 50% \u2192 50\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 25\n\nBut looking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also doesn't match. Option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Not matching.

Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the percentages. Let me double-check. The F2 generation has four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (because C is present, b is recessive but B is present)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both c and b)\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution should be 25% checkered red, 50% checkered brown, 25% plain brown. But none of the options match this exact distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the entire F2 generation but rather a particular subset. Alternatively, maybe the options are based on considering only the F1 generation. But the question specifically asks for F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of F2 individuals. Let me assume a larger population, say 100 birds, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 25 checkered red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 50 checkered brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 25 plain brown\n\nTotal: 100\n\nBut the options don't include 25 checkered red, 50 checkered brown, etc. Perhaps the options are simplified or rounded differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question considers that the F1 (CcBb) is selfing, leading to F2, but the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some phenotypes may combine due to multiple traits.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's separate traits. So, for each bird, the two traits are independent. So, the phenotypic ratio should reflect the sum of the percentages for each phenotype.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nIf the total number of birds is N, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 0.25N\n- Checkered brown: 0.50N\n- Plain brown: 0.25N\n\nBut since none of the options directly match this, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each trait is expressed in a certain way, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total is 16, which is less than 100. Option H: 5+3=8; 2+6=8; 6+3=9; 2+6=8. Total 25, but again, not matching.\n\nOption F: 4+4=8; 4+4=8; 4+4=12; 4+4=8.

Total 20.\n\nOption D: 1+3=4; 3+9=12; 9+3=12; 3+1=4. Total 32.\n\nOption E: 3+9=12; 9+1=10; 1+3=4; 3+3=6. Total 30.\n\nOption I: 7+5=12; 5+3=8; 3+1=4; 1+3=4. Total 28.\n\nOption J: 2+6=8; 6+3=9; 3+1=4; 1+1=2. Total 24.\n\nNone of these sums to 100 except possibly option G if it's 12+2+2+0=16, but still not 100.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a different scenario where not all F2 birds are present, such as considering only the F1 generation, but that doesn't make sense because F2 is the next generation after F1 selfing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait per bird, but that contradicts the description.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I'll look back at the original question and the options provided.\n\nThe original question describes the F2 generation, so the correct answer must be among the options that reflect the 25%, 50%, and 25% distribution. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing these gives 16, which is less than 100. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16.\n\nOption I: 7+5=12; 5+3=8; 3+1=4; 1+3=4. Total 28.\n\nOption J: 2+6=8; 6+3=9; 3+1=4; 1+1=2. Sum 24.\n\nOption D: 1+3=4; 3+9=12; 9+3=12; 3+1=4. Sum 32.\n\nOption B: 8+4=12; 4+4=8; 0+4=4; 4+4=8. Sum 24.\n\nOption C: 9+3=12; 3+3=6; 1+1=2; 1+3=4. Sum 20.\n\nOption A: 6+2=8; 2+6=8; 6+2=8; 2+6=8. Sum 24.\n\nHmm, none of them add up to 100. This suggests that either the question is expecting approximate rounding or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the genetic model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different scenario, such as considering that both genes are active, and thus, the phenotypes are determined by both genes together, but the options don't account for that.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is using the term \"phenotypic ratio\" in a simplified way, focusing only on the most common phenotypes without considering dominance or recessiveness. But that wouldn't align with standard genetic terminology.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should re-examine the initial approach. The key is that each gene acts independently, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. In the F2 generation, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the Mendelian ratios for each gene, multiplied together.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should reflect the combined probabilities of each gene's presence. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n- C present and B absent \u2192 Checkered brown (50%)\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 25:50:25, or simplified, 1:2:1. But none of the options reflect this. Instead, the options list specific numbers, suggesting that the question might be counting a smaller sample or there's an error in the options.\n\nUpon reviewing, perhaps the user intended for the options to represent the counts for a particular scenario, such as considering only the F1 generation, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included a typo in the options. Given that, I might choose the closest option, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's calculate the number of each phenotype in a hypothetical F2 population of 100 birds.\n\n- CC BB: 25 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: 50 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, in a 100 bird population:\n\n- Checkered red: 25\n- Checkered brown: 50\n- Plain brown: 25\n\nBut none of the options provide these numbers. However, option G states Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This adds up to 16, which is far from 100. Option H totals 16 as well. Option I totals 28, and others lower.\n\nPerhaps the question is implying a different scenario, like considering only one of the genes, but that contradicts the description.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm unsure why. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Without further information, I might have to conclude that the correct ratio isn't listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the question is considering only the F1 generation, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a different question, and the options were misassigned.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the standard Mendelian inheritance, the phenotypic ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, and 25% Plain brown. None of the options reflect this exactly, so perhaps the closest answer is option G, even though it doesn't match the total count. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nHowever, since I have to choose an answer, I'll go with option G, recognizing that it might not perfectly match the 25:50:25 ratio but could be the intended choice based on potential rounding or simplification.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo, for the C locus, the possible phenotypes are red or plain. Similarly, for the B locus, they are brown or checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on how many individuals have each phenotype. Each gene is segregating into three parts, but since we're dealing with two genes, each with two alleles, there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible phenotypic categories. However, some may overlap, but in reality, since the genes are independent, each combination is possible.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. If each gene has two options, then for two genes, there are 2^2 = 4 phenotypic categories, but if each gene has three phenotypic expressions (like presence and absence of pigment and color), then it's different. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c), and two alleles for color (B and b). Each gene has two possible phenotypic outcomes. So for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: presence (C) \u2192 red; absence (c) \u2192 plain\n- Color: presence (B) \u2192 brown; absence (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the phenotypes combine. So the total number of phenotypic classes is 2 x 2 = 4. However, the actual phenotypic ratios are determined by the segregation of each gene.\n\nBut wait, the question seems to ask for the ratio of the specific phenotypes mentioned in the options: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps the answer expects us to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being any of these.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo the four F2 genotypes are: CC BB (25%), CcBb (50%), and cc bb (25%). Now, converting these genotypes into phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- CC \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele), then pigment is red.\n- If B is present (any B allele), then color is brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present, then the phenotype is checkered (since c and b are both absent).\n\nNow, let's consider each F2 bird:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both C and B are present. Pigment is red, color is brown. Phenotype: checkered red.\n2. **CcBb**: C is present (Cc), B is present (Bb). Pigment is red, color is brown. Phenotype: checkered brown.\n3. **CcBb**: Same as above. Phenotype: checkered brown.\n4. **cc bb**: Neither C nor B is present. Phenotype: plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

That doesn't add up. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also doesn't match.

Option G has 12,2,2,0. Not matching. Option H matches approximately but not exactly. Option I has 7,5,1,3. Not matching. Option J has 2,6,3,1. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the percentages. Let me double-check. The F2 generation has four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (because C is present, b is recessive but B is present)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both c and b)\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution should be 25% checkered red, 50% checkered brown, 25% plain brown. But none of the options match this exact distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the entire F2 generation but rather a particular subset. Alternatively, maybe the options are based on considering only the F1 generation. But the question specifically asks for F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of F2 individuals.

Instead, the options list specific numbers, suggesting that the question might be counting a smaller sample or there's an error in the options.\n\nUpon reviewing, perhaps the user intended for the options to represent the counts for a particular scenario, such as considering only the F1 generation, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included a typo in the options. Given that, I might choose the closest option, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's calculate the number of each phenotype in a hypothetical F2 population of 100 birds.\n\n- CC BB: 25 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: 50 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, in a 100 bird population:\n\n- Checkered red: 25\n- Checkered brown: 50\n- Plain brown: 25\n\nBut none of the options provide these numbers. However, option G states Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This adds up to 16, which is far from 100. Option H totals 16 as well. Option I totals 28, and others lower.\n\nPerhaps the question is implying a different scenario, like considering only one of the genes, but that contradicts the description.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm unsure why. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Without further information, I might have to conclude that the correct ratio isn't listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the question is considering only the F1 generation, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a different question, and the options were misassigned.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the standard Mendelian inheritance, the phenotypic ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, and 25% Plain brown. None of the options reflect this exactly, so perhaps the closest answer is option G, even though it doesn't match the total count. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nHowever, since I have to choose an answer, I'll go with option G, recognizing that it might not perfectly match the 25:50:25 ratio but could be the intended choice based on potential rounding or simplification.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio if we consider the dominance.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio if we consider the dominance. But since we're dealing with two loci, the total phenotypic ratios would be (number of phenotypes) = 3\u00d73=9. So each phenotype corresponds to a combination of the presence or absence of C and B. Now, the key is to determine how many of the 9 possible phenotypes occur in the F2.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the options A to H. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (CcBb)**: This phenotype requires both dominant alleles for both genes. From the F2, this occurs when C is present (so either C or cc) and B is present (either B or bb). How does this translate into counts? In terms of the 9 possible phenotypes, this is one category. Alternatively, looking at the phenotypic ratios given in the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because 12+2+2=16, which exceeds 18 (the sum of 9 phenotypes multiplied by 2 each?), but perhaps my approach is flawed. Maybe better to look at the actual calculations instead of relying solely on the answer choices.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has a 2:1 ratio for presence and absence, but since dominance complicates things, the overall ratio isn't straightforward. Instead, considering the independent assortment and the dominance, the phenotypic ratios can be derived by counting the possible combinations where each gene contributes to the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of each gene contributing to the phenotype. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- For Pigmentation (Gene C):\n  - Presence (C): Red\n  - Absence (c): Plain\n\n- For Color (Gene B):\n  - Presence (B): Brown\n  - Absence (b): Checkered\n\nSince these are independent, the phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CcBb)\n2. Checkered Brown (CcBb)\n3. Plain Red (ccBb)\n4. Plain Brown (ccbb)\n\nBut wait, hold on. No, because in reality, the presence of C doesn't necessarily mean red unless B is also present. Similarly, the presence of B doesn't make it brown unless C is present. So the actual phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (regardless of B) and whether B is present (regardless of C).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered Red (C B)\n- C present, B absent: Checkered Brown (C b)\n- C absent, B present: Plain Red (c B)\n- Both C and B absent: Plain Brown (c b)\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C present (C_B or C_bb): Wait, no, because presence depends on B as well. Hmm, this might require a different approach.\n\nLet me think in terms of independent assortment. Since the two genes are on separate chromosomes, the segregation is independent. So the possible phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the possible combinations for each gene.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for presence vs absence, but dominance affects the outcome. Wait, no. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele results in the respective phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So, for the C locus, presence leads to red, absence leads to plain. Similarly for B.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios for each gene are 3:1, leading to a total of 9 possible phenotypes (3x3). The actual distribution in the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nHowever, since both genes are acting independently and are being considered here, the F2 phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Number of Checkered Red: 9/16 of the population (since 3^2=9, and total is 16, but wait, that's not accurate)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me use a Punnett square approach.\n\nParental cross: Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) \u00d7 Homozygous plain brown (cc bb). All offspring from this cross must be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So all F1 individuals are CcBb, and then they self to produce F2.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo now, the F2 phenotypes are equally distributed across the four categories. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. But wait, this contradicts some of the answer choices. Looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"phenotypic ratio,\" so the actual count per phenotype. If all four phenotypes are equally represented, each would have 25% of the F2 population. But the options don't reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Total 12\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Total 16\n\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Total 12\n\nK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nWait, I see that the options include sums like 12, 16, etc. Perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio expressed as the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, rather than the absolute numbers.\n\nIf that's the case, then in F2, each phenotype (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown) occurs 25% of the time, so their proportions would be 25%, 25%, 25%, 25%. But none of the options list 25% for any. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio without normalization.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C says Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing up to 16, which matches the F2 population size. Option D is 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. None of them perfectly represent the 25:25:25:25 ratio, but perhaps the way the phenotypes are defined differs.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic ratios. Let me think again. The F2 population consists of four types:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (25%)\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (25%)\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nSo each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options reflect this exact ratio. Option K is 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, but scaled by 4. So if each phenotype is represented once in a group of 16, then 4 of each would make sense, making option K correct. But the options don't have K. Wait, looking back, the user didn't provide an option K, but in the list, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option D is 1,3,9,3, adding to 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, same sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the possible phenotypic ratios. Another approach: Each gene has three possible states (presence or absence) for each trait, but dominance complicates the ratio. However, in F2, since both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which translates to a total of 16 parts. So the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't directly present this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16. Yes, this aligns with 9:3:3:1. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the F2 was equally distributed, but according to the 9:3:3:1 rule, it's not. Let me clarify: The 9:3:3:1 ratio refers to the phenotypic distribution when two traits are segregating independently and are completely dominant. So in our case, since both genes are acting independently, the F2 would follow this ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Option C is 9,3,3,1, same sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the possible phenotypic ratios. Another approach: Each gene has three possible states (presence or absence) for each trait, but dominance complicates the ratio. However, in F2, since both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which translates to a total of 16 parts. So the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't directly present this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16. Yes, this aligns with 9:3:3:1. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the F2 was equally distributed, but according to the 9:3:3:1 rule, it's not. Let me clarify: The 9:3:3:1 ratio refers to the phenotypic distribution when two traits are segregating independently and are completely dominant. So in our case, since both genes are acting independently, the F2 would follow this ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming each gene is segregating independently.",
    "rollout": " Assuming each gene is segregating independently.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: all C and all B \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb: all C and some B \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb: all C and none B \u2192 red checkered\n- CC bb: same as above?\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Presence (C) \u2192 red\n- Absence (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Presence (B) \u2192 brown\n- Absence (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince these genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all combinations where C is either present or not, and B is either present or not. So there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation?\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for pigment:\n\n- 25% C present (C)\n- 75% C absent (c)\n\nFor color:\n\n- 25% B present (B)\n- 75% B absent (b)\n\nSo the total phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- All C and B present: 25% (red brown)\n- C present, B absent: 25% (red checkered)\n- C absent, B present: 25% (plain brown)\n- C absent, B absent: 25% (plain checkered)\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the ratio of the phenotypes as described in the options. Looking back, the options provided are A to H, each giving a different ratio. For example, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems like a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which fits if each gene segregates into a 3:1 ratio for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that for each gene, the segregation is 3:1 (dominant: recessive), leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combination of two traits. Wait, but that might not directly apply here because the traits are for two separate genes. Actually, each gene contributes to the overall phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation would be a 9:3:3:1 distribution for each gene, but combined across both genes.\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotype counts.\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Checkered red (C c and B b): This would be represented by the genotype cc bb. How many such individuals are there? Each parent produces gametes CB and cb, so the F2 would have:\n\n    - 25% CC BB (red brown)\n    - 25% CC Bb (red brown)\n    - 25% CC bb (red checkered)\n    - 25% Cc BB (checkered brown)\n    - 25% Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n    - 25% Cc bb (checkered checkered)\n    - 25% cc BB (plain brown)\n    - 25% cc Bb (plain brown)\n    - 25% cc bb (plain checkered)\n    - 25% cC BB (same as Cc BB)\n    - Etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nParental F1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nGametes from each parent:\n\n- From C locus: 50% C, 50% c\n- From B locus: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo F1 produces gametes:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- Cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nThus, F2 will have four types of gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 Cb = Cc (50%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB = Cc (another 25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (another 25%)\nSimilarly for other combinations, but since all parents are the same, it simplifies to:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame goes for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (red brown)\n- 25% CC bb (red checkered)\n- 25% Cc BB (checkered brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- 25% Cc bb (checkered checkered)\n- 25% cc BB (plain brown)\n- 25% cc Bb (plain brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both genes are dominant \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigmented dominant, color recessive \u2192 red checkered\n3. CC bb: Pigmented dominant, color dominant \u2192 red brown (since B is dominant over b)\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if B is dominant, then any presence of B results in brown, regardless of whether B is dominant or recessive. Similarly, any c (recessive) results in plain for pigment. Same with B: any presence of B results in brown, regardless of B being dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- If both C and B are present (i.e., C and B are dominant), the phenotype is red brown.\n- If C is present but B is recessive, the phenotype is red checkered.\n- If C is recessive and B is present, the phenotype is plain brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive, the phenotype is plain checkered.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if B is present (B), the bird is brown. If B is absent (b), it's checkered. Similarly for C. So each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present or not.\n\nSo in terms of the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- Both C and B present: red brown\n- C present, B absent: red checkered\n- C absent, B present: plain brown\n- Both C and B absent: plain checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype occur in the F2:\n\n- Both C and B present: 25% (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb?) Wait, no. Let me see: the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb: C present (red), B absent (checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n- CC bb: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc BB: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb: C present (red), B absent (checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB: C absent (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb: C absent (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb: C absent (plain), B absent (checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: CC BB (1/4), CC Bb (1/4), Cc BB (1/4), Cc Bb (1/4), Cc bb (1/4) \u2192 Total 5/8\nWait, but that's 5/8, which doesn't match any given options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Each F2 genotype is 25%, so:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- CC Bb \u2192 red checkered (1/4)\n- CC bb \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red checkered (1/4)\n- Cc bb \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown (1/4)\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (1/4)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered (1/4)\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Red Brown: 5/8 (since CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb are all red brown)\n- Red Checkered: 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 2/8 (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain Checkered: 1/8\n\nWait, that adds up to 5+1+2+1=9 parts out of 16. Hmm, maybe my earlier calculation was off.\n\nActually, let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 population: 4x4 = 16 genotypes.\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown: Genotypes where C and B are both present \u2192 4 cases (all except those with c or b)\nWait, no. Let me list them:\n\n- CC BB: Red Brown\n- CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- CC bb: Red Brown\n- Cc BB: Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red Checkered\n- Cc bb: Red Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 cases (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb) \u2192 4/16 = 1/4\n- Red Checkered: 1 case (CC Bb) \u2192 1/16\n- Plain Brown: 2 cases (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Checkered: 1 case (cc bb) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, but according to the options provided, none of them match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. ... 6, 2, 2, 6\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.9,3,3,1\n\nM.1,3,9,3\n\nN.7,5,1,3\n\nO.5,3,2,6\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match what I've calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe I should consider dominance differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation as having a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combination.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each gene segregates independently, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the product of the ratios for each gene. For pigment (C/B), the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant to recessive). Similarly, for color (B/b), it's also 3:1. So the combined phenotypic ratio is (3:1) \u00d7 (3:1) = 9:3:3:1, but distributed among the four phenotypes as follows:\n\n- Both dominant: 3\u00d73 = 9\n- C dominant, B recessive: 3\u00d71 = 3\n- C recessive, B dominant: 1\u00d73 = 3\n- Both recessive: 1\u00d71 = 1\n\nThese correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red (C c and B b): 9\n- Checkered brown (C c and b B): 3\n- Plain brown (c C and B b): 3\n- Plain checkered (c c and b B): 1\n\nWhich matches option L: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 'checkered red' as one of the first four. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption K: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Wait, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color rather than the gene. Wait, checking the original question: \"the checkered pattern... controlled by a dominant gene C\". So the color is determined by gene B. The term \"checkered\" probably refers to the color, i.e., when both B and b are present, resulting in brown. Wait, no, \"checkered\" might refer to the pattern, but the dominant gene C controls the pigment color. So perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color being brown, while \"plain\" refers to checkered (but that doesn't make sense).\n\nWait, perhaps \"checkered\" is used interchangeably with \"brown.\" Let me re-examine the question. The original question states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the color is determined by B (dominant) for brown and b (recessive) for plain. The checkered pattern is due to the C gene. So, in terms of color, \"checkered\" might not be a standard term, but perhaps the question uses it to mean brown. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color, meaning brown. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" is a misnomer and refers to the pattern, but I'll proceed under the assumption that \"checkered\" refers to brown, and \"plain\" refers to checkered.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 3\u00d73 =9\n- Checkered brown: C present (red) and B absent (brown) \u2192 3\u00d71=3\n- Plain brown: C absent (plain) and B present (brown) \u21921\u00d73=3\n- Plain checkered: C absent (plain) and B absent (brown) \u21921\u00d71=1\n\nWait, but according to this, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain brown, plain checkered. But the options don't have this exact phrasing. Option K says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as the recessive phenotype, i.e., plain, and \"plain\" as checkered. That would flip the terms. So, let me recast:\n\n- Checkered (plain): C absent, B absent \u2192 1\u00d71=1\n- Checkered brown: C absent, B present \u21921\u00d73=3\n- Plain brown: C present, B present \u21923\u00d71=3\n- Plain (checkered): C present, B absent \u21923\u00d73=9\n\nWait, but that still leads to the same ratio, but flipped. If \"checkered\" is considered as plain (C absent, B absent), then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:9, which isn't listed in the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses \"checkered\" to refer to the presence of both C and B alleles, making the dominant phenotype appear as \"checkered,\" but that contradicts the usual terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the options provided. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, implying 12 instances of one phenotype, 2 of another, etc. That could happen if all the F2 are either red or brown, but that doesn't align with our previous analysis.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross without considering the actual segregation patterns, treating it as a simple 9:3:3:1 ratio. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. That doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option K suggests 12 checkered red, which is too high. Option M is 4,4,4,4, which doesn't fit. Option N is 7,5,1,3, which is similar to 9:3:3:1 but slightly different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the initial setup. The F1 cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute CB or cb gametes. Thus, F1 is all CcBb. Then, the F2 would involve the selfing of CcBb, producing F2 genotypes.\n\nWait, but another thought: If the F1 is indeed CcBb, then when selfed, the expected F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the two traits. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes, which corresponds to:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, option L is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up because checkered brown and plain brown are both brown, whereas checkered red and plain checkered are red.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering \"checkered\" as the color, meaning brown, and \"plain\" as the other phenotype, meaning red. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered (brown):",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming each gene is segregating independently.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: all C and all B \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb: all C and some B \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb: all C and none B \u2192 red checkered\n- CC bb: same as above?\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Presence (C) \u2192 red\n- Absence (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Presence (B) \u2192 brown\n- Absence (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince these genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all combinations where C is either present or not, and B is either present or not. So there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation?\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for pigment:\n\n- 25% C present (C)\n- 75% C absent (c)\n\nFor color:\n\n- 25% B present (B)\n- 75% B absent (b)\n\nSo the total phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- All C and B present: 25% (red brown)\n- C present, B absent: 25% (red checkered)\n- C absent, B present: 25% (plain brown)\n- C absent, B absent: 25% (plain checkered)\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the ratio of the phenotypes as described in the options. Looking back, the options provided are A to H, each giving a different ratio. For example, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems like a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which fits if each gene segregates into a 3:1 ratio for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that for each gene, the segregation is 3:1 (dominant: recessive), leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combination of two traits. Wait, but that might not directly apply here because the traits are for two separate genes. Actually, each gene contributes to the overall phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation would be a 9:3:3:1 distribution for each gene, but combined across both genes.\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotype counts.\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Checkered red (C c and B b): This would be represented by the genotype cc bb. How many such individuals are there? Each parent produces gametes CB and cb, so the F2 would have:\n\n    - 25% CC BB (red brown)\n    - 25% CC Bb (red brown)\n    - 25% CC bb (red checkered)\n    - 25% Cc BB (checkered brown)\n    - 25% Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n    - 25% Cc bb (checkered checkered)\n    - 25% cc BB (plain brown)\n    - 25% cc Bb (plain brown)\n    - 25% cc bb (plain checkered)\n    - 25% cC BB (same as Cc BB)\n    - Etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nParental F1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nGametes from each parent:\n\n- From C locus: 50% C, 50% c\n- From B locus: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo F1 produces gametes:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- Cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nThus, F2 will have four types of gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 Cb = Cc (50%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB = Cc (another 25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (another 25%)\nSimilarly for other combinations, but since all parents are the same, it simplifies to:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame goes for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (red brown)\n- 25% CC bb (red checkered)\n- 25% Cc BB (checkered brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- 25% Cc bb (checkered checkered)\n- 25% cc BB (plain brown)\n- 25% cc Bb (plain brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both genes are dominant \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigmented dominant, color recessive \u2192 red checkered\n3. CC bb: Pigmented dominant, color dominant \u2192 red brown (since B is dominant over b)\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if B is dominant, then any presence of B results in brown, regardless of whether B is dominant or recessive. Similarly, any c (recessive) results in plain for pigment. Same with B: any presence of B results in brown, regardless of B being dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- If both C and B are present (i.e., C and B are dominant), the phenotype is red brown.\n- If C is present but B is recessive, the phenotype is red checkered.\n- If C is recessive and B is present, the phenotype is plain brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive, the phenotype is plain checkered.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if B is present (B), the bird is brown. If B is absent (b), it's checkered. Similarly for C. So each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present or not.\n\nSo in terms of the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- Both C and B present: red brown\n- C present, B absent: red checkered\n- C absent, B present: plain brown\n- Both C and B absent: plain checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype occur in the F2:\n\n- Both C and B present: 25% (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb?) Wait, no. Let me see: the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb: C present (red), B absent (checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n- CC bb: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc BB: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb: C present (red), B absent (checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB: C absent (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb: C absent (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb: C absent (plain), B absent (checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: CC BB (1/4), CC Bb (1/4), Cc BB (1/4), Cc Bb (1/4), Cc bb (1/4) \u2192 Total 5/8\nWait, but that's 5/8, which doesn't match any given options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Each F2 genotype is 25%, so:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- CC Bb \u2192 red checkered (1/4)\n- CC bb \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red checkered (1/4)\n- Cc bb \u2192 red brown (1/4)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown (1/4)\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (1/4)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered (1/4)\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Red Brown: 5/8 (since CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb are all red brown)\n- Red Checkered: 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 2/8 (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain Checkered: 1/8\n\nWait, that adds up to 5+1+2+1=9 parts out of 16. Hmm, maybe my earlier calculation was off.\n\nActually, let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 population: 4x4 = 16 genotypes.\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown: Genotypes where C and B are both present \u2192 4 cases (all except those with c or b)\nWait, no. Let me list them:\n\n- CC BB: Red Brown\n- CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- CC bb: Red Brown\n- Cc BB: Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red Checkered\n- Cc bb: Red Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 cases (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb) \u2192 4/16 = 1/4\n- Red Checkered: 1 case (CC Bb) \u2192 1/16\n- Plain Brown: 2 cases (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Checkered: 1 case (cc bb) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, but according to the options provided, none of them match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. ... 6, 2, 2, 6\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.9,3,3,1\n\nM.1,3,9,3\n\nN.7,5,1,3\n\nO.5,3,2,6\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match what I've calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe I should consider dominance differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation as having a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combination.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each gene segregates independently, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the product of the ratios for each gene. For pigment (C/B), the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant to recessive). Similarly, for color (B/b), it's also 3:1. So the combined phenotypic ratio is (3:1) \u00d7 (3:1) = 9:3:3:1, but distributed among the four phenotypes as follows:\n\n- Both dominant: 3\u00d73 = 9\n- C dominant, B recessive: 3\u00d71 = 3\n- C recessive, B dominant: 1\u00d73 = 3\n- Both recessive: 1\u00d71 = 1\n\nThese correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red (C c and B b): 9\n- Checkered brown (C c and b B): 3\n- Plain brown (c C and B b): 3\n- Plain checkered (c c and b B): 1\n\nWhich matches option L: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 'checkered red' as one of the first four. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption K: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Wait, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color rather than the gene. Wait, checking the original question: \"the checkered pattern... controlled by a dominant gene C\". So the color is determined by gene B. The term \"checkered\" probably refers to the color, i.e., when both B and b are present, resulting in brown. Wait, no, \"checkered\" might refer to the pattern, but the dominant gene C controls the pigment color. So perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color being brown, while \"plain\" refers to checkered (but that doesn't make sense).\n\nWait, perhaps \"checkered\" is used interchangeably with \"brown.\" Let me re-examine the question. The original question states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the color is determined by B (dominant) for brown and b (recessive) for plain. The checkered pattern is due to the C gene. So, in terms of color, \"checkered\" might not be a standard term, but perhaps the question uses it to mean brown. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color, meaning brown. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" is a misnomer and refers to the pattern, but I'll proceed under the assumption that \"checkered\" refers to brown, and \"plain\" refers to checkered.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 3\u00d73 =9\n- Checkered brown: C present (red) and B absent (brown) \u2192 3\u00d71=3\n- Plain brown: C absent (plain) and B present (brown) \u21921\u00d73=3\n- Plain checkered: C absent (plain) and B absent (brown) \u21921\u00d71=1\n\nWait, but according to this, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain brown, plain checkered. But the options don't have this exact phrasing. Option K says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as the recessive phenotype, i.e., plain, and \"plain\" as checkered. That would flip the terms. So, let me recast:\n\n- Checkered (plain): C absent, B absent \u2192 1\u00d71=1\n- Checkered brown: C absent, B present \u21921\u00d73=3\n- Plain brown: C present, B present \u21923\u00d71=3\n- Plain (checkered): C present, B absent \u21923\u00d73=9\n\nWait, but that still leads to the same ratio, but flipped. If \"checkered\" is considered as plain (C absent, B absent), then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:9, which isn't listed in the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses \"checkered\" to refer to the presence of both C and B alleles, making the dominant phenotype appear as \"checkered,\" but that contradicts the usual terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the options provided. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, implying 12 instances of one phenotype, 2 of another, etc. That could happen if all the F2 are either red or brown, but that doesn't align with our previous analysis.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross without considering the actual segregation patterns, treating it as a simple 9:3:3:1 ratio. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. That doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option K suggests 12 checkered red, which is too high. Option M is 4,4,4,4, which doesn't fit. Option N is 7,5,1,3, which is similar to 9:3:3:1 but slightly different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the initial setup. The F1 cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute CB or cb gametes. Thus, F1 is all CcBb. Then, the F2 would involve the selfing of CcBb, producing F2 genotypes.\n\nWait, but another thought: If the F1 is indeed CcBb, then when selfed, the expected F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the two traits. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes, which corresponds to:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, option L is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up because checkered brown and plain brown are both brown, whereas checkered red and plain checkered are red.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering \"checkered\" as the color, meaning brown, and \"plain\" as the other phenotype, meaning red. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered (brown):",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSince the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio combines these. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: both dominant (C and B)\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive (C_Bb)\n- Plain red: c dominant, B recessive (cc_b_)\n- Plain brown: both recessive (c c and b b)\n\nWait, no\u2014phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. So each gene contributes a phenotype:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: Red\n- cc_: Plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: Brown\n- bb_: Checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C_ and bb: C_bb \u2192 Red and Checkered \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. cc_ and B_: cc_B_ \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc_ and bb: cc_bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if each gene segregates independently. But wait, the options given don't match this exactly. Let me calculate the actual counts.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently. For the C locus: \n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since 3 out of 4 gametes carry C)\n- Probability of cc_: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B_: 3/4\n- Probability of bb_: 1/4\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these probabilities. So the possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. cc_B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdding up the first two cases: 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16 \u2192 3/4 chance of being either Checkered Red or Plain Brown. The remaining 4/16 split equally between Plain Red and Plain Checkered, giving 2/16 each.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Red: 12/16 = 3/4\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nA.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but the actual phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, but the actual phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotype is a combination of the two traits. To calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Presence of C (C_) : red (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence of C (cc) : plain\n\nFor the B locus: \n- Presence of B (B_) : brown\n- Absence of B (bb) : checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red brown\n2. C_ and bb: red checkered\n3. cc and B_: plain brown\n4. cc and bb: plain checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each combination is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene. Assuming independent assortment, the probabilities are:\n\n- C_ = \u00be (since \u00bc chance of cc)\n- bb = \u00bc (since \u00bc chance of cc)\nSimilarly, for B:\n- B_ = \u00be\n- bb = \u00bc\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1.

That doesn't match our calculation. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, none seem exactly matching my calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me double-check. Perhaps the genes are being considered together instead of independently. Alternatively, maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the outcome differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation consists of 9 possible genotypic combinations, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment). So the phenotypes would correspond to the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to look at the actual observed phenotypes based on the given options. Let me review the options:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 total 16, which seems too high.\nOption B: 8 CR, 4 RB, 0 PR, 4 PB \u2192 totals 16\nOption C: 9 CR, 3 RB, 3 PR, 1 PB \u2192 16\nOption D: 1 CR, 3 RB, 9 PR, 3 PB \u2192 16\nOption E: 3 CR, 9 RB, 1 PR, 3 PB \u2192 16\nOption F: 4 CR, 4 RB, 4 PR, 4 PB \u2192 16\nOption G: 12 CR, 2 RB, 2 PR, 0 PB \u2192 16\nOption H: 5 CR, 3 RB, 2 PR, 6 PB \u2192 16\nOption I: 7 CR, 5 RB, 1 PR, 3 PB \u2192 16\nOption J: 2 CR, 6 RB, 3 PR, 1 PB \u2192 12\n\nWait, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me re-examine. In the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype can be determined by counting the number of individuals without the recessive alleles. For example, checkered red (CR) would require both C and c alleles (wait, no: CR refers to the plain color, which is when both genes are recessive. Wait, no: CR could mean something else. Wait, hold on, perhaps I misinterpreted the notation.\n\nWait, CR might refer to the absence of pigment (plain red), RB to brown, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are different. Let me clarify the notation: The problem states:\n\nRed color (R) is governed by the dominant allele C.\n\nPlain color (p) is governed by the recessive allele c.\n\nBrown color (B) is governed by the dominant allele B.\n\nCheckered color (q) is governed by the recessive allele q.\n\nWait, but in the question, the first parent is CC BB, which would be red and brown. The second parent is cc bb, which would be plain and checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the letters. Let me write down the correct genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two alleles for color (B and b).\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 red; cc \u2192 plain\n- Color: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the cross of F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 would include all combinations of the six gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb, cb, cb?), but no\u2014it's simpler to use Punnett squares.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square properly. F1 is CcBb. Each parent contributes either C/B or c/b.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, each can only produce CB or cb gametes. Thus, the F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportion (25% each).\n\nThus, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, this isn't accurate because the F1 itself is CcBb, so the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes. So the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Wait, but considering independent assortment, each pair is equally likely. So the F2 will have four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB): C_ for both genes \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc (from CB + cb): C_ and B_ \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n3. cc (from cb + cb): c_ for both genes \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n4. bb (from cb + cb): c_ for both genes \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach is leading me to the same conclusion as before, which was approximately 9/16 Red Brown, 3/16 Red Checkered, 3/16 Plain Brown, and 1/16 Plain Checkered. None of the answer choices match this except possibly if there's a misunderstanding in the notation.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which matches the total population of 16 (since F2 has 16 possible offspring). Wait, no\u2014each gamete combines two alleles, but in reality, the F2 generation would have 25% each of the four phenotypes. However, the options don't reflect this directly. Instead, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio based on the number of each phenotype expressed in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual observed phenotypes based on the genetic makeup, not the counts. Let me try a different approach. Considering that each bird is a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the number of individuals without the recessive alleles for each trait.\n\nFor example, checkered red (cr) requires both c and b alleles (but wait, cr is probably a typo, perhaps CR stands for something else. Wait, the original question uses 'CR' and 'RB', which may be abbreviations for 'Checkered Red' and 'Red Brown'. Let me assume that CR stands for 'Checkered Red' and RB for 'Red Brown', and similarly, PR for 'Plain Red' and PB for 'Plain Brown'.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio can be found by determining how many individuals fall into each category:\n\n- CR (Checkered Red): Occurs when both alleles for pigment are recessive (cc) and both for color are recessive (bb). So genotype cc bb \u2192 Phenotype PR (Plain Red)\n- RB (Red Brown): Occurs when pigment is dominant (C_) and color is dominant (B_), regardless of the color (so B_ bb or B_ Bb)\n- PR (Plain Red): Occurs when pigment is recessive (cc) and color is dominant (B_)\n- PB (Plain Brown): Occurs when pigment is recessive (cc) and color is recessive (bb)\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal progeny: 16\n\n- CR (PR): Occurs when genotype is cc bb. Only 1 such genotype, contributing 1 bird.\n- RB: Any bird with C_ and B_. This includes all birds except those with cc or bb in color. So:\n  - C_ B_: 3 (C_ B_, C_ Bb, C B_)\n  - C_ bb: 2 (C Bb, C bb)\n  Total RB: 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the number of RB individuals is the sum of all individuals who have at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in color.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the Punnett square:\n\nFrom the F2 Punnett square:\n\n- All four phenotypes exist, but their counts depend on the combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (RR): Phenotype RR (Red Red)\n2. Cc (RR): Phenotype RR (Red Red)\n3. cc (PP): Phenotype PP (Plain Plain)\n4. bb (PP): Phenotype PP (Plain Plain)\n\nWait, this isn't right because the phenotypes depend on both traits. Let me make a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|----------|-----------|\n| CC       | RR        |\n| Cc       | RR        |\n| cc       | PP        |\n| bb       | PP        |\n\nBut this oversimplifies. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the correct way is to determine the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet me recount:\n\n- CR (Checkered Red): Occurs when genotype is cc bb \u2192 Phenotype PR (Plain Red)\n- RB (Red Brown): Occurs when genotype is Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype RB (Red Brown)\n- PR (Plain Red): Occurs when genotype is cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype PR (Plain Red)\n- PB (Plain Brown): Occurs when genotype is cc bb \u2192 Phenotype PB (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, but this still doesn't account for all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the principle that the number of each phenotype can be calculated by counting the number of individuals without the recessive alleles for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Number of CR (PR): Genotype cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Number of RB: All birds that have at least one dominant allele in pigment (C_) and at least one dominant allele in color (B_) \u2192 These include:\n  - C_ B_: C_ B_, C_ Bb, C Bb\n  - C_ bb: C Bb, C bb\n  Total RB: 5 birds\n- Number of PR: All birds that have at least one recessive allele in pigment (cc) and at least one dominant allele in color (B_) \u2192 These include:\n  - cc B_: cc B_, cc Bb\n  - cc bb: cc bb\n  Total PR: 4 birds\n- Number of PB: All birds that have recessive alleles in both traits (cc and bb) \u2192 1 bird\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 11. Wait, that's less than 16. Something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I realize now that some phenotypes overlap. For example, a bird that is CC bb would be RR (Red Red) and PR (Plain Red). Similarly, a bird with Cc bb is RR (Red Red) and PR (Plain Red). Therefore, these phenotypes cannot coexist, and the counts must exclude overlapping cases.\n\nThis complicates the matter, so perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider only the presence of dominant alleles without worrying about overlaps, which would lead to incorrect counts. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question asks for the number of each phenotype based on the F2 distribution, ignoring overlaps.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 16 birds total.\n- 9 would have both genes dominant (CR and RB), leading to RR and RB phenotypes.\n- 3 would have one dominant and one recessive for pigment but both dominant for color (RB).\n- 3 would have one recessive and one dominant for pigment but both recessive for color (PR).\n- 1 would have both recessive for both traits (PB).\n\nHowever, this is not entirely accurate because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously. Therefore, the correct counts would involve considering the combinations of both traits.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to note that in the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratio is approximately 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 checkered red (CR), 3 red brown (RB), 3 plain red (PR), and 1 plain brown (PB). Looking at the options, option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This does not align with the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, unless there's a misunderstanding in the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notation used in the question is different, such as CR representing a different phenotype. Without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would imply option D is correct if the numbers are swapped. But according to the options provided, option D has 9 checkered red, which contradicts the standard ratio. Therefore, I must reconsider.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct ratio for dihybrid crosses where both traits are independently controlled is indeed 9:3:3:1. In this case, each of the four phenotypes represents the following:\n\n- 9: Checkered Red (CR)\n- 3: Checkered Brown (RB)\n- 3: Plain Red (PR)\n- 1: Plain Brown (PB)\n\nIf the options are presented as the number of each phenotype, option D states:\n\ncheckered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWhich would correspond to 1 CR, 3 RB, 9 PR, and 3 PB. This suggests that the numbering is inverted, placing the higher numbers after the lower ones. Therefore, option D would be correct if the question expects the order to be reversed, but strictly speaking, the correct ratio should place 9 before 3, followed by 3, and ending with 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option D, despite the numbering order. Therefore, I'll choose option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nWait, but the actual phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotype is a combination of the two traits. To calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Presence of C (C_) : red (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence of C (cc) : plain\n\nFor the B locus: \n- Presence of B (B_) : brown\n- Absence of B (bb) : checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red brown\n2. C_ and bb: red checkered\n3. cc and B_: plain brown\n4. cc and bb: plain checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each combination is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene. Assuming independent assortment, the probabilities are:\n\n- C_ = \u00be (since \u00bc chance of cc)\n- bb = \u00bc (since \u00bc chance of cc)\nSimilarly, for B:\n- B_ = \u00be\n- bb = \u00bc\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: (\u00be)(\u00be) = 9/16\n2. C_ and bb: (\u00be)(\u00bc) = 3/16\n3. cc and B_: (\u00bc)(\u00be) = 3/16\n4. cc and bb: (\u00bc)(\u00bc) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are approximately:\n\n- Red Brown: 9 parts\n- Red Checkered: 3 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Checkered: 1 part\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, none seem exactly matching my calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me double-check. Perhaps the genes are being considered together instead of independently. Alternatively, maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the outcome differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation consists of 9 possible genotypic combinations, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment). So the phenotypes would correspond to the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to look at the actual observed phenotypes based on the given options. Let me review the options:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 total 16, which seems too high.\nOption B: 8 CR, 4 RB, 0 PR, 4 PB \u2192 totals 16\nOption C: 9 CR, 3 RB, 3 PR, 1 PB \u2192 16\nOption D: 1 CR, 3 RB, 9 PR, 3 PB \u2192 16\nOption E: 3 CR, 9 RB, 1 PR, 3 PB \u2192 16\nOption F: 4 CR, 4 RB, 4 PR, 4 PB \u2192 16\nOption G: 12 CR, 2 RB, 2 PR, 0 PB \u2192 16\nOption H: 5 CR, 3 RB, 2 PR, 6 PB \u2192 16\nOption I: 7 CR, 5 RB, 1 PR, 3 PB \u2192 16\nOption J: 2 CR, 6 RB, 3 PR, 1 PB \u2192 12\n\nWait, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me re-examine. In the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype can be determined by counting the number of individuals without the recessive alleles. For example, checkered red (CR) would require both C and c alleles (wait, no: CR refers to the plain color, which is when both genes are recessive. Wait, no: CR could mean something else. Wait, hold on, perhaps I misinterpreted the notation.\n\nWait, CR might refer to the absence of pigment (plain red), RB to brown, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are different. Let me clarify the notation: The problem states:\n\nRed color (R) is governed by the dominant allele C.\n\nPlain color (p) is governed by the recessive allele c.\n\nBrown color (B) is governed by the dominant allele B.\n\nCheckered color (q) is governed by the recessive allele q.\n\nWait, but in the question, the first parent is CC BB, which would be red and brown. The second parent is cc bb, which would be plain and checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the letters. Let me write down the correct genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two alleles for color (B and b).\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 red; cc \u2192 plain\n- Color: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the cross of F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 would include all combinations of the six gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb, cb, cb?), but no\u2014it's simpler to use Punnett squares.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square properly. F1 is CcBb. Each parent contributes either C/B or c/b.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, each can only produce CB or cb gametes. Thus, the F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportion (25% each).\n\nThus, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, this isn't accurate because the F1 itself is CcBb, so the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes. So the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Wait, but considering independent assortment, each pair is equally likely. So the F2 will have four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB): C_ for both genes \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc (from CB + cb): C_ and B_ \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n3. cc (from cb + cb): c_ for both genes \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n4. bb (from cb + cb): c_ for both genes \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach is leading me to the same conclusion as before, which was approximately 9/16 Red Brown, 3/16 Red Checkered, 3/16 Plain Brown, and 1/16 Plain Checkered. None of the answer choices match this except possibly if there's a misunderstanding in the notation.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which matches the total population of 16 (since F2 has 16 possible offspring). Wait, no\u2014each gamete combines two alleles, but in reality, the F2 generation would have 25% each of the four phenotypes. However, the options don't reflect this directly. Instead, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio based on the number of each phenotype expressed in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual observed phenotypes based on the genetic makeup, not the counts. Let me try a different approach. Considering that each bird is a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the number of individuals without the recessive alleles for each trait.\n\nFor example, checkered red (cr) requires both c and b alleles (but wait, cr is probably a typo, perhaps CR stands for something else. Wait, the original question uses 'CR' and 'RB', which may be abbreviations for 'Checkered Red' and 'Red Brown'. Let me assume that CR stands for 'Checkered Red' and RB for 'Red Brown', and similarly, PR for 'Plain Red' and PB for 'Plain Brown'.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio can be found by determining how many individuals fall into each category:\n\n- CR (Checkered Red): Occurs when both alleles for pigment are recessive (cc) and both for color are recessive (bb). So genotype cc bb \u2192 Phenotype PR (Plain Red)\n- RB (Red Brown): Occurs when pigment is dominant (C_) and color is dominant (B_), regardless of the color (so B_ bb or B_ Bb)\n- PR (Plain Red): Occurs when pigment is recessive (cc) and color is dominant (B_)\n- PB (Plain Brown): Occurs when pigment is recessive (cc) and color is recessive (bb)\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal progeny: 16\n\n- CR (PR): Occurs when genotype is cc bb. Only 1 such genotype, contributing 1 bird.\n- RB: Any bird with C_ and B_. This includes all birds except those with cc or bb in color. So:\n  - C_ B_: 3 (C_ B_, C_ Bb, C B_)\n  - C_ bb: 2 (C Bb, C bb)\n  Total RB: 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the number of RB individuals is the sum of all individuals who have at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in color.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the Punnett square:\n\nFrom the F2 Punnett square:\n\n- All four phenotypes exist, but their counts depend on the combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (RR): Phenotype RR (Red Red)\n2. Cc (RR): Phenotype RR (Red Red)\n3. cc (PP): Phenotype PP (Plain Plain)\n4. bb (PP): Phenotype PP (Plain Plain)\n\nWait, this isn't right because the phenotypes depend on both traits. Let me make a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|----------|-----------|\n| CC       | RR        |\n| Cc       | RR        |\n| cc       | PP        |\n| bb       | PP        |\n\nBut this oversimplifies. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the correct way is to determine the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet me recount:\n\n- CR (Checkered Red): Occurs when genotype is cc bb \u2192 Phenotype PR (Plain Red)\n- RB (Red Brown): Occurs when genotype is Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype RB (Red Brown)\n- PR (Plain Red): Occurs when genotype is cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype PR (Plain Red)\n- PB (Plain Brown): Occurs when genotype is cc bb \u2192 Phenotype PB (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, but this still doesn't account for all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the principle that the number of each phenotype can be calculated by counting the number of individuals without the recessive alleles for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Number of CR (PR): Genotype cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Number of RB: All birds that have at least one dominant allele in pigment (C_) and at least one dominant allele in color (B_) \u2192 These include:\n  - C_ B_: C_ B_, C_ Bb, C Bb\n  - C_ bb: C Bb, C bb\n  Total RB: 5 birds\n- Number of PR: All birds that have at least one recessive allele in pigment (cc) and at least one dominant allele in color (B_) \u2192 These include:\n  - cc B_: cc B_, cc Bb\n  - cc bb: cc bb\n  Total PR: 4 birds\n- Number of PB: All birds that have recessive alleles in both traits (cc and bb) \u2192 1 bird\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 11. Wait, that's less than 16. Something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I realize now that some phenotypes overlap. For example, a bird that is CC bb would be RR (Red Red) and PR (Plain Red). Similarly, a bird with Cc bb is RR (Red Red) and PR (Plain Red). Therefore, these phenotypes cannot coexist, and the counts must exclude overlapping cases.\n\nThis complicates the matter, so perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider only the presence of dominant alleles without worrying about overlaps, which would lead to incorrect counts. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question asks for the number of each phenotype based on the F2 distribution, ignoring overlaps.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 16 birds total.\n- 9 would have both genes dominant (CR and RB), leading to RR and RB phenotypes.\n- 3 would have one dominant and one recessive for pigment but both dominant for color (RB).\n- 3 would have one recessive and one dominant for pigment but both recessive for color (PR).\n- 1 would have both recessive for both traits (PB).\n\nHowever, this is not entirely accurate because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously. Therefore, the correct counts would involve considering the combinations of both traits.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to note that in the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratio is approximately 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 checkered red (CR), 3 red brown (RB), 3 plain red (PR), and 1 plain brown (PB). Looking at the options, option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This does not align with the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, unless there's a misunderstanding in the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notation used in the question is different, such as CR representing a different phenotype. Without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would imply option D is correct if the numbers are swapped. But according to the options provided, option D has 9 checkered red, which contradicts the standard ratio. Therefore, I must reconsider.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct ratio for dihybrid crosses where both traits are independently controlled is indeed 9:3:3:1. In this case, each of the four phenotypes represents the following:\n\n- 9: Checkered Red (CR)\n- 3: Checkered Brown (RB)\n- 3: Plain Red (PR)\n- 1: Plain Brown (PB)\n\nIf the options are presented as the number of each phenotype, option D states:\n\ncheckered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWhich would correspond to 1 CR, 3 RB, 9 PR, and 3 PB. This suggests that the numbering is inverted, placing the higher numbers after the lower ones. Therefore, option D would be correct if the question expects the order to be reversed, but strictly speaking, the correct ratio should place 9 before 3, followed by 3, and ending with 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option D, despite the numbering order. Therefore, I'll choose option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

But in this case, both genes are fully expressed, so the phenotypes are determined by either the pigment being present or absent, and similarly for color.\n\nTherefore, each bird can exhibit one of four phenotypes:\n1. Checkered and brown (both genes recessive)\n2. Checkered and plain (only B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (only C recessive)\n4. Plain and checkered (both genes recessive)\n\nBut wait, checkered and plain could also mean something else, but according to the description:\n- Checkered is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Plain is determined by recessive allele c.\nSo, a bird can be:\n- Checkered: both c (so cc)\n- Plain: both c (but wait, that's impossible because if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then F2 would have various combinations)\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes (since both are dominant).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb, and can only produce CB and cb gametes.

Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the question says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and \"a plain brown bird\" (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from selfing F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the principles. Let me approach it differently. Using a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 where F1 is CcBb:\n\nThe Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\n- From the top row: Cc (C and c)\n- From the left column: Bb (B and b)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider each gene separately. So for the C locus:\n\nParent 1: Cc \u2192 gametes: C (50%) and c (50%)\n\nParent 2: Cc \u2192 same as above.\n\nCrossing Cc x Cc:\n\nPossible C combinations: C+C=CC (100%), C+c=Cc (50%), c+c=cc (50%).

Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, the correct way is to look at each bird's genotype and assign the phenotype based on dominant alleles.\n\nFor example:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- Cc bb: C recessive, B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc BB: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSo now, counting how many fall into each category:\n\nRed-Brown: 2 (from CC BB and CC bb)\nWait, no: looking back at the numbers:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 6\n- CC Bb: 12\n- CC bb: 6\n- Cc BB: 12\n- Cc Bb: 25\n- Cc bb: 12\n- cc BB: 6\n- cc Bb: 12\n- cc bb: 6\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown: CC BB (6) and CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 12\n- Red-Checkered: CC Bb (12) and CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 18\n- Plain-Brown: Cc BB (12) and Cc Bb (25) and Cc bb (12) \u2192 Total 49\n- Plain-Checkered: cc BB (6), cc Bb (12), cc bb (6) \u2192 Total 24\n\nWait, that adds up to 12+18+49+24=103, which is off by one due to rounding. But let's proceed.\n\nNow, the options given are A through H, with varying ratios. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThat totals 16, which is less than 100, so probably not. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 12, which is close but not exact. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16, still too low.\n\nWait, none of the options add up to exactly 100. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents was incorrect.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both genes. Wait, the question says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is correct as per our previous calculation. So the number of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red-Brown: 12\n- Red-Checkered: 18\n- Plain-Brown: 49\n- Plain-Checkered: 24\n\nLooking at the options, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 16, which is way lower. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 16. Option A has 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16. Option B has 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16. Option C has 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16. Option D has 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16. Option F has 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. Option I has 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16. Option H has 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16.\n\nHmm, none of the options sum to 100. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio for F2, so perhaps it's expecting the count without considering dominance beyond what's shown. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me double-check the definitions:\n\n- Checkered: recessive allele c (from both parents)\n- Plain: recessive allele c (from both parents)\n- Red: dominant allele C\n- Brown: dominant allele B\n\nSo, the phenotype for a bird is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. At least one C or B, but not both dominant \u2192 Depending on which is missing, it's either Red-Checkered, Checkered-Brown, or Checkered-Checkered\n3. Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nIn our case, the F2 genotypes after crossing CcBb x CcBb include:\n\n- CC BB: Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Brown\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, let's count each phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: CC BB (6), CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 12\n- Red-Checkered: CC Bb (12), CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 18\n- Plain-Brown: Cc BB (12), Cc Bb (25), Cc bb (12) \u2192 Total 49\n- Plain-Checkered: cc BB (6), cc Bb (12), cc bb (6) \u2192 Total 24\n\nAdding them up: 12+18=30, 30+49=79, 79+24=103. Hmm, discrepancy because we rounded the numbers during the Punnett square. But regardless, the key point is the distribution of phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none of them sum to 100 except perhaps option E: 3,9,1,3 sums to 16, which is not matching. Option A: 6,2,6,2 is 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 is 16. Option B: 8,4,0,4 is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual counts before rounding are different. Let me recalculate the counts without rounding:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- CC Bb: 50% \u2192 50\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 25\n- Cc BB: 50% \u2192 50\n- Cc Bb: 25% \u2192 25\n- Cc bb: 50% \u2192 50\n- cc BB: 25% \u219225\n- cc Bb:50%\u219250\n- cc bb:25%\u219225\n\nNow, precise counts:\n\n- CC BB: 25 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb:50 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- CC bb:25 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB:50 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb:25 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc bb:50 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc BB:25 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb:50 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb:25 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n- Red-Brown: 25 +25=50\n- Red-Checkered:50 +25=75\n- Plain-Brown:50 +25 +25=100?\nWait, no: Cc BB is Plain-Brown (50), Cc Bb is Plain-Brown (25), and cc BB is Plain-Brown (25). So total Plain-Brown: 50+25+25=100\n- Plain-Checkered: cc Bb (50) + cc bb (25)=75\n\nWait, that can't be right because 50 (Red-Brown) +75 (Red-Checkered)+100 (Plain-Brown)+75 (Plain-Checkered) =300, which exceeds 100. Clearly, I messed up the assignment of counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the actual counts without rounding would be:\n\n- CC BB:25\n- CC Bb:50\n- CC bb:25\n- Cc BB:50\n- Cc Bb:25\n- Cc bb:50\n- cc BB:25\n- cc Bb:50\n- cc bb:25\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes precisely:\n\n- CC BB: Red-Brown (25)\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered (50)\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered (25)\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown (50)\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Brown (25)\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered (50)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (25)\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered (50)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (25)\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Red-Brown:25 +25=50\n- Red-Checkered:50 +25=75\n- Plain-Brown:50 +25 +25=100\n- Plain-Checkered:50 +50 +25=125\n\nAgain, over 100. This suggests that perhaps the initial approach is flawed, and instead, we should rely on the principle of inheritance rather than enumerating all possible cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the rule of thumb for dihybrid crosses. In a dihybrid cross (two independent genes), the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, in this case, both genes are fully dominant, so the phenotypes would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, but in reality, since each gene is dominant for their respective colors and pigmentation, the phenotypic ratio would be similar to a monohybrid cross but applied to both genes. However, since both genes are independent, the combined ratios would involve multiplication.\n\nBut perhaps the question is intended to treat each gene separately, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, in this case, both genes are expressing, so the phenotypes would combine as such.\n\nWait, let's consider each gene:\n\n- For pigment color (C): RR (dominant) = red, rr = plain\n- For coat color (B): BB (dominant) = brown, bb = checkered\n\nAssuming these genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio for each gene alone would",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming independent assortment, the probability of each phenotype combination is the product of the individual probabilities. Let me calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence (C): 100%\n- Absence (c): 0%\n\nSo, no need to worry about recessive for pigment.\n\nFor color (B):\n- Presence (B): 100%\n- Absence (b): 0%\n\nSimilarly, no need to worry about recessive for color.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because if both genes were recessive for some traits, the ratios might change. But in this case, both genes are fully expressed, so the phenotypes are determined by either the pigment being present or absent, and similarly for color.\n\nTherefore, each bird can exhibit one of four phenotypes:\n1. Checkered and brown (both genes recessive)\n2. Checkered and plain (only B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (only C recessive)\n4. Plain and checkered (both genes recessive)\n\nBut wait, checkered and plain could also mean something else, but according to the description:\n- Checkered is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Plain is determined by recessive allele c.\nSo, a bird can be:\n- Checkered: both c (so cc)\n- Plain: both c (but wait, that's impossible because if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then F2 would have various combinations)\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes (since both are dominant).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb, and can only produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes based on dominance:\n- Pigment (C): dominant (C) \u2192 red, recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- Color (B): dominant (B) \u2192 brown, recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypes combine as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLet's list the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C present, C present) \u2192 Pigment: red, Color: brown \u2192 Phenotype: Red-Brown\n2. Cc (C present, c present) \u2192 Pigment: red, Color: brown \u2192 Phenotype: Red-Brown\n3. cc (c present, c present) \u2192 Pigment: plain, Color: checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain-Checkered\n4. bb (b present, b present) \u2192 Pigment: plain, Color: checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, among the four F2 genotypes, two will be Red-Brown and two will be Plain-Checkered.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match any of the options given. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the question says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and \"a plain brown bird\" (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from selfing F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the principles. Let me approach it differently. Using a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 where F1 is CcBb:\n\nThe Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\n- From the top row: Cc (C and c)\n- From the left column: Bb (B and b)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider each gene separately. So for the C locus:\n\nParent 1: Cc \u2192 gametes: C (50%) and c (50%)\n\nParent 2: Cc \u2192 same as above.\n\nCrossing Cc x Cc:\n\nPossible C combinations: C+C=CC (100%), C+c=Cc (50%), c+c=cc (50%). Similarly for B locus:\n\nParent 1: Bb \u2192 gametes: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 same.\n\nCrossing Bb x Bb:\n\nPossible B combinations: BB (100%), Bb (50%), bb (50%).\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, for the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining them:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, converting these percentages into counts:\n\n- 6.25% CC BB \u2192 approximately 6 individuals\n- 12.5% CC Bb \u2192 approx 12\n- 6.25% CC bb \u2192 6\n- 12.5% Cc BB \u2192 12\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 25\n- 12.5% Cc bb \u2192 12\n- 6.25% cc BB \u2192 6\n- 12.5% cc Bb \u2192 12\n- 6.25% cc bb \u2192 6\n\nTotal: 6+12+6+12+25+12+6+12+6 = 100\n\nNow, determining phenotypes based on dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Both C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant (red), B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant (red), B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- Cc bb: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because some phenotypes overlap. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, the correct way is to look at each bird's genotype and assign the phenotype based on dominant alleles.\n\nFor example:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- Cc bb: C recessive, B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc BB: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSo now, counting how many fall into each category:\n\nRed-Brown: 2 (from CC BB and CC bb)\nWait, no: looking back at the numbers:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 6\n- CC Bb: 12\n- CC bb: 6\n- Cc BB: 12\n- Cc Bb: 25\n- Cc bb: 12\n- cc BB: 6\n- cc Bb: 12\n- cc bb: 6\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown: CC BB (6) and CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 12\n- Red-Checkered: CC Bb (12) and CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 18\n- Plain-Brown: Cc BB (12) and Cc Bb (25) and Cc bb (12) \u2192 Total 49\n- Plain-Checkered: cc BB (6), cc Bb (12), cc bb (6) \u2192 Total 24\n\nWait, that adds up to 12+18+49+24=103, which is off by one due to rounding. But let's proceed.\n\nNow, the options given are A through H, with varying ratios. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThat totals 16, which is less than 100, so probably not. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 12, which is close but not exact. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16, still too low.\n\nWait, none of the options add up to exactly 100. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents was incorrect.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both genes. Wait, the question says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is correct as per our previous calculation. So the number of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red-Brown: 12\n- Red-Checkered: 18\n- Plain-Brown: 49\n- Plain-Checkered: 24\n\nLooking at the options, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 16, which is way lower. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 16. Option A has 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16. Option B has 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16. Option C has 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16. Option D has 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16. Option F has 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. Option I has 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16. Option H has 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16.\n\nHmm, none of the options sum to 100. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio for F2, so perhaps it's expecting the count without considering dominance beyond what's shown. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me double-check the definitions:\n\n- Checkered: recessive allele c (from both parents)\n- Plain: recessive allele c (from both parents)\n- Red: dominant allele C\n- Brown: dominant allele B\n\nSo, the phenotype for a bird is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. At least one C or B, but not both dominant \u2192 Depending on which is missing, it's either Red-Checkered, Checkered-Brown, or Checkered-Checkered\n3. Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nIn our case, the F2 genotypes after crossing CcBb x CcBb include:\n\n- CC BB: Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Brown\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, let's count each phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: CC BB (6), CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 12\n- Red-Checkered: CC Bb (12), CC bb (6) \u2192 Total 18\n- Plain-Brown: Cc BB (12), Cc Bb (25), Cc bb (12) \u2192 Total 49\n- Plain-Checkered: cc BB (6), cc Bb (12), cc bb (6) \u2192 Total 24\n\nAdding them up: 12+18=30, 30+49=79, 79+24=103. Hmm, discrepancy because we rounded the numbers during the Punnett square. But regardless, the key point is the distribution of phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none of them sum to 100 except perhaps option E: 3,9,1,3 sums to 16, which is not matching. Option A: 6,2,6,2 is 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 is 16. Option B: 8,4,0,4 is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual counts before rounding are different. Let me recalculate the counts without rounding:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- CC Bb: 50% \u2192 50\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 25\n- Cc BB: 50% \u2192 50\n- Cc Bb: 25% \u2192 25\n- Cc bb: 50% \u2192 50\n- cc BB: 25% \u219225\n- cc Bb:50%\u219250\n- cc bb:25%\u219225\n\nNow, precise counts:\n\n- CC BB: 25 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb:50 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- CC bb:25 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB:50 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc Bb:25 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- Cc bb:50 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc BB:25 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb:50 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb:25 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n- Red-Brown: 25 +25=50\n- Red-Checkered:50 +25=75\n- Plain-Brown:50 +25 +25=100?\nWait, no: Cc BB is Plain-Brown (50), Cc Bb is Plain-Brown (25), and cc BB is Plain-Brown (25). So total Plain-Brown: 50+25+25=100\n- Plain-Checkered: cc Bb (50) + cc bb (25)=75\n\nWait, that can't be right because 50 (Red-Brown) +75 (Red-Checkered)+100 (Plain-Brown)+75 (Plain-Checkered) =300, which exceeds 100. Clearly, I messed up the assignment of counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the actual counts without rounding would be:\n\n- CC BB:25\n- CC Bb:50\n- CC bb:25\n- Cc BB:50\n- Cc Bb:25\n- Cc bb:50\n- cc BB:25\n- cc Bb:50\n- cc bb:25\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes precisely:\n\n- CC BB: Red-Brown (25)\n- CC Bb: Red-Checkered (50)\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered (25)\n- Cc BB: Plain-Brown (50)\n- Cc Bb: Plain-Brown (25)\n- Cc bb: Plain-Checkered (50)\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown (25)\n- cc Bb: Plain-Checkered (50)\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered (25)\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Red-Brown:25 +25=50\n- Red-Checkered:50 +25=75\n- Plain-Brown:50 +25 +25=100\n- Plain-Checkered:50 +50 +25=125\n\nAgain, over 100. This suggests that perhaps the initial approach is flawed, and instead, we should rely on the principle of inheritance rather than enumerating all possible cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the rule of thumb for dihybrid crosses. In a dihybrid cross (two independent genes), the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, in this case, both genes are fully dominant, so the phenotypes would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, but in reality, since each gene is dominant for their respective colors and pigmentation, the phenotypic ratio would be similar to a monohybrid cross but applied to both genes. However, since both genes are independent, the combined ratios would involve multiplication.\n\nBut perhaps the question is intended to treat each gene separately, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, in this case, both genes are expressing, so the phenotypes would combine as such.\n\nWait, let's consider each gene:\n\n- For pigment color (C): RR (dominant) = red, rr = plain\n- For coat color (B): BB (dominant) = brown, bb = checkered\n\nAssuming these genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio for each gene alone would",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

Assuming independent assortment, the combined phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, where the order is for the combination of C/B dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, the order might matter if one gene affects another. However, without knowing linkage, we'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nNow, applying this to our case:\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for each gene, there are two possibilities, making four phenotypes overall: \n1. Checkered red (both C and B absent)\n2. Checkered brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain red (C and B present)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of alleles. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nParental genotypes: F1 is CcBb, F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.

    "chunk_resampled": "Each gene has a 3:1 ratio if we consider dominance, but since it's dihybrid, it's a 9:3:3:1 ratio.",
    "rollout": " Each gene has a 3:1 ratio if we consider dominance, but since it's dihybrid, it's a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, our case doesn't involve any blending; instead, it's simple dominance. So for each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- Presence: 2/3 (since c is recessive)\n- Absence: 1/3\n\nFor B:\n- Presence: 2/3 (since b is recessive)\n- Absence: 1/3\n\nSince both genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios are (for each gene) multiplied together. So 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 for both genes being present (red and brown), 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 for C present and B absent, 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 for C absent and B present, and 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 for both absent (checkered and brown). Wait, but that seems off. Alternatively, the actual number of phenotypic classes would be 3 for pigment (C) times 3 for color (B), giving 9 classes. However, some might combine into fewer phenotypes if the same phenotype results from different combinations.\n\nWait, but the question mentions specific phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. That suggests that all four combinations are distinct, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options given, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that sums up to 5+3+2+6=16, which is less than 18 (the sum of 9+3+3+1). Maybe the user made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is wrong. Let me re-examine the parent relationships.\n\nThe parent pairs are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 dominant C and dominant B \u2192 must produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 recessive c and recessive b \u2192 must produce cb gametes.\n\nThus, F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each).\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a probability of 25%. Now, determining the phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant, so the phenotypic ratios are based on:\n\nRed (C present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9\n\nRed and Checkered (B present, C absent) \u2192 (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\n\nPlain (C present, B absent) \u2192 (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\n\nCheckered (C present, B present) \u2192 (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nBut wait, the user's answer choices don't align with this straightforward approach. Instead, let's look at the options provided:\n\nLooking at the options, option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing these: 5+3+2+6=16, which is less than 18. Perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, perhaps the parent relationships were considered incorrectly. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would indeed be CcBb, but perhaps the way the gametes are formed was misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dihybrid cross isn't simply squaring the F1, but rather considering all possible combinations. However, the user has already constructed a detailed Punnett square for F1 gametes, but perhaps they're asking for the F2 generation. In that case, the F2 would be the squares generated by F1 \u00d7 F1, but the user hasn't provided the F2 squares yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratios after considering the dihybrid cross without focusing on the F1. Let me try another approach: using the Punnett square method for the F2 generation. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb. When F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nPhenotype classes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 plain red\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the expected counts in F2:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals = 16 (since 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nProportions:\n\n1. Checkered red: (number of CB gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n2. Plain red: (number of Cb gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n3. Checkered brown: (number of cb gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n4. Plain brown: (number of cc gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n\nWait, but this gives 1/16 for each phenotype, totaling 4 units, but the total number of F2 individuals should be 16. So scaling up by 16, each phenotype would occur once. However, the options provided don't match this directly. Looking back, none of the options seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum 16. Hmm, adding up to 16, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (16). So option H seems to fit. Let me verify why.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: 1/16 \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: 2/16 \u2192 plain red\n- cc: 1/16 \u2192 checkered brown\n- bb: 2/16 \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up correctly. Let me recalculate. The number of each phenotype depends on how many of the F2 genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (only one genotype) \u2192 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain red: Cc (two genotypes, each 1/16) \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: cc (one genotype) \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: bb (two genotypes) \u2192 2\n\nThis adds up to 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which contradicts the earlier thought process. Wait, no, this is incorrect. The correct way is:\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific genotype combination. Specifically:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): only CC \u2192 1/16\n- Plain red (C_bb): only Cc \u2192 2/16 (since there are two Cc genotypes, each contributing 1/16)\n- Checkered brown (cc_B_): only cc \u2192 1/16\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): only cc (wait, no\u2014it's bb, which includes both b and b alleles. So the number of plain brown is the number of bb genotypes, which is 1/16.\n\nBut according to the standard dihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where 9 are checkered red, 3 are plain red, 3 are checkered brown, and 1 is plain brown. However, in this case, the phenotypic categories are defined differently, grouping the recessive traits into separate categories. So perhaps the actual numbers are different.\n\nLet me count the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (only CC)\n- Plain red: 2 (Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (cc)\n- Plain brown: 2 (bb)\n\nAdding up to 6, but this doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because in reality, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on how we group the recessives, the numbers could change. However, in this case, the question groups the recessive traits separately, so the F2 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (both recessive present): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain red (only one recessive present): 2/16 \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown (only one dominant present): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain brown (none present): 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nWhich totals to 6, but this contradicts the 9:3:3:1 ratio. This suggests that my understanding is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that in this specific setup, the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Both recessive (checkered and brown): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Checkered (only recessive brown): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain (only recessive red): 2/16 \u2192 2\n- Both dominant (red and brown): 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:2:2. However, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 total 16. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16, which fits the 16 total F2 individuals. But what does this correspond to?\n\nIf we assume that:\n\n- Checkered red: 5\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nThis would imply that in F2, the majority are plain red and plain brown, with fewer checkered ones. But according to the standard dihybrid cross, the checkered trait should be more common. However, in this case, the phenotypic grouping separates the recessive traits into different categories, making the checkered trait appear less frequent. \n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 5\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nWhich sums to 16. This corresponds to option H. Therefore, the correct answer is H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Each gene has a 3:1 ratio if we consider dominance, but since it's dihybrid, it's a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, our case doesn't involve any blending; instead, it's simple dominance. So for each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- Presence: 2/3 (since c is recessive)\n- Absence: 1/3\n\nFor B:\n- Presence: 2/3 (since b is recessive)\n- Absence: 1/3\n\nSince both genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios are (for each gene) multiplied together. So 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 for both genes being present (red and brown), 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 for C present and B absent, 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 for C absent and B present, and 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 for both absent (checkered and brown). Wait, but that seems off. Alternatively, the actual number of phenotypic classes would be 3 for pigment (C) times 3 for color (B), giving 9 classes. However, some might combine into fewer phenotypes if the same phenotype results from different combinations.\n\nWait, but the question mentions specific phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. That suggests that all four combinations are distinct, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options given, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that sums up to 5+3+2+6=16, which is less than 18 (the sum of 9+3+3+1). Maybe the user made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is wrong. Let me re-examine the parent relationships.\n\nThe parent pairs are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 dominant C and dominant B \u2192 must produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 recessive c and recessive b \u2192 must produce cb gametes.\n\nThus, F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each).\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a probability of 25%. Now, determining the phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant, so the phenotypic ratios are based on:\n\nRed (C present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9\n\nRed and Checkered (B present, C absent) \u2192 (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\n\nPlain (C present, B absent) \u2192 (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\n\nCheckered (C present, B present) \u2192 (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nBut wait, the user's answer choices don't align with this straightforward approach. Instead, let's look at the options provided:\n\nLooking at the options, option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing these: 5+3+2+6=16, which is less than 18. Perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, perhaps the parent relationships were considered incorrectly. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would indeed be CcBb, but perhaps the way the gametes are formed was misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dihybrid cross isn't simply squaring the F1, but rather considering all possible combinations. However, the user has already constructed a detailed Punnett square for F1 gametes, but perhaps they're asking for the F2 generation. In that case, the F2 would be the squares generated by F1 \u00d7 F1, but the user hasn't provided the F2 squares yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratios after considering the dihybrid cross without focusing on the F1. Let me try another approach: using the Punnett square method for the F2 generation. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb. When F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nPhenotype classes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 plain red\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the expected counts in F2:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals = 16 (since 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nProportions:\n\n1. Checkered red: (number of CB gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n2. Plain red: (number of Cb gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n3. Checkered brown: (number of cb gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n4. Plain brown: (number of cc gametes)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1 unit\n\nWait, but this gives 1/16 for each phenotype, totaling 4 units, but the total number of F2 individuals should be 16. So scaling up by 16, each phenotype would occur once. However, the options provided don't match this directly. Looking back, none of the options seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum 16. Hmm, adding up to 16, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (16). So option H seems to fit. Let me verify why.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: 1/16 \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: 2/16 \u2192 plain red\n- cc: 1/16 \u2192 checkered brown\n- bb: 2/16 \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up correctly. Let me recalculate. The number of each phenotype depends on how many of the F2 genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (only one genotype) \u2192 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain red: Cc (two genotypes, each 1/16) \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: cc (one genotype) \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: bb (two genotypes) \u2192 2\n\nThis adds up to 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which contradicts the earlier thought process. Wait, no, this is incorrect. The correct way is:\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific genotype combination. Specifically:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): only CC \u2192 1/16\n- Plain red (C_bb): only Cc \u2192 2/16 (since there are two Cc genotypes, each contributing 1/16)\n- Checkered brown (cc_B_): only cc \u2192 1/16\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): only cc (wait, no\u2014it's bb, which includes both b and b alleles. So the number of plain brown is the number of bb genotypes, which is 1/16.\n\nBut according to the standard dihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where 9 are checkered red, 3 are plain red, 3 are checkered brown, and 1 is plain brown. However, in this case, the phenotypic categories are defined differently, grouping the recessive traits into separate categories. So perhaps the actual numbers are different.\n\nLet me count the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (only CC)\n- Plain red: 2 (Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (cc)\n- Plain brown: 2 (bb)\n\nAdding up to 6, but this doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because in reality, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on how we group the recessives, the numbers could change. However, in this case, the question groups the recessive traits separately, so the F2 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (both recessive present): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain red (only one recessive present): 2/16 \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown (only one dominant present): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain brown (none present): 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nWhich totals to 6, but this contradicts the 9:3:3:1 ratio. This suggests that my understanding is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that in this specific setup, the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Both recessive (checkered and brown): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Checkered (only recessive brown): 1/16 \u2192 1\n- Plain (only recessive red): 2/16 \u2192 2\n- Both dominant (red and brown): 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:2:2. However, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 total 16. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16, which fits the 16 total F2 individuals. But what does this correspond to?\n\nIf we assume that:\n\n- Checkered red: 5\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nThis would imply that in F2, the majority are plain red and plain brown, with fewer checkered ones. But according to the standard dihybrid cross, the checkered trait should be more common. However, in this case, the phenotypic grouping separates the recessive traits into different categories, making the checkered trait appear less frequent. \n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 5\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nWhich sums to 16. This corresponds to option H. Therefore, the correct answer is H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "rollout": " \n\nWait, but the question mentions that the birds have specific phenotypes: checkered (cB?), but the description says \"red\", \"plain\", \"brown\", and \"checkered\". So each bird can display one of four phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_B_): red, brown \u2192 checkered red?\nWait, no. Wait, the description says:\n\n- Checkered = cB\n- Plain = cc\n- Brown = BB\n- Red = CB\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's genotype determines their phenotype:\n\n- Genotype: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Genotype: CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown (B is recessive, so brown)\n- Genotype: cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red (c is recessive, so plain, and B dominant so red)\n- Genotype: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown (both recessive)\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have the following genotypic ratios based on Mendelian inheritance. Since both parents are heterozygous (CcBb), the F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each of these corresponds to phenotypes. Now, let's map the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (cB) | CC | 25%\nCheckered brown (Bb?) Wait, no. Wait, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n\n- C_: dominant, red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor B (color):\n\n- B_: dominant, brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_) and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant (C_) and B is recessive (bb), then the bird is Checkered brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is Plain red.\n- If C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb), then the bird is Plain brown.\n\nThus, the probability for each phenotype is 25% for each, except that some genotypes may overlap. Wait, but in reality, each bird's genotype is unique, so each phenotype has 25% probability. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered (cB) \u2192 c (recessive for pigment) and B (dominant for color) \u2192 plain red\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 recessive for pigment and recessive for color \u2192 plain brown\n- Brown (BB) \u2192 dominant for pigment and recessive for color \u2192 checkered brown\n- Red (CB) \u2192 dominant for both \u2192 checkered red\n\nWait, but according to the standard dominance hierarchy, if an animal is homozygous recessive for pigment, it is plain regardless of color, and vice versa. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- cB: plain red\n- cc: plain brown\n- BB: checkered brown\n- CB: checkered red\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Checkered red was cB, but now I'm getting confused. Let me confirm:\n\nThe question states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Brown color is controlled by dominant gene B\n- Brown is determined by dominant allele B\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if B is dominant, then brown would always be expressed, unless... Wait, the wording might be ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) is determined by C (dominant)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) is determined by B (dominant)\n\nWhich suggests that:\n\n- For pigment: C_ \u2192 Red, cc \u2192 Checkered\n- For color: B_ \u2192 Brown, bb \u2192 Plain\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red?)\nWait, no. Wait, the color is determined by B, and the pigment by C. So:\n\nIf C is dominant (C_), then the bird is red or checkered depending on B.\n\nSimilarly, if B is dominant (B_), then the bird is brown or plain depending on C.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) depends on C (C_ \u2192 Red, cc \u2192 Checkered)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) depends on B (B_ \u2192 Brown, bb \u2192 Plain)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n2. C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc and B_ \u2192 Plain brown\n4. cc and bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nGiven that, each bird's genotype determines which phenotype it shows. Now, the F2 generation will have a certain distribution among these four phenotypes.\n\nSince the parents are both CcBb, the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be generated by crossing F1 with itself. However, the user provided a detailed set of gametes, but perhaps they aren't necessary for calculating the F2 phenotypic ratio. Instead, we can use the standard Mendelian probabilities.\n\nIn F2 generation, each trait is independently assorting, so the probabilities multiply. For each gene:\n\n- For pigment (C): 25% C_, 25% cc\n- For color (B): 25% B_, 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for each possible combination of phenotypes.\n\nHowever, each bird can only express one phenotype. So the actual probabilities are:\n\n- C_ and B_: (25% for C_) * (25% for B_) = 6.25%\n- C_ and bb: (25%) * (25% for bb) = 6.25%\n- cc and B_: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc and bb: 6.25%\n\nAdding them up gives 25%, matching the 1/4 chance for each phenotype. But since each bird can only exhibit one phenotype, each of the four phenotypes accounts for 25% of the population. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly state this. Instead, the options suggest different ratios. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenotypes are determined differently. Let me consider another approach: the four possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nEach bird's genotype leads to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- C_ and bb \u2192 Plain red (phenotype 2)\n- cc and B_ \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype 3)\n- cc and bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- For Checkered red (C_ and B_):\n  - Probability of C_ is 25% (for Cc) and B_ is 25% (for Bb). Since C and B are independent, it's 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For Plain red (C_ and bb):\n  - C_ is 25%, bb is 25%. So 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For Checkered brown (cc and B_):\n  - cc is 25%, B_ is 25%. So 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For Plain brown (cc and bb):\n  - cc is 25%, bb is 25%. So 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nTotal adds up to 25%, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\" which sums to 18, not 25. Option A is 6,2,6,2 summing to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6 which also sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3 summing to 16. None of these add up to 25%. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the number of possible gametes each parent can produce, leading to a total of 16 possible F2 individuals. Each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBB\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with what I thought before. Alternatively, each parent contributes two alleles, leading to four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so there are two gametes per parent, making four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to think that each parent can produce either CB or cb, so when crossed, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB (wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then each contributes one allele. Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the Punnett square construction.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes\n\nSo F1: CcBb, as both parents contribute CB and cb respectively.\n\nThen F2 is formed by F1 (CcBb) selfing. So the F2 genotype possibilities are:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes are CB and cb, each with 50% chance.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB (probability 25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (probability 25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb (probability 25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb (probability 25%)\n\nWait, but according to the user's initial setup, the gametes listed were CB, cb, cB, cb, cb, cb, etc.\u2014so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 genotypes include all combinations where the parents' gametes combine, including recombinants, but in this case, since there's no crossover (assuming no linkage), all gametes are independent.\n\nHowever, without considering linkage, all gametes are parental-type, so no recombinations occur. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to phenotypes?\n\nLet me map the phenotypes based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 C_ (pigment dominant) and B_ (color dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CcBb \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. ccbb \u2192 cc (no pigment) and bb (no color) \u2192 Plain brown\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right. Because in F2, the phenotypes should follow the expected ratios based on the dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Let me try again:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) \u2192 determined by C (C_ \u2192 Red, cc \u2192 Checkered)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) \u2192 determined by B (B_ \u2192 Brown, bb \u2192 Plain)\n\nSo:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n- C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc and B_ \u2192 Brown (Checkered brown)\n- cc and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that contradicts the previous reasoning. Maybe the correct mapping is:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n- C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc and B_ \u2192 Brown (Checkered brown)\n- cc and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that still results in each phenotype having 25% probability, leading to a sum of 25% for each. However, none of the answer choices reflect this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAnother possibility is that the dominance is such that:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) is determined by B (B_ \u2192 Red, bb \u2192 Checkered)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) is determined by C (C_ \u2192 Brown, cc \u2192 Checkered)\n\nThat changes things. So:\n\n- B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n- C_ \u2192 Brown\n- cc \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s inconsistent. Let me rephrase:\n\nIf B is dominant for pigment, then:\n\n- B_ \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nAnd C is dominant for color:\n\n- C_ \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by both traits:\n\n- If both B and C are dominant \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 Brown (Checkered brown)\n- If B dominant, C recessive \u2192 Brown and Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If B recessive, C dominant \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered red\n- If both recessive \u2192 Checkered and Checkered \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't align. Let me create a table:\n\nPhenotype | C | B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | ? | ?\nPlain red | ? | ?\nCheckered brown | ? | ?\nPlain brown | ? | ?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for a different approach. Perhaps I should calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nIn F2:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. ccBB \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n4. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n5. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n6. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n7. c c B b \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n8. c c B b \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Actually, after selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014parents are CcBb, so they can produce gametes CB and cb each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, that's only four phenotypes. But that doesn't account for the other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all possible gamete combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me recall that in a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation has 16 possible genotypic combinations, each with a probability of 1/16. Each combination can lead to a specific phenotype based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nSo:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBB \u2192 cc and B_ \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccBb \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CcBb \u2192 same as above\n- ccBb \u2192 same as above\n- c c B b \u2192 same as above\n- c c B b \u2192 same as above\n\nWait, but that's 8 phenotypes, each appearing twice. That doesn't make sense because each phenotype should appear multiple times. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that each gamete combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet me instead consider the possible phenotypic ratios based on the number of each genotype:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 25%\n2. CcBb \u2192 50%\n3. ccBB \u2192 25%\n4. ccBb \u2192 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n- CcBb \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown (50%)\n- ccBB \u2192 cc and B_ \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n- ccBb \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n\nWait, but that's still 25%, 50%, 25%, 25% for the four phenotypes, adding up to 100%. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exact distribution.\n\nLooking at the answer choices again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2\nB.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nWait, but the question mentions that the birds have specific phenotypes: checkered (cB?), but the description says \"red\", \"plain\", \"brown\", and \"checkered\". So each bird can display one of four phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_B_): red, brown \u2192 checkered red?\nWait, no. Wait, the description says:\n\n- Checkered = cB\n- Plain = cc\n- Brown = BB\n- Red = CB\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's genotype determines their phenotype:\n\n- Genotype: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Genotype: CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown (B is recessive, so brown)\n- Genotype: cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red (c is recessive, so plain, and B dominant so red)\n- Genotype: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown (both recessive)\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have the following genotypic ratios based on Mendelian inheritance. Since both parents are heterozygous (CcBb), the F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each of these corresponds to phenotypes. Now, let's map the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (cB) | CC | 25%\nCheckered brown (Bb?) Wait, no. Wait, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n\n- C_: dominant, red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor B (color):\n\n- B_: dominant, brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_) and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant (C_) and B is recessive (bb), then the bird is Checkered brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is Plain red.\n- If C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb), then the bird is Plain brown.\n\nThus, the probability for each phenotype is 25% for each, except that some genotypes may overlap. Wait, but in reality, each bird's genotype is unique, so each phenotype has 25% probability. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered (cB) \u2192 c (recessive for pigment) and B (dominant for color) \u2192 plain red\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 recessive for pigment and recessive for color \u2192 plain brown\n- Brown (BB) \u2192 dominant for pigment and recessive for color \u2192 checkered brown\n- Red (CB) \u2192 dominant for both \u2192 checkered red\n\nWait, but according to the standard dominance hierarchy, if an animal is homozygous recessive for pigment, it is plain regardless of color, and vice versa. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- cB: plain red\n- cc: plain brown\n- BB: checkered brown\n- CB: checkered red\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Checkered red was cB, but now I'm getting confused. Let me confirm:\n\nThe question states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Brown color is controlled by dominant gene B\n- Brown is determined by dominant allele B\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if B is dominant, then brown would always be expressed, unless... Wait, the wording might be ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) is determined by C (dominant)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) is determined by B (dominant)\n\nWhich suggests that:\n\n- For pigment: C_ \u2192 Red, cc \u2192 Checkered\n- For color: B_ \u2192 Brown, bb \u2192 Plain\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red?)\nWait, no. Wait, the color is determined by B, and the pigment by C. So:\n\nIf C is dominant (C_), then the bird is red or checkered depending on B.\n\nSimilarly, if B is dominant (B_), then the bird is brown or plain depending on C.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) depends on C (C_ \u2192 Red, cc \u2192 Checkered)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) depends on B (B_ \u2192 Brown, bb \u2192 Plain)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n2. C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc and B_ \u2192 Plain brown\n4. cc and bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nGiven that, each bird's genotype determines which phenotype it shows. Now, the F2 generation will have a certain distribution among these four phenotypes.\n\nSince the parents are both CcBb, the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be generated by crossing F1 with itself. However, the user provided a detailed set of gametes, but perhaps they aren't necessary for calculating the F2 phenotypic ratio. Instead, we can use the standard Mendelian probabilities.\n\nIn F2 generation, each trait is independently assorting, so the probabilities multiply. For each gene:\n\n- For pigment (C): 25% C_, 25% cc\n- For color (B): 25% B_, 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for each possible combination of phenotypes.\n\nHowever, each bird can only express one phenotype. So the actual probabilities are:\n\n- C_ and B_: (25% for C_) * (25% for B_) = 6.25%\n- C_ and bb: (25%) * (25% for bb) = 6.25%\n- cc and B_: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc and bb: 6.25%\n\nAdding them up gives 25%, matching the 1/4 chance for each phenotype. But since each bird can only exhibit one phenotype, each of the four phenotypes accounts for 25% of the population. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly state this. Instead, the options suggest different ratios. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenotypes are determined differently. Let me consider another approach: the four possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nEach bird's genotype leads to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- C_ and bb \u2192 Plain red (phenotype 2)\n- cc and B_ \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype 3)\n- cc and bb \u2192 Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- For Checkered red (C_ and B_):\n  - Probability of C_ is 25% (for Cc) and B_ is 25% (for Bb). Since C and B are independent, it's 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For Plain red (C_ and bb):\n  - C_ is 25%, bb is 25%. So 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For Checkered brown (cc and B_):\n  - cc is 25%, B_ is 25%. So 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For Plain brown (cc and bb):\n  - cc is 25%, bb is 25%. So 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nTotal adds up to 25%, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\" which sums to 18, not 25. Option A is 6,2,6,2 summing to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6 which also sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3 summing to 16. None of these add up to 25%. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the number of possible gametes each parent can produce, leading to a total of 16 possible F2 individuals. Each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBB\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with what I thought before. Alternatively, each parent contributes two alleles, leading to four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so there are two gametes per parent, making four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to think that each parent can produce either CB or cb, so when crossed, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB (wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then each contributes one allele. Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the Punnett square construction.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes\n\nSo F1: CcBb, as both parents contribute CB and cb respectively.\n\nThen F2 is formed by F1 (CcBb) selfing. So the F2 genotype possibilities are:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes are CB and cb, each with 50% chance.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB (probability 25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (probability 25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb (probability 25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb (probability 25%)\n\nWait, but according to the user's initial setup, the gametes listed were CB, cb, cB, cb, cb, cb, etc.\u2014so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 genotypes include all combinations where the parents' gametes combine, including recombinants, but in this case, since there's no crossover (assuming no linkage), all gametes are independent.\n\nHowever, without considering linkage, all gametes are parental-type, so no recombinations occur. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to phenotypes?\n\nLet me map the phenotypes based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 C_ (pigment dominant) and B_ (color dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CcBb \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. ccbb \u2192 cc (no pigment) and bb (no color) \u2192 Plain brown\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right. Because in F2, the phenotypes should follow the expected ratios based on the dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Let me try again:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) \u2192 determined by C (C_ \u2192 Red, cc \u2192 Checkered)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) \u2192 determined by B (B_ \u2192 Brown, bb \u2192 Plain)\n\nSo:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n- C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc and B_ \u2192 Brown (Checkered brown)\n- cc and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that contradicts the previous reasoning. Maybe the correct mapping is:\n\n- C_ and B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n- C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc and B_ \u2192 Brown (Checkered brown)\n- cc and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that still results in each phenotype having 25% probability, leading to a sum of 25% for each. However, none of the answer choices reflect this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAnother possibility is that the dominance is such that:\n\n- Pigmented (Red/Checkered) is determined by B (B_ \u2192 Red, bb \u2192 Checkered)\n- Color (Brown/Plain) is determined by C (C_ \u2192 Brown, cc \u2192 Checkered)\n\nThat changes things. So:\n\n- B_ \u2192 Red (Checkered red)\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n- C_ \u2192 Brown\n- cc \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s inconsistent. Let me rephrase:\n\nIf B is dominant for pigment, then:\n\n- B_ \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nAnd C is dominant for color:\n\n- C_ \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by both traits:\n\n- If both B and C are dominant \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 Brown (Checkered brown)\n- If B dominant, C recessive \u2192 Brown and Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If B recessive, C dominant \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered red\n- If both recessive \u2192 Checkered and Checkered \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't align. Let me create a table:\n\nPhenotype | C | B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | ? | ?\nPlain red | ? | ?\nCheckered brown | ? | ?\nPlain brown | ? | ?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for a different approach. Perhaps I should calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nIn F2:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. ccBB \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n4. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n5. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n6. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n7. c c B b \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n8. c c B b \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Actually, after selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014parents are CcBb, so they can produce gametes CB and cb each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, that's only four phenotypes. But that doesn't account for the other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all possible gamete combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me recall that in a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation has 16 possible genotypic combinations, each with a probability of 1/16. Each combination can lead to a specific phenotype based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nSo:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBB \u2192 cc and B_ \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccBb \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CcBb \u2192 same as above\n- ccBb \u2192 same as above\n- c c B b \u2192 same as above\n- c c B b \u2192 same as above\n\nWait, but that's 8 phenotypes, each appearing twice. That doesn't make sense because each phenotype should appear multiple times. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that each gamete combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet me instead consider the possible phenotypic ratios based on the number of each genotype:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 25%\n2. CcBb \u2192 50%\n3. ccBB \u2192 25%\n4. ccBb \u2192 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n- CcBb \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered brown (50%)\n- ccBB \u2192 cc and B_ \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n- ccBb \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n\nWait, but that's still 25%, 50%, 25%, 25% for the four phenotypes, adding up to 100%. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exact distribution.\n\nLooking at the answer choices again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2\nB.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "But actually, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits.",
    "rollout": " \n\nBut actually, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits. So for each trait, there are three possibilities, leading to nine possible combinations. However, in reality, some combinations may not occur due to dominance relationships.\n\nWait, but in the given options, the choices don't include nine categories. Instead, looking back, the options A through H list different ratios. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, but focusing on the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to analyze each trait separately and then combine them. For the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red): 2/3 (since c is recessive)\n- Absence of C (plain): 1/3\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (brown): 2/3\n- Absence of B (checkered): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are calculated by considering all combinations of the presence or absence of C and B.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered brown\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered plain\n3. C absent, B present: Plain brown\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain checkered\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each:\n\n1. Both present: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n2. C present, B absent: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n3. C absent, B present: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n4. Both absent: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are approximately 4:2:2:1, where 4 corresponds to checkered brown, 2 to checkered plain, 2 to plain brown, and 1 to plain checkered. Wait, but none of the options directly reflect this. Looking back at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match our calculation. Option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems off too. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles rather than the recessive ones being represented differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the user is considering the presence of dominant alleles as red and brown, while the recessive ones are plain and checkered. So in terms of phenotype counts, if each bird is either red, brown, plain, or checkered, depending on whether any dominant alleles are present.\n\nIn that case, for each bird:\n\n- If both C and B are present (i.e., C is dominant and B is dominant), the bird is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent, it's Checkered Plain.\n- If C is absent and B is present, it's Plain Brown.\n- If both C and B are absent, it's Plain Checkered.\n\nThe probabilities remain the same as before: 4:2:2:1. But the answer options don't align with this. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the recessive forms as separate phenotypes, but in reality, the recessive forms are already accounted for in the 1 part. So, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive forms and count only the dominant ones, which would be 4 parts for checkered (brown and plain) and 1 part for plain checkered. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum=16, but our total should be 9.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum=12.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum=16.\n\nHmm. None seem to add up to 9. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the number of birds in each phenotype category without considering dominance beyond the basic rules.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's actual numbers, not the phenotypic ratios. Let me see what the options say. For example, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Option J sums to 12, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation's total population, expecting a certain distribution among the four phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is making a mistake in listing the options, and the correct answer isn't listed. But likely, the intended correct option is missing. However, according to my earlier analysis, the correct ratio would be 4:2:2:1, but none of the options reflect that. Therefore, perhaps the correct choice is option G, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to provide a different scenario. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to choose the closest option, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the correct option isn't provided. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, often the intended answer is option D or E. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of dominant alleles leads to those phenotypes, regardless of dominance order.

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to ask about the F1 generation, but in the prompt, the F2 is being asked.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio would be (number of C outcomes) * (number of B outcomes). Wait, let me calculate:\n\nFor C locus:\n- Presence (C): 2/3 (since 1/3 is plain)\nWait, no, if each parent contributes C or c equally, then the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for the C locus. Similarly, for the B locus: 3:1.\n\nBut when combining both genes, the phenotypic ratios multiply. So for each gene, the number of phenotypes is 3. So overall, there are 3 x 3 = 9 phenotypic categories. However, some categories might overlap depending on dominance.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1.

Calculating each:\n\n- Red Brown: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- Red Checkered: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Brown: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Red: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nTo get the actual numbers, let's assume a large population, say 9 individuals. Then:\n\n- 4 red brown\n- 2 red checkered\n- 2 plain brown\n- 1 plain red\n\nBut wait, the user's options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the choices provided.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because there are 9 possible outcomes, so 0 plain brown isn't right.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also, 5+3=8, 2+6=8, totaling 16, which exceeds the 9 possible.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Sum to 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum to 16.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum to 16.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 12.\n\nHmm, none of them add up to 9. This suggests I might have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype order is based on whether the alleles are dominant or not. Pigmentation is determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). Pigment is brown if B is present (dominant), else checkered. Pigment is red if C is present (dominant), else plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype order from most to least dominant is:\n\nCheckered Brown (Bb) > Checkered Red (cc) > Plain Brown (BB) > Plain Red (bb)\n\nNow, let's recompute the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/3 absent.\n\nFor the F2 generation, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- BB and Bb: These are brown. Their proportion is (2/3)*(2/3) + (2/3)*(1/3) = 4/9 + 2/9 = 6/9\n- bb and Bb: These are checkered. Proportion: (1/3)*(2/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 + 1/9 = 3/9\n- CC and BB: These are plain red. Proportion: (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(2/3) = 1/9 + 2/9 = 3/9\n- cc and BB: These are plain brown. Proportion: (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(2/3) = 1/9 + 2/9 = 3/9\n\nWait, that can't be right because adding all together: 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15, but there should be 9. I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute each phenotype's count based on the possible genotypic combinations:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered Brown (Bb) | C_Bb, c_Bb | ?\n- For C: 2/3\n- For B: 1/3\n- Combined: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\nSimilarly, Checkered Red (cc) comes from Cc and cc:\n- Cc: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n- cc: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\nTotal for Checkered Brown: 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9\nCheckered Red: 2/9 + 1/9 = 3/9\nPlain Brown (BB) and Plain Red (cc):\n\n- BB: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n- cc: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\nTotal for Plain Brown: 4/9 + 1/9 = 5/9\nPlain Red: 1/9 + 1/9 = 2/9\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me try a different approach. Using Punnett squares:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so gametes are CB)\nParent 2: cc bb (gametes are cb)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. But since the F1 is selfed, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)\n- bb: Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n\nSo, looking at counts:\n\nEach of the four genotypes appears once in the F2, so four phenotypes. But the user provides nine possible outcomes earlier, which suggests that the user may have considered both parents contributing two alleles each. Let me see the original options again.\n\nWait, the user presented the options as follows:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nSo, according to our analysis, the correct ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 4/9 of the time\n- Checkered Red: 3/9\n- Plain Brown: 5/9\n- Plain Red: 1/9\n\nWait, but none of the options match this exact distribution. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 16, which doesn't fit 9. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, sum to 16. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 12. None seem to match 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me redo it:\n\nEach gene is independent, so:\n\nProbability of Checkered Brown (Bb): (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\nProbability of Checkered Red (cc): (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\nProbability of Plain Brown (BB): (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\nProbability of Plain Red (bb): (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 2/9 + 1/9 + 4/9 + 1/9 = 8/9. Hmm, missing 1/9. What's wrong?\n\nAh! Because the phenotypes are ordered, and the probabilities should account for dominance. Wait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- For each phenotype, count how many genotypic combinations lead to it.\n\nCheckered Brown (Bb):\n\n- From C_Bb and c_Bb: (2/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9\n- Plus bb and Bb: 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: Plain Brown\n4. CC bb: Same as 3\n5. Cc BB: Checkered Brown\n6. Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n7. Cc bb: Plain Brown\n8. Cc bb: Same as 7\n9. cc BB: Plain Red\n10. cc Bb: Checkered Red\n11. cc bb: Plain Red\n12. cc bb: Same as 11\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me structure it differently. Each parent contributes two alleles, so F2 will have four alleles per bird.\n\nEach bird's genotype is determined by the alleles from each parent. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- All combinations where C and B are present in any combination.\n- And similarly for other combinations.\n\nBut given the dominance hierarchy, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C or B will be either Checkered Brown or Checkered Red or Plain Brown or Plain Red.\nWait, no. The presence of dominant alleles leads to specific colors. Let me use a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| CC BB     | Checkered Red |\n| CC Bb     | Checkered Brown |\n| CC bb     | Plain Brown |\n| Cc BB     | Checkered Brown |\n| Cc Bb     | Checkered Brown |\n| Cc bb     | Plain Brown |\n| cc BB     | Plain Red      |\n| cc Bb     | Checkered Red |\n| cc bb     | Plain Red      |\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cc BB, CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 3 instances\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain Red: cc BB, cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, but this sums to 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9, which matches the 9 possible genotypic combinations. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 3/9\n- Checkered Red: 2/9\n- Plain Brown: 2/9\n- Plain Red: 2/9\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum to 16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum to 16.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 12.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum to 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Sum to 16.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match what I've calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the phenotypes based on the table:\n\nFrom the table, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Checkered Red: 2\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Red: 2\n\nWhich totals to 9. So the correct ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No, too high.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2013 No.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2013 No.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2013 No.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2013 No, since total is 16.\n\nWait, I'm still not finding a match. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement: Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents. The problem states: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing.\n\nIn F2, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each of the four phenotypes, but considering dominance, it might change. Wait, no, because the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (probability C present AND B present) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- Checkered Red: (C present AND B absent) + (C absent AND B absent) = (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3) = 2/9 + 1/9 = 3/9\n- Plain Brown: (C absent AND B present) = (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Red: (C present AND B absent) = (2/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nWait, that adds up to 4/9 + 3/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 10/9, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, the correct way is to realize that each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present, so:\n\n- Checkered Brown (both B and C present): (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- Checkered Red (C present, B absent): (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Brown (C absent, B present): (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Red (both C and B absent): (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThis accounts for 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, so",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio would be (number of C outcomes) * (number of B outcomes). Wait, let me calculate:\n\nFor C locus:\n- Presence (C): 2/3 (since 1/3 is plain)\nWait, no, if each parent contributes C or c equally, then the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for the C locus. Similarly, for the B locus: 3:1.\n\nBut when combining both genes, the phenotypic ratios multiply. So for each gene, the number of phenotypes is 3. So overall, there are 3 x 3 = 9 phenotypic categories. However, some categories might overlap depending on dominance.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both dominant alleles for C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n4.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to consider each gene separately and combine the results. Let's structure it properly:\n\nFor the C locus (gene C):\n- Presence (C): 2/3 (red)\n- Absence (c): 1/3 (plain)\n\nFor the B locus (gene B):\n- Presence (B): 2/3 (brown)\n- Absence (b): 1/3 (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is (2/3) * (2/3) for red brown, plus (2/3)*(1/3) for red checkered, plus (1/3)*(2/3) for plain brown, plus (1/3)^2 for plain red. Calculating each:\n\n- Red Brown: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- Red Checkered: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Brown: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Red: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nTo get the actual numbers, let's assume a large population, say 9 individuals.

This suggests I might have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype order is based on whether the alleles are dominant or not. Pigmentation is determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). Pigment is brown if B is present (dominant), else checkered. Pigment is red if C is present (dominant), else plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype order from most to least dominant is:\n\nCheckered Brown (Bb) > Checkered Red (cc) > Plain Brown (BB) > Plain Red (bb)\n\nNow, let's recompute the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/3 absent.\n\nFor the F2 generation, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- BB and Bb: These are brown. Their proportion is (2/3)*(2/3) + (2/3)*(1/3) = 4/9 + 2/9 = 6/9\n- bb and Bb: These are checkered. Proportion: (1/3)*(2/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 + 1/9 = 3/9\n- CC and BB: These are plain red. Proportion: (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(2/3) = 1/9 + 2/9 = 3/9\n- cc and BB: These are plain brown. Proportion: (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(2/3) = 1/9 + 2/9 = 3/9\n\nWait, that can't be right because adding all together: 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15, but there should be 9. I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute each phenotype's count based on the possible genotypic combinations:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered Brown (Bb) | C_Bb, c_Bb | ?\n- For C: 2/3\n- For B: 1/3\n- Combined: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\nSimilarly, Checkered Red (cc) comes from Cc and cc:\n- Cc: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n- cc: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\nTotal for Checkered Brown: 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9\nCheckered Red: 2/9 + 1/9 = 3/9\nPlain Brown (BB) and Plain Red (cc):\n\n- BB: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n- cc: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\nTotal for Plain Brown: 4/9 + 1/9 = 5/9\nPlain Red: 1/9 + 1/9 = 2/9\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me try a different approach. Using Punnett squares:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so gametes are CB)\nParent 2: cc bb (gametes are cb)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. But since the F1 is selfed, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain Red (c dominant, B recessive)\n- bb: Plain Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n\nSo, looking at counts:\n\nEach of the four genotypes appears once in the F2, so four phenotypes. But the user provides nine possible outcomes earlier, which suggests that the user may have considered both parents contributing two alleles each. Let me see the original options again.\n\nWait, the user presented the options as follows:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nSo, according to our analysis, the correct ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 4/9 of the time\n- Checkered Red: 3/9\n- Plain Brown: 5/9\n- Plain Red: 1/9\n\nWait, but none of the options match this exact distribution. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 16, which doesn't fit 9. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, sum to 16. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 12. None seem to match 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me redo it:\n\nEach gene is independent, so:\n\nProbability of Checkered Brown (Bb): (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\nProbability of Checkered Red (cc): (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\nProbability of Plain Brown (BB): (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\nProbability of Plain Red (bb): (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 2/9 + 1/9 + 4/9 + 1/9 = 8/9. Hmm, missing 1/9. What's wrong?\n\nAh! Because the phenotypes are ordered, and the probabilities should account for dominance. Wait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- For each phenotype, count how many genotypic combinations lead to it.\n\nCheckered Brown (Bb):\n\n- From C_Bb and c_Bb: (2/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9\n- Plus bb and Bb: 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: Plain Brown\n4. CC bb: Same as 3\n5. Cc BB: Checkered Brown\n6. Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n7. Cc bb: Plain Brown\n8. Cc bb: Same as 7\n9. cc BB: Plain Red\n10. cc Bb: Checkered Red\n11. cc bb: Plain Red\n12. cc bb: Same as 11\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me structure it differently. Each parent contributes two alleles, so F2 will have four alleles per bird.\n\nEach bird's genotype is determined by the alleles from each parent. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- All combinations where C and B are present in any combination.\n- And similarly for other combinations.\n\nBut given the dominance hierarchy, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C or B will be either Checkered Brown or Checkered Red or Plain Brown or Plain Red.\nWait, no. The presence of dominant alleles leads to specific colors. Let me use a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| CC BB     | Checkered Red |\n| CC Bb     | Checkered Brown |\n| CC bb     | Plain Brown |\n| Cc BB     | Checkered Brown |\n| Cc Bb     | Checkered Brown |\n| Cc bb     | Plain Brown |\n| cc BB     | Plain Red      |\n| cc Bb     | Checkered Red |\n| cc bb     | Plain Red      |\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cc BB, CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 3 instances\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain Red: cc BB, cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, but this sums to 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9, which matches the 9 possible genotypic combinations. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 3/9\n- Checkered Red: 2/9\n- Plain Brown: 2/9\n- Plain Red: 2/9\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum to 16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum to 16.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 12.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum to 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Sum to 16.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match what I've calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the phenotypes based on the table:\n\nFrom the table, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Checkered Red: 2\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Red: 2\n\nWhich totals to 9. So the correct ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No, too high.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2013 No.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2013 No.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2013 No.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2013 No, since total is 16.\n\nWait, I'm still not finding a match. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement: Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents. The problem states: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing.\n\nIn F2, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each of the four phenotypes, but considering dominance, it might change. Wait, no, because the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (probability C present AND B present) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- Checkered Red: (C present AND B absent) + (C absent AND B absent) = (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3) = 2/9 + 1/9 = 3/9\n- Plain Brown: (C absent AND B present) = (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Red: (C present AND B absent) = (2/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nWait, that adds up to 4/9 + 3/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 10/9, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, the correct way is to realize that each gene has a 2/3 chance of being present, so:\n\n- Checkered Brown (both B and C present): (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- Checkered Red (C present, B absent): (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Brown (C absent, B present): (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Red (both C and B absent): (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThis accounts for 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, so",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has two options, leading to four phenotypes per gene.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has two options, leading to four phenotypes per gene. But since both genes are considered together, the total phenotypic combinations are 2 x 2 = 4: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of both dominant alleles leads to the highest phenotype, followed by either dominant and recessive, then the other way around. So the order is: red-brown > red-checkered > plain-brown > plain-checkered.\n\nNow, for the F2 population, each gene has a 3/4 chance of being dominant and 1/4 recessive. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for having both dominant traits, (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 for one dominant and one recessive, etc. But wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe possible combinations for each gene are:\n\n- C: presence (red) \u2192 3/4\n- C: absence \u2192 1/4\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- B: presence (brown) \u2192 3/4\n- B: absence \u2192 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities combine by multiplication. So the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nBut wait, the user mentions showing the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't add up because 6+2+6+2=16, which makes sense as 4^2=16. However, according to our calculation, the probabilities would be 9/16 for red-brown, 3/16 for red-checkered, 3/16 for plain-brown, and 1/16 for plain-checkered. Multiplying each by 16 gives us 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So the phenotypic ratio would be red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option A is different. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the letters were misaligned. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Using the actual F2 genotypes. The F2 would include the following possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc bb): This happens when both genes are recessive. From the F1 (CcBb), the gametes are CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each 50%. So the F2 would have 25% CC (which is checkered red), 25% Cc (which is checkered brown?), 25% cc (which is plain red), and 25% bb (plain brown). Wait, no, because the F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%): checkered red\n- Cc (probability 50%): checkered brown\n- cc (probability 25%): plain red\n- bb (probability 25%): plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (cc bb): 25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc bb): 25%\n- Plain red (cc BB): 25%\n- Plain brown (Cc BB): 25%\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the dominance of alleles. Actually, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive, regardless of which gene they are. So, for example, if an animal has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it would display the most dominant phenotype.\n\nBut in terms of counting phenotypes, each of these genotypes corresponds to specific phenotypes based on dominance. So, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThus, in the F2, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: aa bb (but in F2, this would be cc bb)\n2. Checkered brown: Aa bb (Cc bb)\n3. Plain red: aa BB (cc BB)\n4. Plain brown: Aa BB (Cc BB)\n\nEach of these has a certain frequency. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So for each gene, the frequency of dominant trait is higher than recessive.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Presence (dominant) \u2192 red (3/4)\n- Absence \u2192 plain (1/4)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Presence (dominant) \u2192 brown (3/4)\n- Absence \u2192 checkered (1/4)\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both dominant \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red (wait, but in reality, if both are present, it's red, but in the context of the other genes, perhaps it's more accurate to say that if both dominant, it's red-brown, but the user might be referring to the phenotype hierarchy.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the count based on the number of each phenotype. So, for F2:\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). The probability is (1/4)(1/4)=1/16, so 1 unit.\n- Checkered brown: Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive (Cc and bb). Probability is (3/4)(1/4)=3/16, so 3 units.\n- Plain red: Occurs when C is recessive and B is dominant (cc and Bb). Probability is (1/4)(3/4)=3/16, so 3 units.\n- Plain brown: Occurs when both C and B are dominant (Cc and BB). Probability is (3/4)(3/4)=9/16, so 9 units.\n\nAdding them up: 1+3+3+9=16, which matches the denominator. So the phenotypic distribution is Checkered red:1, Checkered brown:3, Plain red:3, Plain brown:9. Looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 9. That doesn't match. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches exactly what I found. So the answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two options, leading to four phenotypes per gene. But since both genes are considered together, the total phenotypic combinations are 2 x 2 = 4: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of both dominant alleles leads to the highest phenotype, followed by either dominant and recessive, then the other way around. So the order is: red-brown > red-checkered > plain-brown > plain-checkered.\n\nNow, for the F2 population, each gene has a 3/4 chance of being dominant and 1/4 recessive. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for having both dominant traits, (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 for one dominant and one recessive, etc. But wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe possible combinations for each gene are:\n\n- C: presence (red) \u2192 3/4\n- C: absence \u2192 1/4\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- B: presence (brown) \u2192 3/4\n- B: absence \u2192 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities combine by multiplication. So the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nBut wait, the user mentions showing the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't add up because 6+2+6+2=16, which makes sense as 4^2=16. However, according to our calculation, the probabilities would be 9/16 for red-brown, 3/16 for red-checkered, 3/16 for plain-brown, and 1/16 for plain-checkered. Multiplying each by 16 gives us 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So the phenotypic ratio would be red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option A is different. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the letters were misaligned. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Using the actual F2 genotypes. The F2 would include the following possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc bb): This happens when both genes are recessive. From the F1 (CcBb), the gametes are CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each 50%. So the F2 would have 25% CC (which is checkered red), 25% Cc (which is checkered brown?), 25% cc (which is plain red), and 25% bb (plain brown). Wait, no, because the F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%): checkered red\n- Cc (probability 50%): checkered brown\n- cc (probability 25%): plain red\n- bb (probability 25%): plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (cc bb): 25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc bb): 25%\n- Plain red (cc BB): 25%\n- Plain brown (Cc BB): 25%\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the dominance of alleles. Actually, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive, regardless of which gene they are. So, for example, if an animal has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it would display the most dominant phenotype.\n\nBut in terms of counting phenotypes, each of these genotypes corresponds to specific phenotypes based on dominance. So, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThus, in the F2, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: aa bb (but in F2, this would be cc bb)\n2. Checkered brown: Aa bb (Cc bb)\n3. Plain red: aa BB (cc BB)\n4. Plain brown: Aa BB (Cc BB)\n\nEach of these has a certain frequency. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So for each gene, the frequency of dominant trait is higher than recessive.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Presence (dominant) \u2192 red (3/4)\n- Absence \u2192 plain (1/4)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Presence (dominant) \u2192 brown (3/4)\n- Absence \u2192 checkered (1/4)\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both dominant \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red (wait, but in reality, if both are present, it's red, but in the context of the other genes, perhaps it's more accurate to say that if both dominant, it's red-brown, but the user might be referring to the phenotype hierarchy.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the count based on the number of each phenotype. So, for F2:\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). The probability is (1/4)(1/4)=1/16, so 1 unit.\n- Checkered brown: Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive (Cc and bb). Probability is (3/4)(1/4)=3/16, so 3 units.\n- Plain red: Occurs when C is recessive and B is dominant (cc and Bb). Probability is (1/4)(3/4)=3/16, so 3 units.\n- Plain brown: Occurs when both C and B are dominant (Cc and BB). Probability is (3/4)(3/4)=9/16, so 9 units.\n\nAdding them up: 1+3+3+9=16, which matches the denominator. So the phenotypic distribution is Checkered red:1, Checkered brown:3, Plain red:3, Plain brown:9. Looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 9. That doesn't match. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches exactly what I found. So the answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each gene has a 3:1 ratio in terms of phenotypic expression if considering dominance.",
    "rollout": " \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio in terms of phenotypic expression if considering dominance. However, since each gene's effect is independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines both. But in reality, when both genes are considered together, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the possible genotypes and then mapping them to phenotypes. Each bird is determined by two genes, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible genotypes for each trait, but when considering both traits, it's more complex. Alternatively, using a Punnett square for two loci, each with two alleles, considering dominance.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb (each 50%).\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the dominant alleles are present. Let's list each genotype and map to phenotype:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C: red\n- c: plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B: brown\n- b: checkered\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented)\n   - Both C's are dominant, so pigment is red.\n   - Checkered? No, since both are C, so color is brown? Wait, hold on. Wait, the presence of 'B' determines color. So, even though the bird is red (because C is dominant), it's also brown (because B is dominant). So the phenotype is brown checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented)\n   - C is dominant, so red pigment.\n   - c is recessive, so plain color.\n   - Since C is present, the bird is red checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented)\n   - Both c's are recessive, so plain pigment.\n   - Since B is recessive, the bird is plain brown.\n\n4. bb (Plain Pigmented)\n   - Both b's are recessive, so plain pigment.\n   - Since B is recessive, the bird is plain brown.\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. For example, a bird could be Cc (red checkered) and bb (plain brown). Similarly, a bird could be CC (red pigmented) and bb (plain brown).\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype occur in F2:\n\nAssuming a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio when considering two dominant traits, but in this case, it's more complex because each trait is influenced by different alleles. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 population, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since bb is homozygous recessive)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBecause each parent contributes either C or c, and the probabilities combine accordingly. Now, for each genotype, what phenotype do they express?\n\nPhenotype determination is done by checking for dominant alleles:\n\n- For C: any C results in red pigment, regardless of B.\n- For B: any B results in brown color, regardless of c.\n\nSo, let's apply this to each genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C is dominant, so red pigment.\n   - B is not present (since it's CC), so plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain (checkered? Wait, no. Wait, if it's CC, then B isn't expressed because it's recessive. Wait, no: Wait, in the bird, the B is part of the genotype, but the phenotype depends on whether B is present or not. Wait, no, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for the bird to exhibit a particular phenotype, it must have at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing this. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. Each bird has two copies of each gene, and the phenotype reflects the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - If at least one C is present, the bird is red.\n  - Otherwise, it's plain.\n\n- Color (B):\n  - If at least one B is present, the bird is brown.\n  - Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, a bird can be characterized by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C is present \u2192 red pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented):\n   - C is present \u2192 red pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, Cc means at least one C (so red pigment), and at least one c (so plain color). But for the color gene, if B is present, it's brown; else, plain. So for Cc, the presence of C makes it red, and the presence of c makes it plain. So the phenotype is brown plain.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented):\n   - c is present \u2192 plain pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\n4. bb (Plain Pigmented):\n   - b is present \u2192 plain pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if you have bb, then both genes are recessive, resulting in plain color and plain pigment. But wait, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, another way: To get a particular phenotype, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nPhenotype: Brown Plain.\n\nTo have this, the bird must have at least one B (for brown) and at least one c (for plain). Wait, no: Let's think differently. The presence of B makes it brown, regardless of c. The presence of c makes it plain, regardless of B. So, a bird that is Cc (has at least one C) and Bb (has at least one B) would be brown checkered.\n\nWait, no, let's take each bird:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented, Plain Color):\n   - Has C \u2192 red.\n   - No B \u2192 plain.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n- Cc (Red Pigmented, Plain Color):\n   - Has C \u2192 red.\n   - No B \u2192 plain.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if it's Cc, it has at least one C, making it red, and at least one c, making it plain. So both traits are expressed. Thus, both traits would be brown and plain, respectively.\n\nWait, but according to the initial problem statement, the color is determined by B, and the checkering by c. So, perhaps the bird's color is determined by B, and its checkering by c. So, the presence of B results in brown color, and presence of c results in checkered. The presence of C results in red pigment, and presence of c results in plain color.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits. A bird is brown checkered if it has at least one B and at least one c. A bird is brown plain if it has B but not c. A bird is red checkered if it has C but not b. A bird is red plain if it has neither C nor b.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier understanding. Let me re-express:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n   - At least one C \u2192 red.\n   - No C \u2192 plain.\n\n- For Color (B):\n   - At least one B \u2192 brown.\n   - No B \u2192 plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, a bird can be classified into one of four categories:\n\n1. Red Pigmented and Brown Colored: Requires C and B (either order).\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown.\n\n2. Red Pigmented and Plain Colored: Requires C and no B.\n   - Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n3. Plain Pigmented and Brown Colored: Requires no C and B.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n4. Plain Pigmented and Plain Colored: Requires no C and no B.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Now, applying this to the F2 population:\n\nFrom the previous analysis, the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Red Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Red Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\n4. bb (0%) \u2192 Plain Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, but that suggests that 25% are Red Plain and 25% are Plain Plain, giving a 1:1 ratio. But looking back, I thought the phenotypic ratio was 6:2:2:2, but now I'm getting a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each trait, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype, but the combination of both traits may lead to overlapping phenotypes. Let me try again:\n\nFor each F2 bird, their genotype determines their phenotype:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C \u2192 Red pigment.\n   - B \u2192 Brown color.\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown.\n\n- Cc (Red Pigmented):\n   - C \u2192 Red pigment.\n   - b \u2192 Plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n- cc (Plain Pigmented):\n   - c \u2192 Plain pigment.\n   - B \u2192 Brown color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n- bb (Plain Pigmented):\n   - b \u2192 Plain pigment.\n   - b \u2192 Plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because in the F2 generation, the phenotypes wouldn't simply add up like that without considering overlaps. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B, it's Red Brown. If it has C and not B, it's Red Plain. If it has not C and B, it's Brown Plain. And if it has neither, it's Plain Plain. So, each bird falls into one of four phenotypes.\n\nNow, the frequencies of these phenotypes in the F2 generation are proportional to the number of each genotype. Given that:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Red Plain\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Brown Plain\n- bb: 0% \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, so the phenotypic ratio would be 25:50:25:0, or simplifying to 1:2:1:0.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2. No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1. No.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculation of 25:50:25:0. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused Pigmentation and Color. Let me revisit the problem statement:\n\n- Pigment color: C determines pigment color (C=red, c=plain)\n- Color: B determines color (B=brown, b=checkered)\n- Checkered is determined by recessive c.\n\nSo, a bird is checkered (b) only if both alleles are recessive. So, a bird is plain colored (no B) and checkered (both alleles are c). Wait, no, a bird is plain color only if both alleles are recessive for color (i.e., both are b). It's checkered only if both are recessive for pigmentation (c). So, the presence of B makes it brown, and the presence of c makes it checkered. The presence of C makes it red, and the presence of b makes it plain.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe presence of dominant alleles for each trait causes the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n   - C present \u2192 red.\n   - c absent \u2192 plain.\n\n- Color (B):\n   - B present \u2192 brown.\n   - b absent \u2192 plain.\n\nThus, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo, for a bird to be:\n\n- Red Pigmented and Brown Colored: Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown.\n- Red Pigmented and Plain Colored: Has C but no B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Brown Colored: Has no C but has B \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Plain Colored: Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypes have:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Red Brown.\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Red Plain.\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Brown Plain.\n- bb (0%) \u2192 Plain Plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25:0, which simplifies to 1:2:1:0. None of the options reflect this exactly, but option J is 2,6,3,1. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts phenotypes as distinct categories, such as \"red\" for both red and red brown, etc. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf \"red\" includes both red and red brown, \"brown\" includes brown and brown plain, \"checkered\" is plain checkered, and \"plain\" is both plain and plain checkered. Then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nBut that doesn't align with the given options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses \"red\" for all red and red brown, and \"brown\" for brown and brown plain, while \"checkered\" is plain checkered and \"plain\" is both plain and plain checkered. Then:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nStill doesn't match the options.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the problem considers \"red\" as having at least one dominant pigment allele, and \"brown\" as having at least one dominant color allele, but not necessarily considering the checkered state separately. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Brown: 25%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nAgain, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem groups the checkered phenotype under a separate category. For example:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nBut the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. For example, if B is dominant over b, then a bird with at least one B is brown, regardless of c. Similarly, C being dominant over c makes it red, regardless of B. So, a bird can be:\n\n- Red Pigmented and Brown Colored: C and B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown.\n- Red Pigmented and Plain Colored: C and not B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Brown Colored: not C but B \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Plain Colored: neither \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same ratio of 25:50:25:0.\n\nSince none of the answer choices perfectly match this, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me review the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem involves considering the F1 cross instead of the F2 cross. Because the question asks for the F2 generation, but the parent lines are CcBB and ccbb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and then the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Earlier, I assumed the F1 is CcBb, but perhaps the question refers to the F2 as the result of F1 x F1. Let me redo this.\n\nF1 is CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross where one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb. Wait, that's not a standard F1 cross. Normally, a dihybrid cross would involve two different parents, each providing one allele for each gene. Here, the problem describes the parents as CC BB and cc bb, implying that each parent is homozygous for both genes. That seems unusual because typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygous parents for both genes. So, perhaps I've misunderstood the cross setup.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio in terms of phenotypic expression if considering dominance. However, since each gene's effect is independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines both. But in reality, when both genes are considered together, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the possible genotypes and then mapping them to phenotypes. Each bird is determined by two genes, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible genotypes for each trait, but when considering both traits, it's more complex. Alternatively, using a Punnett square for two loci, each with two alleles, considering dominance.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb (each 50%).\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the dominant alleles are present. Let's list each genotype and map to phenotype:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C: red\n- c: plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B: brown\n- b: checkered\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented)\n   - Both C's are dominant, so pigment is red.\n   - Checkered? No, since both are C, so color is brown? Wait, hold on. Wait, the presence of 'B' determines color. So, even though the bird is red (because C is dominant), it's also brown (because B is dominant). So the phenotype is brown checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented)\n   - C is dominant, so red pigment.\n   - c is recessive, so plain color.\n   - Since C is present, the bird is red checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented)\n   - Both c's are recessive, so plain pigment.\n   - Since B is recessive, the bird is plain brown.\n\n4. bb (Plain Pigmented)\n   - Both b's are recessive, so plain pigment.\n   - Since B is recessive, the bird is plain brown.\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. For example, a bird could be Cc (red checkered) and bb (plain brown). Similarly, a bird could be CC (red pigmented) and bb (plain brown).\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype occur in F2:\n\nAssuming a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio when considering two dominant traits, but in this case, it's more complex because each trait is influenced by different alleles. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 population, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since bb is homozygous recessive)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBecause each parent contributes either C or c, and the probabilities combine accordingly. Now, for each genotype, what phenotype do they express?\n\nPhenotype determination is done by checking for dominant alleles:\n\n- For C: any C results in red pigment, regardless of B.\n- For B: any B results in brown color, regardless of c.\n\nSo, let's apply this to each genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C is dominant, so red pigment.\n   - B is not present (since it's CC), so plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain (checkered? Wait, no. Wait, if it's CC, then B isn't expressed because it's recessive. Wait, no: Wait, in the bird, the B is part of the genotype, but the phenotype depends on whether B is present or not. Wait, no, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for the bird to exhibit a particular phenotype, it must have at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing this. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. Each bird has two copies of each gene, and the phenotype reflects the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - If at least one C is present, the bird is red.\n  - Otherwise, it's plain.\n\n- Color (B):\n  - If at least one B is present, the bird is brown.\n  - Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, a bird can be characterized by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C is present \u2192 red pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented):\n   - C is present \u2192 red pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, Cc means at least one C (so red pigment), and at least one c (so plain color). But for the color gene, if B is present, it's brown; else, plain. So for Cc, the presence of C makes it red, and the presence of c makes it plain. So the phenotype is brown plain.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented):\n   - c is present \u2192 plain pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\n4. bb (Plain Pigmented):\n   - b is present \u2192 plain pigment.\n   - B is not present \u2192 plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if you have bb, then both genes are recessive, resulting in plain color and plain pigment. But wait, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, another way: To get a particular phenotype, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nPhenotype: Brown Plain.\n\nTo have this, the bird must have at least one B (for brown) and at least one c (for plain). Wait, no: Let's think differently. The presence of B makes it brown, regardless of c. The presence of c makes it plain, regardless of B. So, a bird that is Cc (has at least one C) and Bb (has at least one B) would be brown checkered.\n\nWait, no, let's take each bird:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented, Plain Color):\n   - Has C \u2192 red.\n   - No B \u2192 plain.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n- Cc (Red Pigmented, Plain Color):\n   - Has C \u2192 red.\n   - No B \u2192 plain.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if it's Cc, it has at least one C, making it red, and at least one c, making it plain. So both traits are expressed. Thus, both traits would be brown and plain, respectively.\n\nWait, but according to the initial problem statement, the color is determined by B, and the checkering by c. So, perhaps the bird's color is determined by B, and its checkering by c. So, the presence of B results in brown color, and presence of c results in checkered. The presence of C results in red pigment, and presence of c results in plain color.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits. A bird is brown checkered if it has at least one B and at least one c. A bird is brown plain if it has B but not c. A bird is red checkered if it has C but not b. A bird is red plain if it has neither C nor b.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier understanding. Let me re-express:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n   - At least one C \u2192 red.\n   - No C \u2192 plain.\n\n- For Color (B):\n   - At least one B \u2192 brown.\n   - No B \u2192 plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, a bird can be classified into one of four categories:\n\n1. Red Pigmented and Brown Colored: Requires C and B (either order).\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown.\n\n2. Red Pigmented and Plain Colored: Requires C and no B.\n   - Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n3. Plain Pigmented and Brown Colored: Requires no C and B.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n4. Plain Pigmented and Plain Colored: Requires no C and no B.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Now, applying this to the F2 population:\n\nFrom the previous analysis, the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Red Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Red Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\n4. bb (0%) \u2192 Plain Pigmented, Plain Color \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, but that suggests that 25% are Red Plain and 25% are Plain Plain, giving a 1:1 ratio. But looking back, I thought the phenotypic ratio was 6:2:2:2, but now I'm getting a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each trait, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype, but the combination of both traits may lead to overlapping phenotypes. Let me try again:\n\nFor each F2 bird, their genotype determines their phenotype:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C \u2192 Red pigment.\n   - B \u2192 Brown color.\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown.\n\n- Cc (Red Pigmented):\n   - C \u2192 Red pigment.\n   - b \u2192 Plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Red Plain.\n\n- cc (Plain Pigmented):\n   - c \u2192 Plain pigment.\n   - B \u2192 Brown color.\n   - Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n\n- bb (Plain Pigmented):\n   - b \u2192 Plain pigment.\n   - b \u2192 Plain color.\n   - Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because in the F2 generation, the phenotypes wouldn't simply add up like that without considering overlaps. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B, it's Red Brown. If it has C and not B, it's Red Plain. If it has not C and B, it's Brown Plain. And if it has neither, it's Plain Plain. So, each bird falls into one of four phenotypes.\n\nNow, the frequencies of these phenotypes in the F2 generation are proportional to the number of each genotype. Given that:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Red Plain\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Brown Plain\n- bb: 0% \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, so the phenotypic ratio would be 25:50:25:0, or simplifying to 1:2:1:0.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2. No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1. No.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculation of 25:50:25:0. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused Pigmentation and Color. Let me revisit the problem statement:\n\n- Pigment color: C determines pigment color (C=red, c=plain)\n- Color: B determines color (B=brown, b=checkered)\n- Checkered is determined by recessive c.\n\nSo, a bird is checkered (b) only if both alleles are recessive. So, a bird is plain colored (no B) and checkered (both alleles are c). Wait, no, a bird is plain color only if both alleles are recessive for color (i.e., both are b). It's checkered only if both are recessive for pigmentation (c). So, the presence of B makes it brown, and the presence of c makes it checkered. The presence of C makes it red, and the presence of b makes it plain.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe presence of dominant alleles for each trait causes the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n   - C present \u2192 red.\n   - c absent \u2192 plain.\n\n- Color (B):\n   - B present \u2192 brown.\n   - b absent \u2192 plain.\n\nThus, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo, for a bird to be:\n\n- Red Pigmented and Brown Colored: Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown.\n- Red Pigmented and Plain Colored: Has C but no B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Brown Colored: Has no C but has B \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Plain Colored: Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypes have:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Red Brown.\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Red Plain.\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Brown Plain.\n- bb (0%) \u2192 Plain Plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25:0, which simplifies to 1:2:1:0. None of the options reflect this exactly, but option J is 2,6,3,1. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts phenotypes as distinct categories, such as \"red\" for both red and red brown, etc. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf \"red\" includes both red and red brown, \"brown\" includes brown and brown plain, \"checkered\" is plain checkered, and \"plain\" is both plain and plain checkered. Then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nBut that doesn't align with the given options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses \"red\" for all red and red brown, and \"brown\" for brown and brown plain, while \"checkered\" is plain checkered and \"plain\" is both plain and plain checkered. Then:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nStill doesn't match the options.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the problem considers \"red\" as having at least one dominant pigment allele, and \"brown\" as having at least one dominant color allele, but not necessarily considering the checkered state separately. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Brown: 25%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nAgain, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem groups the checkered phenotype under a separate category. For example:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Checkered: 0%\n- Plain: 0%\n\nBut the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. For example, if B is dominant over b, then a bird with at least one B is brown, regardless of c. Similarly, C being dominant over c makes it red, regardless of B. So, a bird can be:\n\n- Red Pigmented and Brown Colored: C and B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown.\n- Red Pigmented and Plain Colored: C and not B \u2192 Phenotype: Red Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Brown Colored: not C but B \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain.\n- Plain Pigmented and Plain Colored: neither \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Plain.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same ratio of 25:50:25:0.\n\nSince none of the answer choices perfectly match this, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me review the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem involves considering the F1 cross instead of the F2 cross. Because the question asks for the F2 generation, but the parent lines are CcBB and ccbb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and then the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Earlier, I assumed the F1 is CcBb, but perhaps the question refers to the F2 as the result of F1 x F1. Let me redo this.\n\nF1 is CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross where one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb. Wait, that's not a standard F1 cross. Normally, a dihybrid cross would involve two different parents, each providing one allele for each gene. Here, the problem describes the parents as CC BB and cc bb, implying that each parent is homozygous for both genes. That seems unusual because typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygous parents for both genes. So, perhaps I've misunderstood the cross setup.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B,",

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming dominance, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are present.",
    "rollout": " Assuming dominance, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are present.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the phenotype. So for pigment color, if there's at least one C, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, for color, if at least one B, it's brown; else, checkered. So the possible phenotypes are: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. Now, the F2 generation will have all four combinations of these, depending on how many of each gene is present.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratios, we'll consider the frequency of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC: C present \u2192 red\n- Cc: C present \u2192 red\n- cc: c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- BB: B present \u2192 brown\n- Bb: B present \u2192 brown\n- bb: b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes will be a combination of these. However, calculating the exact counts requires knowing the probability distribution for each gene. Since each gene is assorting independently, the total F2 population will have a combined probability for each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Punnett square approach. Let's construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 from F1 selfing (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB (red brown)\n- From CB + cb: Cc BB (red brown)\n- From cb + CB: cc BB (plain brown)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nBut wait, this seems off. Because each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red brown)\n2. Cc BB (red brown)\n3. cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotype for each:\n\n- CC BB: red brown\n- Cc BB: red brown\n- cc BB: plain brown\n- cc bb: checkered brown\n\nSo the phenotypic categories are: red brown, red brown, plain brown, checkered brown.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gamete is equally likely (25% chance for each), the proportion for each phenotype will depend on how often each genotype appears.\n\nEach F2 individual has a 25% chance of being each genotype. But some genotypes lead to different phenotypes. Specifically:\n\n- Both C and B are present: red brown (phenotype A)\n- C present, B absent: plain brown (phenotype B)\n- C absent, B present: checkered brown (phenotype D)\n- Both C and B absent: checkered brown? Wait, no\u2014both c and b are absent, so all four alleles are recessive. Wait, no: cc bb is both recessive. So that's checkered brown (phenotype C).\n\nWait, but in reality, since both genes are recessive, the phenotype depends on both. So, the F2 individuals can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (phenotype A)\n2. Cc BB \u2192 red brown (A)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (B)\n4. cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (C)\n\nEach of these four groups has a 25% chance of occurring. However, among them:\n\n- CC BB and Cc BB both have both C and B dominant, so they are red brown.\n- cc BB has both recessive, so plain brown.\n- cc bb has both recessive, so checkered brown.\n\nTherefore, in terms of phenotype ratios:\n\n- A (red brown): 50% (since two of four)\n- B (plain brown): 25%\n- C (checkered brown): 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because each group is 25%, but A includes two groups, so 50%. B and C are each 25%.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them have a 50/50 split. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the F2 generation. The F2 should include all possible combinations of the four alleles, but according to our earlier analysis, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present or not.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of thinking in terms of genotypes, think directly in terms of phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype A: both C and B are present \u2192 red brown (60%)\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 plain brown (20%)\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 checkered brown (20%)\n\nPhenotype D: neither C nor B present \u2192 checkered brown (0%) Wait, no\u2014if both are absent, then it's checkered brown. If any of the genes is present, it's red or plain.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the presence of either allele results in the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, the bird is red or plain, respectively. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate because each gene acts independently. So, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the F2 as having a 3:1 ratio for each gene, and combine those.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene operates independently, so the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene. However, the overall phenotype will depend on both genes.\n\nAnother way: Each gene has a 3:1 ratio of presence to absence. So, for pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence: 3/4 (red)\n- Absence: 1/4 (plain)\n\nSimilarly for color (B):\n\n- Presence: 3/4 (brown)\n- Absence: 1/4 (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of these probabilities. However, the phenotypic categories are combinations of these:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 red brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 plain brown\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 checkered brown\n\nAdding up these fractions:\n\n- 9/16 red brown\n- 3/16 plain brown\n- 3/16 checkered brown\n- 1/16 checkered brown (from option E above?)\n\nWait, but that adds up to (9+3+3+1)/16 = 16/16=1. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut that can't be right because in reality, the presence of any dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. So, the actual phenotypic ratio would be based on the presence of each allele, not just the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F2 generation comes from the F1 cross, which was CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The F2 will have the following possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes because they're homozygous. So the F2 will have four types of gametes, each 25%: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can only give CB or cb, so F2 will have gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with 25% chance. Wait, but cB is the same as bc, but the order doesn't matter in terms of phenotype. So effectively, the gametes are CB, cb, and two others (but they might be the same). Actually, each parent can only give CB or cb, so F2 will have gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014the F2 will have four possible gametes, but each is 25%: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But cB is the same as bc, but in terms of phenotype, cb and bc are the same, so the gametes are CB, cb, and two identical ones (cb and bc). So in terms of phenotypes, it's CB, cb, and plain.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have gametes CB and cb, each at 50% chance. Thus, the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (red brown)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB (red brown)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nEach of these happens with 25% probability. Now, determining the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown (A)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown (A)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown (B)\n- cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (C)\n\nThus, in terms of phenotype ratios:\n\n- A: 50% (two out of four)\n- B: 25%\n- C: 25%\n\nWait, but the options don't have a 50/50 split. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions G through J have various ratios, including 12:2:2:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. None of them have a 50/50 split. Maybe I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering each genotype separately, consider the phenotypic ratios based on the dominance of each gene. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering the combination of their effects.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio of presence to absence (dominant: recessive). So, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of these probabilities, but adjusted for the specific phenotypes observed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look at the possible phenotypes and their counts. In F2:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both genes are recessive (cc bb). So, 1/16 of the population.\n\n- Checkered brown: Occurs when B is present but b is absent (cc BB). So, 3/16.\n\n- Plain red: Occurs when C is present but b is absent (Cc BB). So, 3/16.\n\n- Checkered brown: Wait, no\u2014this could also occur when both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nActually, the phenotypes are:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C and B dominant): red brown (A)\n- If C present, B absent: plain brown (B)\n- If C absent, B present: checkered brown (C)\n- If both C and B absent: checkered brown (D)\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): red brown\n- Only C dominant (C present, B absent): plain brown\n- Only B dominant (B present, C absent): checkered brown\n- Neither dominant: checkered brown\n\nBut in reality, since both genes are acting independently, the presence of either dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present: red brown\n2. C present, B absent: plain brown\n3. B present, C absent: checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: checkered brown\n\nIn terms of counts:\n\n- 1: 9/16 (red brown)\n- 2: 3/16 (plain brown)\n- 3: 3/16 (checkered brown)\n- 4: 1/16 (checkered brown)\n\nTotal: 16/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options provided, none match this exactly. Option G has 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Option H has 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. Option F has 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option D has 2:6:3:9, summing to 20. Option C has 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which aligns with our analysis. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming dominance, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are present.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the phenotype. So for pigment color, if there's at least one C, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, for color, if at least one B, it's brown; else, checkered. So the possible phenotypes are: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. Now, the F2 generation will have all four combinations of these, depending on how many of each gene is present.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratios, we'll consider the frequency of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC: C present \u2192 red\n- Cc: C present \u2192 red\n- cc: c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- BB: B present \u2192 brown\n- Bb: B present \u2192 brown\n- bb: b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes will be a combination of these. However, calculating the exact counts requires knowing the probability distribution for each gene. Since each gene is assorting independently, the total F2 population will have a combined probability for each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Punnett square approach. Let's construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 from F1 selfing (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB (red brown)\n- From CB + cb: Cc BB (red brown)\n- From cb + CB: cc BB (plain brown)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nBut wait, this seems off. Because each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red brown)\n2. Cc BB (red brown)\n3. cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotype for each:\n\n- CC BB: red brown\n- Cc BB: red brown\n- cc BB: plain brown\n- cc bb: checkered brown\n\nSo the phenotypic categories are: red brown, red brown, plain brown, checkered brown.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gamete is equally likely (25% chance for each), the proportion for each phenotype will depend on how often each genotype appears.\n\nEach F2 individual has a 25% chance of being each genotype. But some genotypes lead to different phenotypes. Specifically:\n\n- Both C and B are present: red brown (phenotype A)\n- C present, B absent: plain brown (phenotype B)\n- C absent, B present: checkered brown (phenotype D)\n- Both C and B absent: checkered brown? Wait, no\u2014both c and b are absent, so all four alleles are recessive. Wait, no: cc bb is both recessive. So that's checkered brown (phenotype C).\n\nWait, but in reality, since both genes are recessive, the phenotype depends on both. So, the F2 individuals can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (phenotype A)\n2. Cc BB \u2192 red brown (A)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (B)\n4. cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (C)\n\nEach of these four groups has a 25% chance of occurring. However, among them:\n\n- CC BB and Cc BB both have both C and B dominant, so they are red brown.\n- cc BB has both recessive, so plain brown.\n- cc bb has both recessive, so checkered brown.\n\nTherefore, in terms of phenotype ratios:\n\n- A (red brown): 50% (since two of four)\n- B (plain brown): 25%\n- C (checkered brown): 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because each group is 25%, but A includes two groups, so 50%. B and C are each 25%.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them have a 50/50 split. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the F2 generation. The F2 should include all possible combinations of the four alleles, but according to our earlier analysis, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present or not.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of thinking in terms of genotypes, think directly in terms of phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype A: both C and B are present \u2192 red brown (60%)\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 plain brown (20%)\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 checkered brown (20%)\n\nPhenotype D: neither C nor B present \u2192 checkered brown (0%) Wait, no\u2014if both are absent, then it's checkered brown. If any of the genes is present, it's red or plain.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the presence of either allele results in the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, the bird is red or plain, respectively. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate because each gene acts independently. So, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the F2 as having a 3:1 ratio for each gene, and combine those.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene operates independently, so the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene. However, the overall phenotype will depend on both genes.\n\nAnother way: Each gene has a 3:1 ratio of presence to absence. So, for pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence: 3/4 (red)\n- Absence: 1/4 (plain)\n\nSimilarly for color (B):\n\n- Presence: 3/4 (brown)\n- Absence: 1/4 (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of these probabilities. However, the phenotypic categories are combinations of these:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 red brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 plain brown\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 checkered brown\n\nAdding up these fractions:\n\n- 9/16 red brown\n- 3/16 plain brown\n- 3/16 checkered brown\n- 1/16 checkered brown (from option E above?)\n\nWait, but that adds up to (9+3+3+1)/16 = 16/16=1. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut that can't be right because in reality, the presence of any dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. So, the actual phenotypic ratio would be based on the presence of each allele, not just the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F2 generation comes from the F1 cross, which was CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The F2 will have the following possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes because they're homozygous. So the F2 will have four types of gametes, each 25%: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can only give CB or cb, so F2 will have gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with 25% chance. Wait, but cB is the same as bc, but the order doesn't matter in terms of phenotype. So effectively, the gametes are CB, cb, and two others (but they might be the same). Actually, each parent can only give CB or cb, so F2 will have gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014the F2 will have four possible gametes, but each is 25%: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But cB is the same as bc, but in terms of phenotype, cb and bc are the same, so the gametes are CB, cb, and two identical ones (cb and bc). So in terms of phenotypes, it's CB, cb, and plain.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have gametes CB and cb, each at 50% chance. Thus, the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (red brown)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB (red brown)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nEach of these happens with 25% probability. Now, determining the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown (A)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown (A)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown (B)\n- cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (C)\n\nThus, in terms of phenotype ratios:\n\n- A: 50% (two out of four)\n- B: 25%\n- C: 25%\n\nWait, but the options don't have a 50/50 split. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions G through J have various ratios, including 12:2:2:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. None of them have a 50/50 split. Maybe I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering each genotype separately, consider the phenotypic ratios based on the dominance of each gene. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering the combination of their effects.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio of presence to absence (dominant: recessive). So, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of these probabilities, but adjusted for the specific phenotypes observed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look at the possible phenotypes and their counts. In F2:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both genes are recessive (cc bb). So, 1/16 of the population.\n\n- Checkered brown: Occurs when B is present but b is absent (cc BB). So, 3/16.\n\n- Plain red: Occurs when C is present but b is absent (Cc BB). So, 3/16.\n\n- Checkered brown: Wait, no\u2014this could also occur when both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nActually, the phenotypes are:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C and B dominant): red brown (A)\n- If C present, B absent: plain brown (B)\n- If C absent, B present: checkered brown (C)\n- If both C and B absent: checkered brown (D)\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): red brown\n- Only C dominant (C present, B absent): plain brown\n- Only B dominant (B present, C absent): checkered brown\n- Neither dominant: checkered brown\n\nBut in reality, since both genes are acting independently, the presence of either dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present: red brown\n2. C present, B absent: plain brown\n3. B present, C absent: checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: checkered brown\n\nIn terms of counts:\n\n- 1: 9/16 (red brown)\n- 2: 3/16 (plain brown)\n- 3: 3/16 (checkered brown)\n- 4: 1/16 (checkered brown)\n\nTotal: 16/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options provided, none match this exactly. Option G has 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Option H has 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. Option F has 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option D has 2:6:3:9, summing to 20. Option C has 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which aligns with our analysis.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two possible phenotypes.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are two possible phenotypes. Since the genes are linked or independent, but in this case, I think they are independent. So the total phenotypic combinations are 2 x 2 = 4: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include any such specific ratios. They seem to provide general counts like \"checkered red 6\" etc. So perhaps I need to calculate how many offspring fall into each category based on their genotypes.\n\nLet me consider the F2 generation. The F2 will have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) \u2192 phenotype: checkered red\n2. CC bb (homozygous for C and recessive for B) \u2192 phenotype: checkered brown\n3. cc BB (recessive for C and dominant for B) \u2192 phenotype: plain red\n4. cc bb (recessive for both) \u2192 phenotype: plain brown\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the probability of each genotype is:\n\nFor C: (1/2)^2 = 1/4 (for CC), 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 (for Cc), 1/2^2 = 1/4 (for cc)\n\nSimilarly for B: same probabilities.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\n- CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut wait, this isn't correct because if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then the F2 would have different probabilities due to independent assortment. Alternatively, if both parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another, the calculations change. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our case, Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both). Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will result from selfing CcBb. So, the F2 will have four genotypes as I listed before, each with a probability of 1/16. However, wait\u2014that doesn't sound right because the F2 generation in such cases typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but here the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Let me re-examine the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all four genotypes have equal probabilities. Wait, actually, for dihybrids, when both parents are homozygous (e.g., one is CC BB and the other is cc bb), the F2 will have a 1:2:1:1 distribution among the phenotypes, but let's confirm.\n\nNo, wait, that's not correct. In dihybrid crosses where both parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 will have a 1:2:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. Because each gene is segregating independently. So for each gene, the probability of each outcome is 1/2. Since there are two genes, the total number of phenotypic categories is 2x2=4. Each combination occurs with probability (1/2)^2 for each gene, leading to each phenotype having a probability of 1/4. Wait, that seems off because the sum would be 4*(1/4)=1, which is correct. So each phenotype would occur 25% of the time.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red (CC BB) \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- Checkered brown (CC bb) \u2192 1/4\n- Plain red (cc BB) \u2192 1/4\n- Plain brown (cc bb) \u2192 1/4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, or equally distributed among the four phenotypes. But looking back at the answer choices, none of them list a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, they vary from 1:2:6:2 to others. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood something.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about the assumption that the parents are homozygous for both genes. Wait, the problem states that one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb. Yes, that's what I thought earlier. So the F2 would indeed have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer options match this. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 4:4:0:4, etc. None of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that my approach might be flawed. Perhaps I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both genes. Maybe one parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both). That's what I assumed earlier. Alternatively, maybe the parents are heterozygous for both genes, but the question says they are homozygous. Wait, the question says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\" So, yeah, both parents are homozygous for both traits.\n\nGiven that, the F2 should have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the answer options do not reflect this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the genotypes. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the dihybrid cross without relying solely on the simple Mendelian ratios. Let's use a Punnett square approach properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u00d7 Parent 2: cc bb\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele for each gene). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- From each parent, possible gametes: CB and cb\n- Combining the gametes:\n\n  - CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n  - CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%, but different than above)\n  - cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (another 25%, different from above)\n  - cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no, because when you combine the gametes, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes either CB or cb, then the possible combinations are:\n\nFrom Parent 1: CB or cb\nFrom Parent 2: CB or cb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo each of these four combinations happens with equal probability (25%), resulting in four F2 genotypes: CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, and ccbb.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb \u2192 same as above \u2192 checkered red (but same as each other)\n- CcBb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n- ccbb \u2192 c and b \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no, because each F2 individual will express their phenotype based on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- CcBb: has C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb: same as above \u2192 checkered red (but same as others)\n- CcBb: same \u2192 checkered red\n- ccbb: has c and b \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut this still results in four phenotypes, each with 25% frequency, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, none of the answer options match this. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh! Wait, perhaps \"adihybridcross\" refers to a dihybrid cross where both parents are considered. Wait, but in this case, the parents are already homozygous. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a cross where one parent is a homozygous dominant for one trait and a homozygous recessive for another, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's read the question again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh, now I see. Wait, the term \"adihybridcross\" might refer to a cross involving two genes, each potentially affecting the phenotype. But the way it's phrased, it's a cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, but each bird has two genes: one controlling pigment color (C/B) and one controlling pigmentation (B/b). So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between two birds, each being homozygous for one gene.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a dihybrid cross between two parents, each with two dominant and two recessive alleles. Wait, no, because the parents are homozygous for both traits. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that each bird is homozygous for both genes. Therefore, when crossed, the F1 is also homozygous for both genes, and the F2 is the classic 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the question specifies an adihybridcross, which usually involves two different traits. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is intended to refer to a dihybrid cross between two birds, each being homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. But the way it's written is confusing. Let me try to parse it again.\n\nThe question says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"adihybrid\" refers to a cross between two organisms that are each dihybrids. But in this case, the parents are homozygous for both genes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and it's supposed to be a dihybrid cross between two heterozygotes.\n\nAssuming that the parents are dihybrids (i.e., CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the question specifically mentions a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where each parent is dihybrid, but that contradicts the description. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant and a homozygous recessive for one trait, but that seems odd.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's proceed under the assumption that the parents are dihybrids (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb), even though the question describes them as homozygous. If that's the case, then the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, with phenotypes in the order checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).\n\nLooking at the answer options, option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which is inverted. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which is reversed again. Option J is similar but inverted. Option C is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" which sums up to 22, but the total should be 16. Option F is 1+1+1+1=4, which is too low. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which adds to 16 but represents a different ratio. Option B is 8:4:0:4, adding to 16, but the numbers don't fit the 9:3:3:1 pattern. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which sums to 16 but doesn't match the ratio. Option G is the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possible phenotypes. Since the genes are linked or independent, but in this case, I think they are independent. So the total phenotypic combinations are 2 x 2 = 4: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include any such specific ratios. They seem to provide general counts like \"checkered red 6\" etc. So perhaps I need to calculate how many offspring fall into each category based on their genotypes.\n\nLet me consider the F2 generation. The F2 will have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) \u2192 phenotype: checkered red\n2. CC bb (homozygous for C and recessive for B) \u2192 phenotype: checkered brown\n3. cc BB (recessive for C and dominant for B) \u2192 phenotype: plain red\n4. cc bb (recessive for both) \u2192 phenotype: plain brown\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the probability of each genotype is:\n\nFor C: (1/2)^2 = 1/4 (for CC), 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 (for Cc), 1/2^2 = 1/4 (for cc)\n\nSimilarly for B: same probabilities.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\n- CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut wait, this isn't correct because if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then the F2 would have different probabilities due to independent assortment. Alternatively, if both parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another, the calculations change. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our case, Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both). Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will result from selfing CcBb. So, the F2 will have four genotypes as I listed before, each with a probability of 1/16. However, wait\u2014that doesn't sound right because the F2 generation in such cases typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but here the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Let me re-examine the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all four genotypes have equal probabilities. Wait, actually, for dihybrids, when both parents are homozygous (e.g., one is CC BB and the other is cc bb), the F2 will have a 1:2:1:1 distribution among the phenotypes, but let's confirm.\n\nNo, wait, that's not correct. In dihybrid crosses where both parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 will have a 1:2:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. Because each gene is segregating independently. So for each gene, the probability of each outcome is 1/2. Since there are two genes, the total number of phenotypic categories is 2x2=4. Each combination occurs with probability (1/2)^2 for each gene, leading to each phenotype having a probability of 1/4. Wait, that seems off because the sum would be 4*(1/4)=1, which is correct. So each phenotype would occur 25% of the time.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red (CC BB) \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- Checkered brown (CC bb) \u2192 1/4\n- Plain red (cc BB) \u2192 1/4\n- Plain brown (cc bb) \u2192 1/4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, or equally distributed among the four phenotypes. But looking back at the answer choices, none of them list a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, they vary from 1:2:6:2 to others. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood something.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about the assumption that the parents are homozygous for both genes. Wait, the problem states that one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb. Yes, that's what I thought earlier. So the F2 would indeed have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer options match this. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 4:4:0:4, etc. None of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that my approach might be flawed. Perhaps I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both genes. Maybe one parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both). That's what I assumed earlier. Alternatively, maybe the parents are heterozygous for both genes, but the question says they are homozygous. Wait, the question says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\" So, yeah, both parents are homozygous for both traits.\n\nGiven that, the F2 should have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the answer options do not reflect this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the genotypes. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the dihybrid cross without relying solely on the simple Mendelian ratios. Let's use a Punnett square approach properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u00d7 Parent 2: cc bb\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele for each gene). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- From each parent, possible gametes: CB and cb\n- Combining the gametes:\n\n  - CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n  - CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%, but different than above)\n  - cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (another 25%, different from above)\n  - cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no, because when you combine the gametes, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes either CB or cb, then the possible combinations are:\n\nFrom Parent 1: CB or cb\nFrom Parent 2: CB or cb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo each of these four combinations happens with equal probability (25%), resulting in four F2 genotypes: CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, and ccbb.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb \u2192 same as above \u2192 checkered red (but same as each other)\n- CcBb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n- ccbb \u2192 c and b \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no, because each F2 individual will express their phenotype based on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- CcBb: has C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb: same as above \u2192 checkered red (but same as others)\n- CcBb: same \u2192 checkered red\n- ccbb: has c and b \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut this still results in four phenotypes, each with 25% frequency, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, none of the answer options match this. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh! Wait, perhaps \"adihybridcross\" refers to a dihybrid cross where both parents are considered. Wait, but in this case, the parents are already homozygous. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a cross where one parent is a homozygous dominant for one trait and a homozygous recessive for another, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's read the question again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh, now I see. Wait, the term \"adihybridcross\" might refer to a cross involving two genes, each potentially affecting the phenotype. But the way it's phrased, it's a cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, but each bird has two genes: one controlling pigment color (C/B) and one controlling pigmentation (B/b). So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between two birds, each being homozygous for one gene.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a dihybrid cross between two parents, each with two dominant and two recessive alleles. Wait, no, because the parents are homozygous for both traits. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that each bird is homozygous for both genes. Therefore, when crossed, the F1 is also homozygous for both genes, and the F2 is the classic 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the question specifies an adihybridcross, which usually involves two different traits. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is intended to refer to a dihybrid cross between two birds, each being homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. But the way it's written is confusing. Let me try to parse it again.\n\nThe question says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"adihybrid\" refers to a cross between two organisms that are each dihybrids. But in this case, the parents are homozygous for both genes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and it's supposed to be a dihybrid cross between two heterozygotes.\n\nAssuming that the parents are dihybrids (i.e., CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the question specifically mentions a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where each parent is dihybrid, but that contradicts the description. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant and a homozygous recessive for one trait, but that seems odd.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's proceed under the assumption that the parents are dihybrids (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb), even though the question describes them as homozygous. If that's the case, then the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, with phenotypes in the order checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).\n\nLooking at the answer options, option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which is inverted. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which is reversed again. Option J is similar but inverted. Option C is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" which sums up to 22, but the total should be 16. Option F is 1+1+1+1=4, which is too low. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which adds to 16 but represents a different ratio. Option B is 8:4:0:4, adding to 16, but the numbers don't fit the 9:3:3:1 pattern. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which sums to 16 but doesn't match the ratio. Option G is the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Assuming each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for each gene.",
    "rollout": " Assuming each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for each gene. But since we have two genes, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant: recessive). Since there are two independent genes, the total phenotypic ratios would involve multiplying the possibilities. So for each gene, the phenotypic outcome is 3:1, leading to a total of 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratios across both genes. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, the correct way is to consider the phenotypic ratios for each gene separately and then combine them. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is 3x3 = 9 parts for each combination. So for two traits, there are nine possible phenotypic combinations. But in reality, some of these may overlap if the traits are linked or expressed together. However, since the question mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" without specifying overlapping, we'll proceed under the assumption that each phenotype is distinct.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options given don't include 9:3:3:1. Instead, the options are various ratios like 6:2:6:2 (A), 8:4:0:4 (B), etc. This suggests that the user might be considering only certain phenotypes, possibly those where both genes are expressed, or perhaps some are grouped into categories due to dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, focusing on the phenotypes that result from the dominance of each trait, ignoring any epistatic interactions. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the phenotypic expression based solely on the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of dominance relationships.\n\nGiven the options provided, let's calculate the expected phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the presence of dominant alleles leads to a particular phenotype. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but depending on whether the genes are assorting independently and whether the traits are completely dominant, some phenotypes may merge.\n\nHowever, the options given do not include 9:3:3:1. Instead, option D is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't make sense because the highest number should be 9, not 3. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems odd. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio based on the actual observed phenotypes in the F2 generation, considering dominance and blending.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The F2 generation will have the following genotypes based on the dihybrid cross:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous red-brown)\n2. CC bb (homozygous red-checkered)\n3. cc BB (recessive red-brown)\n4. cc bb (recessive checkered)\n\nBut wait, in reality, the F2 will have more than four genotypes due to independent assortment. Each gene segregates into three possibilities (for each gene), leading to 3x3=9 possible phenotypic combinations. However, some of these may lead to the same phenotype if the traits are additive or expressed together.\n\nBut according to the user's options, the possible answers don't include 9:3:3:1. Instead, the closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because 12+2+2+0=16, which is less than 16 possible offspring (since each F2 individual comes from a 9:3:3:1 ratio, totaling 16).\n\nWait, perhaps the user confused F2 with another generation. Let me clarify the generations: F1 is the first cross (parents CC BB and cc bb), resulting in all CcBb. F2 is the selfing of F1, which results in the F2 generation described earlier.\n\nIn F2, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. For each gene, the presence of dominant allele (C for pigment, B for color) results in the respective phenotype. The phenotypic ratio would thus be based on how many of the F2 individuals have dominant alleles for both genes, dominant for one and recessive for the other, etc.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CC bb: Pigment red (C), Color checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. cc bb: Pigment plain (c), Color checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the segregation, each gene segregates independently. In F2, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - Presence of C: 3/4 (reddish)\n  - Absence of C: 1/4 (plain)\n  \n- For color (B):\n  - Presence of B: 3/4 (brown)\n  - Absence of B: 1/4 (checkered)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of a specific combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options provided match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't align\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Closest, but the numbers sum to 16, but the pheno ratio is 9:3:3:1.\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Reversed\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Again reversed\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equal, unlikely\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption K: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 As above\n\nNone of the options directly match 9:3:3:1. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but doesn't align with our calculations. Maybe the user included additional factors or miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the user considered only the presence of dominant alleles, excluding the recessive ones. For example, in the case of checkered red (C and b), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user miscalculated the number of phenotypes. Let's recalculate:\n\nEach F2 individual will be:\n\n- 9/16 CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 3/16 CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n- 3/16 cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 1/16 cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nBut considering the options provided, none perfectly matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option G sums to 16 (12+2+2+0=16), but it's structured as checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't reflect the 9:3:3:1 distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included only the dominant phenotypes, but that would mean checkered red (9), plain red (3), checkered brown (3), and plain brown (1). But none of the options sum to 16. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer intended is option G, but it's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask a different question.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible is option G, even though it doesn't fully match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user presented the options incorrectly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user considered only the presence of dominant alleles, treating each phenotype as a binary (dominant or recessive), leading to 4 phenotypes. However, in reality, the phenotypes are based on the interaction of two traits, leading to four possible phenotypic classes.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll choose the closest option, which is option G, even though it's not mathematically accurate based on the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended option G, thinking that the checkered phenotype dominates, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial setup, the F2 generation is being analyzed for phenotypic ratios. The user's options suggest that option G is the correct one, despite my doubts. So I'll go with option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but doesn't align with our calculations. Maybe the user included additional factors or miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the user considered only the presence of dominant alleles, excluding the recessive ones. For example, in the case of checkered red (C and b), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user miscalculated the number of phenotypes. Let's recalculate:\n\nEach F2 individual will be:\n\n- 9/16 CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 3/16 CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n- 3/16 cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 1/16 cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nBut considering the options provided, none perfectly matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option G sums to 16 (12+2+2+0=16), but it's structured as checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't reflect the 9:3:3:1 distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included only the dominant phenotypes, but that would mean checkered red (9), plain red (3), checkered brown (3), and plain brown (1). But none of the options sum to 16. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer intended is option G, but it's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask a different question.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible is option G, even though it doesn't fully match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user presented the options incorrectly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user considered only the presence of dominant alleles, treating each phenotype as a binary (dominant or recessive), leading to 4 phenotypes. However, in reality, the phenotypes are based on the interaction of two traits, leading to four possible phenotypic classes.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll choose the closest option, which is option G, even though it's not mathematically accurate based on the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended option G, thinking that the checkered phenotype dominates, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial setup, the F2 generation is being analyzed for phenotypic ratios. The user's options suggest that option G is the correct one, despite my doubts. So I'll go with option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic classes. However, the user mentions only \"checkered red,\" \"checkered brown,\" \"plain red,\" \"plain brown.\" That suggests that the phenotype depends on whether the pigment is dominant (red) or recessive (plain), regardless of color. Similarly, the color depends on whether the pigment is dominant (brown) or recessive (checkered). Therefore, the phenotypic classes are determined by the presence/absence of the dominant alleles for both genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (Red Brown)\n2. C dominant, B recessive (Plain Brown)\n3. C recessive, B dominant (Checkered Brown)\n4. Both C and B recessive (Plain Checkered)\n\nWait, but the options given don't include these exact terms. Instead, the options mention \"checkered red,\" \"checkered brown,\" \"plain red,\" and \"plain brown.\" That implies that the presence of dominant alleles results in different phenotypes than the recessive ones. So let's map the dominance. Pigment: C is dominant (Red), c is recessive (Plain). Color: B is dominant (Brown), b is recessive (Checkered). Therefore, the phenotype will depend on the combination of these traits.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), then it's either red or plain. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), then it's either brown or checkered. But the way the options are phrased suggests that the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for both genes. So the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n- Both dominant: Red Brown (highest phenotype)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Plain Brown\n- C recessive, B dominant: Checkered Brown\n- Both recessive: Plain Checkered (lowest phenotype)\n\nNow, the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation depends on the probability of each genotype contributing to the next generation. From the Punnett square analysis, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (Red Brown): 25%\n- CC Bb (Red Checkered): 25%\n- CC bb (Plain Brown): 25%\n- Cc BB (Red Brown): 25%\n- Cc Bb (Red Checkered): 25%\n- Cc bb (Plain Brown): 25%\n- cc BB (Plain Brown): 25%\n- cc Bb (Checkered Brown): 25%\n- cc bb (Plain Checkered): 25%\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The F2 genotypes aren't equally distributed across all four phenotypes because each gene is segregating independently. So the probabilities for each trait are multiplied. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- Probability of C present (Red): \u00be (since \u00bc are cc)\n- Probability of C absent (Plain): \u00bc\n\nFor Color (B):\n- Probability of B present (Brown): \u00be\n- Probability of B absent (Checkered): \u00bc\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Red Brown: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- Red Checkered: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- Plain Brown: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic distribution in the F2 generation would be approximately 9 parts Red Brown, 3 parts Red Checkered, 3 parts Plain Brown, and 1 part Plain Checkered. \n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match our calculation where Red Brown is 9 and Red Checkered is 3. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That seems off. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, similar issue. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Close, but not exactly what we have.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something in the calculations. Let me double-check. The total F2 population is 16. The counts per phenotype would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nWhich adds up to 16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to option D, which states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but in our case, checkered red would correspond to Plain Brown in our earlier mapping, but according to the options, checkered red is being counted as separate. Maybe I got confused in the initial description. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user labeled the phenotypes differently. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions A through J list specific numbers for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.

So matching this to the options, it's option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

Let me clarify: \n- The presence of C is dominant over c.\n- The presence of B is dominant over b.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether C is present (Red) or not (Plain), and whether B is present (Brown) or not (Checkered).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n1.

Red Plain (cccc): Neither C nor B present.\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nFor each gene, there are 3:1 ratios, so for two genes:\n\nTotal F2 = 3^2 * 3^2 = 9*9=81 possible phenotypes, but considering dominance, some phenotypes merge.\n\nAlternatively, for each bird, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (C_B_) = (probability of C present) * (probability of B present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 36%\n- Checkered Plain: (C_bb) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 22.22%\n- Red Brown: (cc_B_) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 22.22%\n- Red Plain: (cccc) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9 \u2192 ~11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 36 + 22.22 + 22.22 + 11.11 \u2248 91.55%, which seems off because the sum must be 100%. Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe instead, I should calculate the actual counts based on the Punnett squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for dihybrid crosses.

Alternatively, the 9:3:3:1 ratio is broken down into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.

So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 9 parts\n- Checkered Plain: 3 parts\n- Red Brown: 3 parts\n- Red Plain: 1 part\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, but since the overall ratio is 9:3:3:1, the actual counts depend on the total population.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the presence of C leads to red, and presence of B leads to brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So the phenotypic ratio for each gene is 3:1. Combining them, the total phenotype ratio is 3\u00d73=9 parts. So 9 phenotypic categories. However, some phenotypes may overlap if certain combinations don't occur. Let's see:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n1. Checkered red (C c B b \u2192 C present, b present)\n2. Checkered brown (C c b b \u2192 C present, b present, but B is absent)\nWait, no. Let me clarify: \n- The presence of C is dominant over c.\n- The presence of B is dominant over b.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether C is present (Red) or not (Plain), and whether B is present (Brown) or not (Checkered).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Plain (C_bb)\n3. C absent, B present: Red Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Both C and B absent: Red Plain (cccc)\n\nBut wait, in reality, the presence of C and B together might not always lead to specific colors, but given the dominance hierarchy, it's more accurate to consider the phenotypes based on the presence/absence of the dominant alleles.\n\nNow, calculating the F2 phenotypic ratio:\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive), so combined, the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to 9 phenotypic categories. However, some categories might combine into fewer phenotypes due to overlapping conditions.\n\nLet me list all possible phenotypes along with their counts:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_): This occurs when C is present (at least one C allele) and B is present (at least one B allele).\n2. Checkered Plain (C_bb): C present, B absent.\n3. Red Brown (cc_B_): C absent, B present.\n4. Red Plain (cccc): Neither C nor B present.\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nFor each gene, there are 3:1 ratios, so for two genes:\n\nTotal F2 = 3^2 * 3^2 = 9*9=81 possible phenotypes, but considering dominance, some phenotypes merge.\n\nAlternatively, for each bird, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (C_B_) = (probability of C present) * (probability of B present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 36%\n- Checkered Plain: (C_bb) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 22.22%\n- Red Brown: (cc_B_) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 22.22%\n- Red Plain: (cccc) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9 \u2192 ~11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 36 + 22.22 + 22.22 + 11.11 \u2248 91.55%, which seems off because the sum must be 100%.

However, without knowing the total number of birds, we can express the ratio as 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly except option D, which is 1, 3, 9, 3.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since both C and B are present)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (only B present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (no C, but B present)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (both C and B present)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (no C, B present)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (no C, no B)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (no C, B present)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (no C, no B)\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that seems too many. Actually, for each gene, there are two possibilities, so the total phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C present, B absent\n- Checkered Brown: C present, B present\n- Plain Brown: C absent, B present\n- Plain Red: C absent, B absent\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category based on the Punnett square.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would have the following possibilities:\n\n- From the F1 (CcBb), each gamete is CB or cb.\nSo the F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach might be confusing. Instead, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 would have the following:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the probability is 25% for each outcome. But since we have two genes, the combined probability is 25% for each phenotype combination.\n\nHowever, some phenotypes may overlap if a phenotype is influenced by multiple traits. In this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- If both C and B are present, the bird is Checkered Red (dominant for both).\n- If C is present but B is not, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present, regardless of each other, it's Plain Red or Plain Brown.\n\nBut in reality, since each trait is independent, the actual phenotypic ratio depends on the segregation of each gene. Let me use a Punnett square to map the results.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each).\n\nSo the Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n          Cb       |    cb\n        -------------------\n        CB      |  CcBb     |  CcBb\n        cb       |  ccbb     |  ccbb\n        -------------------\n        CcBb    |  CcBb     |  CcBb\n        ccbb    |  ccbb     |  ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be:\n\nEach parent contributes CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is present and B is present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (same as above)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (no C, no B)\n\nSo the counts per phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 individual (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 individuals (from Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0 individuals (since bb doesn't express brown)\nWait, no\u2014in the F2, the presence of B allows for brown coloration. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (two Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0 (since all have B present, except none)\n- Plain Red: 1 (cc bb)\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match what I got. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I'm missing something regarding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to consider the number of each genotype and then translate them to phenotypes. Since each gene acts independently, the number of each genotype can be determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus: each bird can have either C (present) or c (absent), each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: each bird can have either B (present) or b (absent), each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of any particular combination is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered Red (probability 1/4)\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Brown (probability 1/4)\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown (probability 1/4)\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain Red (probability 1/4)\n\nBut wait, in reality, the presence of B affects the color. So even if C is present, if B is absent, it's Checkered Brown; if C is absent, regardless of B, it's Plain Red. So the phenotypes are as I listed before.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio would be approximately 25% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Brown, 25% Plain Red. But none of the options exactly reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A-F: All have ratios adding up to 100%, but the numbers vary.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12.\n\nWait, none of the options add up to 16. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem states:\n\nRed is controlled by C, and checkered by c. Brown is controlled by B, and brown by b.\n\nSo, dominant alleles for color are R (C) and B (B). So, presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective color.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (_B), then it's Checkered Red.\n- If C is present (C_), but B is not (_b), then it's Checkered Brown.\n- If C is not present (c_), and B is present (_B), then it's Plain Brown.\n- If C is not present (c_), and B is not present (_b), then it's Plain Red.\n\nGiven this, the expected phenotypic ratios based on independent assortment would indeed be 25% each. But the options don't reflect this directly.\n\nLooking back at the user's options, the correct answer should have each phenotype represented equally, but given that the options don't perfectly align, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the sum of the squares of the coefficients equals 1. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the actual number of each genotype rather than phenotypes.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a Punnett square where each gene segregates independently. The F2 generation would involve the F1 being CcBb, which when crossed, would produce the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 x F1:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nWhen performing the Punnett square, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with a 25% chance.\n\nBut when squaring these for the Punnett square, each cell represents the combination of two gametes. However, to get the actual number of each genotype, we'd need to count the number of each possible combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios combine these. For example, the phenotype Checkered Red occurs when both C and B are present, which is 25% of the time. Similarly, Checkered Brown is when C is present but B is absent (25%), Plain Brown is when C is absent and B is present (25%), and Plain Red is when both are absent (25%). Thus, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16.\n\nThis suggests a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. This implies that one phenotype isn't expressed. Perhaps the presence of B overrides the effect of C. Wait, no\u2014if C is present, it overrides B. So if C is present, the bird is Checkered Red, regardless of B. Only when C is absent does the B status affect the color. So, if C is present, B doesn't matter. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by whether C is present or not, regardless of B.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C present \u2192 Checkered Red (regardless of B)\n- C absent \u2192 Plain Red (if B is present) or Plain Brown (if B is absent)\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is present, it overrides B, making it Checkered Red. If C is absent, then B determines the color: B present makes it Plain Brown, B absent makes it Plain Red.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- C present: Checkered Red\n- C absent and B present: Plain Brown\n- C absent and B absent: Plain Red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Red : (Plain Brown + Plain Red) = 1 : (1 + 1) = 1:2\n\nBut according to this, the phenotypic ratio would be 1 part Checkered Red, and 2 parts (1 Plain Brown and 1 Plain Red). However, none of the options reflect this exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nWait, the problem specifies that red is for C (dominant) and plain is recessive (c), while brown is B (dominant) and plain brown is recessive (b). So, the presence of either dominant allele determines the color. Therefore, the presence of C (even if B is not present) makes it Checkered Red. Presence of C and B makes it Checkered Brown. Absence of C and B makes it Plain Red. Absence of C and B with B present makes it Plain Brown. Absence of C and B with B absent makes it Plain Red.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (C present)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 (C and B present)\n- Plain Brown: 1 (C absent and B present)\n- Plain Red: 1 (C and B absent)\n\nWhich sums to 4 parts, with each phenotype having 25%.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum 16.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum 16.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum 12.\n\nHmm. Perhaps I need to reconsider the actual number of each genotype in F2. Let me try calculating the number of each genotype based on the F1's gametes.\n\nF1 is CcBb. So, it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1 (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 2 Cc Bb: (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 1 cc bb: (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, translating these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (C and B absent)\n- None are Plain Brown because B is present in all cases except when both C and B are absent.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, checkered is when C is present and c is recessive. So, if C is present (either as C or c), the bird is Checkered. Regardless of B, as long as C is present, it's Checkered. If C is absent, then:\n\n- If B is present, it's Plain Brown\n- If B is absent, it's Plain Red\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C present (any B)\n- Checkered Brown: C present and B absent\n- Plain Brown: C absent and B present\n- Plain Red: C absent and B absent\n\nSo, in terms of counts in F2:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (from Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0 (since all have B present unless C is absent)\n- Plain Red: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nBut that contradicts the previous understanding because in reality, if C is absent, B determines the color. So, in the F2, the presence of C dictates the color. So, if C is present, regardless of B, it's Checkered; if C is absent, then B decides the color. Therefore, in the F2:\n\n- All genotypes without C (cc bb and Cc Bb) will have B determining the phenotype. So:\n\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n  - cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n  - CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n  - Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (wait, no\u2014if C is present, regardless of B, it's Checkered. So CC BB is already covered.)\n\nWait, no. Because in the F2, the presence of C overrides B. So, any bird with at least one C allele will be Checkered. If they have no C alleles, then their phenotype depends on B: B present \u2192 Plain Brown, B absent \u2192 Plain Red.\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- Number of Checkered Red: All birds with at least one C allele. Let's calculate the number of each genotype and then see how many have C present.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc bb: C absent \u2192 Plain Red (since B is present)\n- Cc BB: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc bb: C absent \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach is confusing. Let me instead calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nProportions of each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, for each genotype, the phenotype is:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Red\n\nBecause if C is present (whether through CC or Cc), the bird is Checkered; if C is absent, then B determines the color. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75% (all with C present)\n- Checkered Brown: 25% (only Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0% (since all without C have B present)\n- Plain Red: 25% (all without C)\n\nBut that can't be right because in reality, the presence of B when C is absent would make it Plain Brown. So, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 3 : 1 : 0 : 1\n\nBut since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I'm still misunderstanding.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the presence of dominant alleles C or B will result in the respective color. So, if a bird has C or B, it's Checkered; if it has c and b, it's plain.\n\nWait, but checkered is dominant, so if either C or c is present, it's Checkered. But wait, no\u2014the problem states that red is dominant, so presence of C (dominant) would override the effect of c. Similarly, brown is dominant, so presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of b.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (Checkered) or not. Similarly, B determines if the color is brown or plain.\n\nSo, in F2, the presence of C dictates the color: If C is present, regardless of B, it's Checkered. If C is absent, then:\n\n- If B is present, it's Brown\n- If B is absent, it's Plain Red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since both C and B are present)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (only B present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (no C, but B present)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (both C and B present)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (no C, B present)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (no C, no B)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (no C, B present)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (no C, no B)\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that seems too many. Actually, for each gene, there are two possibilities, so the total phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C present, B absent\n- Checkered Brown: C present, B present\n- Plain Brown: C absent, B present\n- Plain Red: C absent, B absent\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category based on the Punnett square.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would have the following possibilities:\n\n- From the F1 (CcBb), each gamete is CB or cb.\nSo the F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach might be confusing. Instead, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 would have the following:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the probability is 25% for each outcome. But since we have two genes, the combined probability is 25% for each phenotype combination.\n\nHowever, some phenotypes may overlap if a phenotype is influenced by multiple traits. In this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- If both C and B are present, the bird is Checkered Red (dominant for both).\n- If C is present but B is not, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present, regardless of each other, it's Plain Red or Plain Brown.\n\nBut in reality, since each trait is independent, the actual phenotypic ratio depends on the segregation of each gene. Let me use a Punnett square to map the results.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each).\n\nSo the Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n          Cb       |    cb\n        -------------------\n        CB      |  CcBb     |  CcBb\n        cb       |  ccbb     |  ccbb\n        -------------------\n        CcBb    |  CcBb     |  CcBb\n        ccbb    |  ccbb     |  ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be:\n\nEach parent contributes CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is present and B is present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (same as above)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (no C, no B)\n\nSo the counts per phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 individual (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 individuals (from Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0 individuals (since bb doesn't express brown)\nWait, no\u2014in the F2, the presence of B allows for brown coloration. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (two Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0 (since all have B present, except none)\n- Plain Red: 1 (cc bb)\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match what I got. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I'm missing something regarding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to consider the number of each genotype and then translate them to phenotypes. Since each gene acts independently, the number of each genotype can be determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus: each bird can have either C (present) or c (absent), each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: each bird can have either B (present) or b (absent), each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of any particular combination is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered Red (probability 1/4)\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Brown (probability 1/4)\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown (probability 1/4)\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain Red (probability 1/4)\n\nBut wait, in reality, the presence of B affects the color. So even if C is present, if B is absent, it's Checkered Brown; if C is absent, regardless of B, it's Plain Red. So the phenotypes are as I listed before.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio would be approximately 25% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Brown, 25% Plain Red. But none of the options exactly reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A-F: All have ratios adding up to 100%, but the numbers vary.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12.\n\nWait, none of the options add up to 16. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem states:\n\nRed is controlled by C, and checkered by c. Brown is controlled by B, and brown by b.\n\nSo, dominant alleles for color are R (C) and B (B). So, presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective color.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (_B), then it's Checkered Red.\n- If C is present (C_), but B is not (_b), then it's Checkered Brown.\n- If C is not present (c_), and B is present (_B), then it's Plain Brown.\n- If C is not present (c_), and B is not present (_b), then it's Plain Red.\n\nGiven this, the expected phenotypic ratios based on independent assortment would indeed be 25% each. But the options don't reflect this directly.\n\nLooking back at the user's options, the correct answer should have each phenotype represented equally, but given that the options don't perfectly align, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the sum of the squares of the coefficients equals 1. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the actual number of each genotype rather than phenotypes.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a Punnett square where each gene segregates independently. The F2 generation would involve the F1 being CcBb, which when crossed, would produce the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 x F1:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nWhen performing the Punnett square, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with a 25% chance.\n\nBut when squaring these for the Punnett square, each cell represents the combination of two gametes. However, to get the actual number of each genotype, we'd need to count the number of each possible combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios combine these. For example, the phenotype Checkered Red occurs when both C and B are present, which is 25% of the time. Similarly, Checkered Brown is when C is present but B is absent (25%), Plain Brown is when C is absent and B is present (25%), and Plain Red is when both are absent (25%). Thus, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16.\n\nThis suggests a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. This implies that one phenotype isn't expressed. Perhaps the presence of B overrides the effect of C. Wait, no\u2014if C is present, it overrides B. So if C is present, the bird is Checkered Red, regardless of B. Only when C is absent does the B status affect the color. So, if C is present, B doesn't matter. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by whether C is present or not, regardless of B.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C present \u2192 Checkered Red (regardless of B)\n- C absent \u2192 Plain Red (if B is present) or Plain Brown (if B is absent)\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is present, it overrides B, making it Checkered Red. If C is absent, then B determines the color: B present makes it Plain Brown, B absent makes it Plain Red.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- C present: Checkered Red\n- C absent and B present: Plain Brown\n- C absent and B absent: Plain Red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Red : (Plain Brown + Plain Red) = 1 : (1 + 1) = 1:2\n\nBut according to this, the phenotypic ratio would be 1 part Checkered Red, and 2 parts (1 Plain Brown and 1 Plain Red). However, none of the options reflect this exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nWait, the problem specifies that red is for C (dominant) and plain is recessive (c), while brown is B (dominant) and plain brown is recessive (b). So, the presence of either dominant allele determines the color. Therefore, the presence of C (even if B is not present) makes it Checkered Red. Presence of C and B makes it Checkered Brown. Absence of C and B makes it Plain Red. Absence of C and B with B present makes it Plain Brown. Absence of C and B with B absent makes it Plain Red.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (C present)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 (C and B present)\n- Plain Brown: 1 (C absent and B present)\n- Plain Red: 1 (C and B absent)\n\nWhich sums to 4 parts, with each phenotype having 25%.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum 16.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum 16.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum 12.\n\nHmm. Perhaps I need to reconsider the actual number of each genotype in F2. Let me try calculating the number of each genotype based on the F1's gametes.\n\nF1 is CcBb. So, it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1 (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 2 Cc Bb: (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 1 cc bb: (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, translating these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (C and B absent)\n- None are Plain Brown because B is present in all cases except when both C and B are absent.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, checkered is when C is present and c is recessive. So, if C is present (either as C or c), the bird is Checkered. Regardless of B, as long as C is present, it's Checkered. If C is absent, then:\n\n- If B is present, it's Plain Brown\n- If B is absent, it's Plain Red\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C present (any B)\n- Checkered Brown: C present and B absent\n- Plain Brown: C absent and B present\n- Plain Red: C absent and B absent\n\nSo, in terms of counts in F2:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (from Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0 (since all have B present unless C is absent)\n- Plain Red: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nBut that contradicts the previous understanding because in reality, if C is absent, B determines the color. So, in the F2, the presence of C dictates the color. So, if C is present, regardless of B, it's Checkered; if C is absent, then B decides the color. Therefore, in the F2:\n\n- All genotypes without C (cc bb and Cc Bb) will have B determining the phenotype. So:\n\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n  - cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n  - CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n  - Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (wait, no\u2014if C is present, regardless of B, it's Checkered. So CC BB is already covered.)\n\nWait, no. Because in the F2, the presence of C overrides B. So, any bird with at least one C allele will be Checkered. If they have no C alleles, then their phenotype depends on B: B present \u2192 Plain Brown, B absent \u2192 Plain Red.\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- Number of Checkered Red: All birds with at least one C allele. Let's calculate the number of each genotype and then see how many have C present.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc bb: C absent \u2192 Plain Red (since B is present)\n- Cc BB: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc bb: C absent \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach is confusing. Let me instead calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nProportions of each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, for each genotype, the phenotype is:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Red\n\nBecause if C is present (whether through CC or Cc), the bird is Checkered; if C is absent, then B determines the color. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75% (all with C present)\n- Checkered Brown: 25% (only Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 0% (since all without C have B present)\n- Plain Red: 25% (all without C)\n\nBut that can't be right because in reality, the presence of B when C is absent would make it Plain Brown. So, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 3 : 1 : 0 : 1\n\nBut since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I'm still misunderstanding.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the presence of dominant alleles C or B will result in the respective color. So, if a bird has C or B, it's Checkered; if it has c and b, it's plain.\n\nWait, but checkered is dominant, so if either C or c is present, it's Checkered. But wait, no\u2014the problem states that red is dominant, so presence of C (dominant) would override the effect of c. Similarly, brown is dominant, so presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of b.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (Checkered) or not. Similarly, B determines if the color is brown or plain.\n\nSo, in F2, the presence of C dictates the color: If C is present, regardless of B, it's Checkered. If C is absent, then:\n\n- If B is present, it's Brown\n- If B is absent, it's Plain Red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two possible outcomes, leading to four phenotypes overall.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are two possible outcomes, leading to four phenotypes overall. However, some phenotypes may combine due to dominance. Wait, but in this case, the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So for example, if C is present, regardless of B, it's red. Similarly, if B is present, regardless of C, it's brown, etc.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n3. Plain Red (c present, B absent)\n4. Plain Brown (c present, B present)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Probability C is present (C): 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability B is present (B): 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- Probability C is absent (c): 1/4\n- Probability B is absent (b): 1/4\n\nThe phenotypes correspond to whether each gene is present or not. So:\n\n1. Checkered Red: c present (prob 1/4) AND B absent (prob 1/4) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n2. Checkered Brown: c present (1/4) AND B present (3/4) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n3. Plain Red: C present (3/4) AND B absent (1/4) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n4. Plain Brown: C present (3/4) AND B present (3/4) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nAdding them up: 1+3+3+9=16, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but the options given in the choices don't seem to match this directly. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 ratio in terms of phenotypes, considering the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the actual phenotypic expressions rather than just the count of genotypes. Let me think differently. In dihybrid crosses, especially when considering multiple traits, the phenotypic ratios can be complex. Let's try to map the F2 genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n7. cc BB (Plain Red)\n8. cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n9. cc bb (Checkered Red)\n\nBut wait, actually, each gene's presence affects the phenotype. So, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (dominant C and dominant B)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (same reason)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7,9 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 3,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Red: Case 7 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, the probabilities were different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recalculate the probabilities considering the actual genotypes.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present and 1/4 absent. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Red: (3/4)* (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered Brown: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Plain Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain Red: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWhich adds up to 16 parts. Now, converting these fractions into counts based on the total of 16 F2 individuals:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3/16 * 16 = 3\n- Checkered Brown: 9/16 *16=9\n- Plain Brown: 3/16*16=3\n- Plain Red: 1/16*16=1\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 3 : 9 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to option H: phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, 3+9+3+1=16, so each part is 16. The ratio is 3:9:3:1, which can also be simplified by dividing each by 3, giving 1:3:1:1/3, but perhaps it's better left as 3:9:3:1. Looking back at the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each providing specific numbers. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possible outcomes, leading to four phenotypes overall. However, some phenotypes may combine due to dominance. Wait, but in this case, the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So for example, if C is present, regardless of B, it's red. Similarly, if B is present, regardless of C, it's brown, etc.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n3. Plain Red (c present, B absent)\n4. Plain Brown (c present, B present)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Probability C is present (C): 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability B is present (B): 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- Probability C is absent (c): 1/4\n- Probability B is absent (b): 1/4\n\nThe phenotypes correspond to whether each gene is present or not. So:\n\n1. Checkered Red: c present (prob 1/4) AND B absent (prob 1/4) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n2. Checkered Brown: c present (1/4) AND B present (3/4) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n3. Plain Red: C present (3/4) AND B absent (1/4) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n4. Plain Brown: C present (3/4) AND B present (3/4) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nAdding them up: 1+3+3+9=16, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but the options given in the choices don't seem to match this directly. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 ratio in terms of phenotypes, considering the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the actual phenotypic expressions rather than just the count of genotypes. Let me think differently. In dihybrid crosses, especially when considering multiple traits, the phenotypic ratios can be complex. Let's try to map the F2 genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n7. cc BB (Plain Red)\n8. cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n9. cc bb (Checkered Red)\n\nBut wait, actually, each gene's presence affects the phenotype. So, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (dominant C and dominant B)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (same reason)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7,9 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 3,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Red: Case 7 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, the probabilities were different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recalculate the probabilities considering the actual genotypes.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present and 1/4 absent. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Red: (3/4)* (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered Brown: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Plain Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain Red: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWhich adds up to 16 parts. Now, converting these fractions into counts based on the total of 16 F2 individuals:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3/16 * 16 = 3\n- Checkered Brown: 9/16 *16=9\n- Plain Brown: 3/16*16=3\n- Plain Red: 1/16*16=1\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 3 : 9 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to option H: phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, 3+9+3+1=16, so each part is 16. The ratio is 3:9:3:1, which can also be simplified by dividing each by 3, giving 1:3:1:1/3, but perhaps it's better left as 3:9:3:1. Looking back at the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each providing specific numbers. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation: 3:9:3:1, which is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

So the phenotypic ratios would be calculated by considering all combinations:\n\nRed = (C present AND B present)\nPlain = (C present AND B absent)\nCheckered = (C absent AND B present)\nWhite = (C absent AND B absent)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nRed: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPlain: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nCheckered: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nWhite: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut the options given don't include white.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, another approach: if we consider the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotypes directly without relying solely on the Punnett square method, perhaps that's easier. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Checkered white (but the user didn't provide this option)\n4. CC bb: Checkered white\n5. Cc BB: Checkered red\n6. Cc Bb: Checkered brown\n7. Cc bb: Checkered white\n8. Cc bb: Checkered white\n9. cc BB: Plain red\n10. cc Bb: Plain brown\n11. cc bb: Plain white\n12. cc bb: Plain white\n\nWait, but according to the user's answer choices, some options mention 'white' phenotypes, like option H and I. So perhaps the white phenotype isn't considered here, or maybe the user intended to omit it. Alternatively, perhaps the user included all phenotypes, including white, even though the options don't reflect them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that white is not an option, so the focus is on red, brown, and checkered. If that's the case, let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo focusing on red, brown, and checkered:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when either C is present (so red) and B is present (so brown). From the above list, that's cases 1, 5, 6, 9. That's 4 genotypes.\n\n- Checkered brown: Occurs when C is present (red) and B is absent (white). Cases 2,7,10,11: 4 genotypes.\n\n- Plain red: Occurs when C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown). Case 3: 1 genotype.\n\n- Plain brown: Occurs when C is absent (plain) and B is absent (white). Case 4: 1 genotype.\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:1:1, which simplifies to 4:4:1:1, but looking at the options, there's no such ratio. Option A is 6:2:2:2, which doesn't fit our count. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't align either. Option E is 3:9:1:3, still no match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which suggests equal distribution across all phenotypes. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems too high for checkered red. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match. Option I is 7:5:1:3, also doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems closer but not exactly matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, 4x4=16).\n\nNumber of Checkered red: Cases where C is present (3/4) and B is present (3/4): 3*3=9, but wait, no\u2014it's 16 total, so 9 Checkered red? No, wait, 3 possibilities for C (present or not) and 3 for B. So 3*3=9, but the user's answer lists 12 for Checkered red, which doesn't make sense unless they're counting differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user includes all phenotypes, including white, making the total 16, with Checkered red being 12, but that doesn't align with our earlier calculation.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the user is considering that in the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently, leading to:\n\nFor C: 9 (C present) vs 7 (c present)\nFor B: 9 (B present) vs 7 (b present)\n\nSo the combined phenotypes would be:\n\nRed: (C present AND B present) \u2192 (9 * 9)/16 = 81/16? Wait, that's not right. Actually, the number of Checkered red is 9 (C present) * 9 (B present) = 81? No, that's overcounting. Wait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nEach gene contributes a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive). For the two genes, the overall ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16.\n\nSo the actual counts would be:\n\nCheckered red: 9\n\nCheckered brown: 3\n\nPlain red: 3\n\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWhich totals 16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options provided match this. Looking at the options, option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests more than 16 individuals, which isn't possible. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation, but the options don't include this exact pheno ratio. The closest is option G, but it's 12 instead of 9. Perhaps the user made an error in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user forgot to account for some phenotypes, such as white, but since the options don't include that, perhaps they're omitted.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio according to our analysis is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which might imply that only 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but that doesn't align with our calculations. \n\nWait, perhaps the user included only the non-white phenotypes, treating white as not appearing. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, ignoring the 1 for white. So the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but expressed as 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't have this. The closest is option G, which is 12:2:2:0, implying that 12 checkered red and 2 checkered brown, but that contradicts our previous count of 9:3:3:1.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Given that, but since I have to choose from the given options, none perfectly matches our analysis, except option G, which is 12:2:2:0, but that's inconsistent with our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user forgot that each gene contributes equally, leading to 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the analysis is that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't among the options, perhaps the correct choice is option G, but it doesn't fully align. Alternatively, perhaps the user included all phenotypes, but the numbers were miswritten.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nIf the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match, then perhaps the user intended to omit some phenotypes, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me re-examine the inheritance.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, and both loci are linked, but the user hasn't specified linkage, so I assume they're independent.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, excluding the homozygous recessive (which is white). So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches this ratio. But the options don't include this exactly; option C lists 9,3,3,1. Yes, that's correct. So despite the confusion, option C is the correct phenotypic ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming dominance, any allele provides the phenotype.\n\nSo for the C locus: 3/4 chance of having C (red) and 1/4 chance of c (plain).

Alternatively, perhaps the user included all phenotypes, including white, even though the options don't reflect them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that white is not an option, so the focus is on red, brown, and checkered. If that's the case, let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo focusing on red, brown, and checkered:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when either C is present (so red) and B is present (so brown). From the above list, that's cases 1, 5, 6, 9. That's 4 genotypes.\n\n- Checkered brown: Occurs when C is present (red) and B is absent (white). Cases 2,7,10,11: 4 genotypes.\n\n- Plain red: Occurs when C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown). Case 3: 1 genotype.\n\n- Plain brown: Occurs when C is absent (plain) and B is absent (white). Case 4: 1 genotype.\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:1:1, which simplifies to 4:4:1:1, but looking at the options, there's no such ratio. Option A is 6:2:2:2, which doesn't fit our count. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't align either. Option E is 3:9:1:3, still no match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which suggests equal distribution across all phenotypes. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems too high for checkered red. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match. Option I is 7:5:1:3, also doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems closer but not exactly matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, 4x4=16).\n\nNumber of Checkered red: Cases where C is present (3/4) and B is present (3/4): 3*3=9, but wait, no\u2014it's 16 total, so 9 Checkered red? No, wait, 3 possibilities for C (present or not) and 3 for B. So 3*3=9, but the user's answer lists 12 for Checkered red, which doesn't make sense unless they're counting differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user includes all phenotypes, including white, making the total 16, with Checkered red being 12, but that doesn't align with our earlier calculation.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the user is considering that in the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently, leading to:\n\nFor C: 9 (C present) vs 7 (c present)\nFor B: 9 (B present) vs 7 (b present)\n\nSo the combined phenotypes would be:\n\nRed: (C present AND B present) \u2192 (9 * 9)/16 = 81/16? Wait, that's not right. Actually, the number of Checkered red is 9 (C present) * 9 (B present) = 81? No, that's overcounting. Wait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nEach gene contributes a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive). For the two genes, the overall ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16.\n\nSo the actual counts would be:\n\nCheckered red: 9\n\nCheckered brown: 3\n\nPlain red: 3\n\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWhich totals 16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options provided match this. Looking at the options, option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests more than 16 individuals, which isn't possible. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation, but the options don't include this exact pheno ratio. The closest is option G, but it's 12 instead of 9. Perhaps the user made an error in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user forgot to account for some phenotypes, such as white, but since the options don't include that, perhaps they're omitted.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio according to our analysis is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which might imply that only 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but that doesn't align with our calculations. \n\nWait, perhaps the user included only the non-white phenotypes, treating white as not appearing. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, ignoring the 1 for white. So the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but expressed as 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't have this. The closest is option G, which is 12:2:2:0, implying that 12 checkered red and 2 checkered brown, but that contradicts our previous count of 9:3:3:1.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Given that, but since I have to choose from the given options, none perfectly matches our analysis, except option G, which is 12:2:2:0, but that's inconsistent with our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user forgot that each gene contributes equally, leading to 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the analysis is that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't among the options, perhaps the correct choice is option G, but it doesn't fully align. Alternatively, perhaps the user included all phenotypes, but the numbers were miswritten.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nIf the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match, then perhaps the user intended to omit some phenotypes, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me re-examine the inheritance.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, and both loci are linked, but the user hasn't specified linkage, so I assume they're independent.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, excluding the homozygous recessive (which is white). So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches this ratio. But the options don't include this exactly; option C lists 9,3,3,1. Yes, that's correct. So despite the confusion, option C is the correct phenotypic ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since both genes are being considered, the total number of phenotypic classes is 3 x 3 = 9.",
    "rollout": " Since both genes are being considered, the total number of phenotypic classes is 3 x 3 = 9. But some phenotypes might be overlapping if the dominance relationships cause certain combinations to look the same. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n4. Both recessive: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So the presence of C and/or B determines the phenotype.\n\nSo the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it's Checkered red.\n- If it has a dominant C but not a dominant B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If it doesn't have a dominant C but has a dominant B, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is dominant, it's Plain brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype in the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (C): 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of having a recessive allele (c): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (B): 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of having a recessive allele (b): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. Now, let's map the phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n4. Neither dominant: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 no, that doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, closer, but our ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Close but not matching.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, my earlier conclusion was 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly match. Let me double-check.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to different phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the actual phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has C and B alleles. So, any bird that has either C or B (or both) will express the corresponding phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- If both C and B are present: Checkered red\n- If C is present but B is absent: Checkered brown\n- If B is present but C is absent: Plain red\n- If neither is present: Plain brown\n\nGiven that, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- B present, C absent: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum=16, but 6+2+6+2=16. Ratio would be 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That's not matching 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,8,4 \u2192 Sum=24. Ratios 8:4:8:4 \u2192 2:1:2:1. Doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum=16. Yes! This matches our earlier calculation. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 no, that's not it.\n\nOption H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2192 All equal, which doesn't apply here.\n\nOption E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match 9:3:3:1. Did I make a miscalculation?\n\nLet me re-examine. The F2 generation is from a dihybrid cross where each parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the selfing of CcBb. In such a case, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, as each gene segregates independently. However, looking at the options, none provide this exact ratio except for option G, which lists 9,3,3,1 but with different numbers. Let me check the options again:\n\nThe user provided several options, including:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16, ratio 3:1:3:1\n\nB. 8,4,8,4 \u2192 2:1:2:1\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16, ratio 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 3:1:9:3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Simplified to 6:1:1:0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum=12, ratio 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\n\nLooking through, option C seems to have the correct ratios if scaled appropriately. Option C is: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 16. But according to our calculation, it's 9:3:3:1. Option G is also 16 but with higher numbers. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the phenotypes are counted. Maybe the user considers \"plain\" as the recessive state for both genes, leading to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype categories are ordered differently, such as dominant colors taking precedence over recessives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes beyond simple presence of alleles. For example, maybe a bird with at least one dominant allele for both genes is considered checkered red, while those without are plain. But that's what I've already considered.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the checkered color is only expressed when both genes are dominant, whereas brown and plain are expressed otherwise. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene would determine the phenotype. Therefore, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n4. Neither dominant: Plain brown\n\nWhich aligns with the initial analysis. Thus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this unless I misread something. Looking again at option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That sums to 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0. That suggests that plain red and plain brown are rare, which contradicts the fact that checkered red and brown should be common. Similarly, option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 and matches our ratio.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G if it were written as 9:3:3:1. But looking back, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't add up to 16. Let me recalculate the sum for option G: 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16. But the ratio given is 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. So perhaps option G is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me approach it differently. Let's count the number of possible phenotypes and see if any combine into the same phenotype. If the presence of C and B alleles leads to specific expressions, then:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B, it's Checkered red.\n- If it has a dominant C but not B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If it has a dominant B but not C, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is dominant, it's Plain brown.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected counts for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out. So the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But among the options, none match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 16, and the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is correct. So option C is the correct answer despite the phrasing in the options. However, looking back, the user listed option G as 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but represents a different ratio. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is represented in option C. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Since both genes are being considered, the total number of phenotypic classes is 3 x 3 = 9. But some phenotypes might be overlapping if the dominance relationships cause certain combinations to look the same. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n4. Both recessive: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So the presence of C and/or B determines the phenotype.\n\nSo the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it's Checkered red.\n- If it has a dominant C but not a dominant B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If it doesn't have a dominant C but has a dominant B, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is dominant, it's Plain brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype in the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (C): 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of having a recessive allele (c): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (B): 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of having a recessive allele (b): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. Now, let's map the phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n4. Neither dominant: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 no, that doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, closer, but our ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Close but not matching.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, my earlier conclusion was 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly match. Let me double-check.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to different phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the actual phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has C and B alleles. So, any bird that has either C or B (or both) will express the corresponding phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- If both C and B are present: Checkered red\n- If C is present but B is absent: Checkered brown\n- If B is present but C is absent: Plain red\n- If neither is present: Plain brown\n\nGiven that, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- B present, C absent: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum=16, but 6+2+6+2=16. Ratio would be 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That's not matching 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,8,4 \u2192 Sum=24. Ratios 8:4:8:4 \u2192 2:1:2:1. Doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum=16. Yes! This matches our earlier calculation. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 no, that's not it.\n\nOption H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2192 All equal, which doesn't apply here.\n\nOption E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match 9:3:3:1. Did I make a miscalculation?\n\nLet me re-examine. The F2 generation is from a dihybrid cross where each parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the selfing of CcBb. In such a case, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, as each gene segregates independently. However, looking at the options, none provide this exact ratio except for option G, which lists 9,3,3,1 but with different numbers. Let me check the options again:\n\nThe user provided several options, including:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16, ratio 3:1:3:1\n\nB. 8,4,8,4 \u2192 2:1:2:1\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16, ratio 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 3:1:9:3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Simplified to 6:1:1:0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum=16, ratio 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum=12, ratio 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\n\nLooking through, option C seems to have the correct ratios if scaled appropriately. Option C is: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 16. But according to our calculation, it's 9:3:3:1. Option G is also 16 but with higher numbers. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the phenotypes are counted. Maybe the user considers \"plain\" as the recessive state for both genes, leading to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype categories are ordered differently, such as dominant colors taking precedence over recessives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes beyond simple presence of alleles. For example, maybe a bird with at least one dominant allele for both genes is considered checkered red, while those without are plain. But that's what I've already considered.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the checkered color is only expressed when both genes are dominant, whereas brown and plain are expressed otherwise. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene would determine the phenotype. Therefore, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n4. Neither dominant: Plain brown\n\nWhich aligns with the initial analysis. Thus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this unless I misread something. Looking again at option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That sums to 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0. That suggests that plain red and plain brown are rare, which contradicts the fact that checkered red and brown should be common. Similarly, option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 and matches our ratio.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G if it were written as 9:3:3:1. But looking back, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't add up to 16. Let me recalculate the sum for option G: 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16. But the ratio given is 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. So perhaps option G is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me approach it differently. Let's count the number of possible phenotypes and see if any combine into the same phenotype. If the presence of C and B alleles leads to specific expressions, then:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B, it's Checkered red.\n- If it has a dominant C but not B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If it has a dominant B but not C, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is dominant, it's Plain brown.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected counts for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out. So the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But among the options, none match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 16, and the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is correct. So option C is the correct answer despite the phrasing in the options. However, looking back, the user listed option G as 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but represents a different ratio. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is represented in option C. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

    "rollout": " So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories. However, some phenotypes might overlap if the presence of one affects the others. In this case, since each gene acts independently, there are four phenotypic categories. Now, let's calculate how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nEach gene has two possibilities, so for each gene:\n\n- C: present (red) or absent (plain)\n\n- B: present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C present and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, each outcome (for each gene) has a 25% chance. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability isn't simply multiplied unless they are linked. Assuming they are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nBut actually, each individual has a 25% chance for each phenotype combination. However, when considering dominance, some phenotypes may combine. For example, in the C locus, even though C is dominant over c, if an individual has at least one C, they'll display red pigment regardless of whether they have c or not. Similarly, for B, having at least one B leads to brown.\n\nWait, but the question is about phenotypic ratios based on the presence of dominant alleles. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would reflect the number of individuals who have each combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nGiven that each gene has two possibilities, the total number of phenotypic categories is four. Now, let's determine how many individuals in the F2 generation will exhibit each phenotype.\n\nAssuming complete dominance (which is implied by the notation where uppercase letters represent dominant traits and lowercase recessive), then:\n\n- For the C locus: Any presence of C results in red pigment.\n- For the B locus: Any presence of B results in brown color.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, each individual's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThe possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nFor the C locus: The probability of having at least one C (i.e., displaying red) is 3/4 (since only 1/4 have both c and c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: Probability of having at least one B (i.e., displaying brown) is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the probability of both occurring together is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, this is not exactly accurate because the actual calculation considers the number of phenotypic categories, not the probabilities directly.\n\nLet me approach this differently by counting the number of individuals in each phenotype category. Given that F2 is a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio without considering dominance is 9:3:3:1. But since the question specifies dominance (i.e., the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype), the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, in the context of dominance, the phenotypes would still follow the same ratio because each dominant allele contributes to the phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, when considering dominance, the ratio doesn't change beyond the basic 9:3:3:1, except that certain categories may combine. However, the question seems to imply that each phenotype is defined by the presence of dominant alleles, so the ratio should remain 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none of them list a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, all the options list different ratios, including those like 6:2:6:2, which suggests that only two phenotypes are considered, perhaps ignoring the recessive phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio under the assumption of dominance, treating each dominant trait as fully expressed, thus combining some categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the answer options, and the intended correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but given the options provided, option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, but that's 9:3:3:1, which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option D's description says 1,3,9,3, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that's 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, but perhaps the user is listing the counts in reverse order. Alternatively, the user might have mislabeled the options, but according to the analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option D if the counts are inverted.\n\nBut another possibility is that the user is considering the phenotypes without considering dominance, i.e., treating each allele separately, resulting in 3:3:3:3, but that's not among the options either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is only considering the presence of the dominant alleles, effectively grouping the recessive phenotypes into a single category. If so, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the answer choices. Because according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D if the counts are inverted. But without knowing the exact definition, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the counts in a particular order, such as checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, which would be 1:3:9:3. Looking at option D, that's exactly what it says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So despite the ordering, it matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when reversed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic categories.

However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability isn't simply multiplied unless they are linked. Assuming they are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nBut actually, each individual has a 25% chance for each phenotype combination. However, when considering dominance, some phenotypes may combine. For example, in the C locus, even though C is dominant over c, if an individual has at least one C, they'll display red pigment regardless of whether they have c or not. Similarly, for B, having at least one B leads to brown.\n\nWait, but the question is about phenotypic ratios based on the presence of dominant alleles. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would reflect the number of individuals who have each combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nGiven that each gene has two possibilities, the total number of phenotypic categories is four. Now, let's determine how many individuals in the F2 generation will exhibit each phenotype.\n\nAssuming complete dominance (which is implied by the notation where uppercase letters represent dominant traits and lowercase recessive), then:\n\n- For the C locus: Any presence of C results in red pigment.\n- For the B locus: Any presence of B results in brown color.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, each individual's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThe possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nFor the C locus: The probability of having at least one C (i.e., displaying red) is 3/4 (since only 1/4 have both c and c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: Probability of having at least one B (i.e., displaying brown) is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the probability of both occurring together is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, this is not exactly accurate because the actual calculation considers the number of phenotypic categories, not the probabilities directly.\n\nLet me approach this differently by counting the number of individuals in each phenotype category. Given that F2 is a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio without considering dominance is 9:3:3:1. But since the question specifies dominance (i.e., the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype), the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, in the context of dominance, the phenotypes would still follow the same ratio because each dominant allele contributes to the phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, when considering dominance, the ratio doesn't change beyond the basic 9:3:3:1, except that certain categories may combine. However, the question seems to imply that each phenotype is defined by the presence of dominant alleles, so the ratio should remain 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none of them list a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, all the options list different ratios, including those like 6:2:6:2, which suggests that only two phenotypes are considered, perhaps ignoring the recessive phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio under the assumption of dominance, treating each dominant trait as fully expressed, thus combining some categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the answer options, and the intended correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but given the options provided, option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, but that's 9:3:3:1, which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option D's description says 1,3,9,3, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that's 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, but perhaps the user is listing the counts in reverse order. Alternatively, the user might have mislabeled the options, but according to the analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option D if the counts are inverted.\n\nBut another possibility is that the user is considering the phenotypes without considering dominance, i.e., treating each allele separately, resulting in 3:3:3:3, but that's not among the options either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is only considering the presence of the dominant alleles, effectively grouping the recessive phenotypes into a single category. If so, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the answer choices. Because according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D if the counts are inverted. But without knowing the exact definition, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the counts in a particular order, such as checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, which would be 1:3:9:3. Looking at option D, that's exactly what it says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So despite the ordering, it matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when reversed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there's a 2/3 chance of the dominant trait and 1/3 chance of the recessive.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there's a 2/3 chance of the dominant trait and 1/3 chance of the recessive. Since the traits are independent, the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant:\n   - Pigmented (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n2. C dominant, B recessive:\n   - Pigmented (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n\n3. C recessive, B dominant:\n   -Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n4. Both recessive:\n   -Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant and 1/3 of recessive. Assuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered Red: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Plain Red: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Checkered Brown: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain Brown: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding them up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are approximately:\n\n- Checkered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown \u2248 4 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide specific ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question is asking for the F2 ratio without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual genotypes rather than just the phenotypes, but the options don't match my calculation. Let me re-examine the parents and the cross.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Wait, but if the parents are homozygous, then all their offspring should be the same. That can't be right. Oh! Wait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So CC BB is homozygous for both C and B. Similarly, cc bb is homozygous for both c and b.\n\nTherefore, when crossed, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. As before, the F2 would have four genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb, each at 25% frequency. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n   - Dominant (C): Checkered Red (since C is dominant over c)\n   - Recessive (c): Plain Red\n\n- For color (B):\n   - Dominant (B): Brown\n   - Recessive (b): Checkered\n\nSince both traits are independent, the phenotype is a combination. So:\n\n1. C dominant (C): Pigmented (Red) \u2192 B dominant (B): Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant (C): Pigmented (Red) \u2192 B recessive (b): Checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n3. C recessive (c): Plain \u2192 B dominant (B): Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. C recessive (c): Plain \u2192 B recessive (b): Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant and 1/3 recessive. Assuming independence, the probabilities are:\n\nCheckered Red: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nPlain Red: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nCheckered Brown: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nPlain Brown: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nThese add up to 100%, which is correct. So the phenotypic ratio is roughly 4:2:2:1. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:0:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nLooking for the closest match, option D is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't align with our 4:2:2:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems off. Option E is 3:9:1:3, also not matching. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which is similar to the 4:2:2:1 if scaled up by a factor of 3. If we scale our 4:2:2:1 by 3, we get 12:6:6:3, which isn't exactly any option. Perhaps the user intended the ratio without simplifying, so 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me verify:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- C: Checkered Red (dominant)\n- c: Plain Red (recessive)\n\nColor (B):\n\n- B: Brown (dominant)\n- b: Checkered (recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered Red (4/9)\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain Red (2/9)\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown (2/9)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain Brown (1/9)\n\nThis gives the ratio 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options, option J says 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:0:4, which sums to 12 parts, but that's not consistent either. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't match. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, nope. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which could correspond to a different scenario where the dominance ratios are different, such as B having a 3:1 ratio instead of 2:1. But according to the problem statement, B is dominant over b, so each should have a 2:1 ratio, leading to 4:2:2:1.\n\nHmm, maybe the user intended the F2 ratio without considering dominance, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the cross setup. Let me reconsider the cross itself: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb because the parents are homozygous. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The Punnett square would indeed result in four genotypes: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. So the F2 phenotypes would follow the 4:2:2:1 ratio as previously established.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. However, option D is 1:3:9:3, which might suggest a different approach, possibly considering each gene separately without considering their combined effect. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 ratio without accounting for dominance, treating each trait as completely dominant or recessive. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All C (C dominant) and B (B dominant): Checkered Red (100%)\n\n- C dominant, B recessive: Plain Red (0%)\n\n- C recessive, B dominant: Checkered Brown (100%)\n\n- C recessive, B recessive: Plain Brown (0%)\n\nBut that would make the ratio 1:0:1:0, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, if each gene contributes equally, the phenotypic ratio would be different. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another angle. Maybe the problem is expecting the F2 ratio after considering the actual number of individuals, including those who die due to death of parents or other factors, but the user didn't mention anything about that. Also, the F2 generation refers to the ratio, not the number of surviving individuals. So focusing solely on the genetic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Given the options, none seem to fit perfectly, but option J is 2:6:3:1, which could represent a different calculation, maybe considering the dominance differently. Wait, if we assume that only one allele is contributing, say, pigment, then:\n\n- C dominant: 2/3\n- c recessive: 1/3\n\nSimilarly for color, B dominant: 2/3, b recessive: 1/3.\n\nIf we were to ignore the other gene and only consider pigment, then:\n\n- Pigmented: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n- Plain: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n\nAnd similarly for color, ignoring the other gene:\n\n- Brown: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n- Checkered: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n\nThen, the combined phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Brown (4/9 * 4/9?) No, that's mixing things up. Alternatively, if we consider each gene's contribution separately, the phenotypic ratio would still be 4:2:2:1.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to ask for the F2 ratio considering only one gene, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 ratio, but the user specifically said F2.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 4:2:2:1, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking back, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nTotal genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant, B dominant): Checkered Red\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, B recessive): Plain Red\n- 25% cc (c dominant, B dominant): Checkered Brown\n- 25% bb (c dominant, B recessive): Plain Brown\n\nThus, Checkered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown = 1 : 1 : 1 : 1, but weighted by their probabilities.\n\nWait, no, the weights are based on the probabilities of each genotype. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n- Plain Red: (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9\n- Checkered Brown: (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Brown: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nWhich adds up to 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Still, none of the options match this. Looking back at the options, option J is 2:6:3:1, which is 2:6:3:1. Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio as 4:2:2:1, which can also be written as 12:6:6:3 if multiplied by 3, making it 12:6:6:3, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to include the F1 ratio, which is 2:2:2:2, but that's not the case.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the options, none seem to fit exactly, but option D is 1:3:9:3, which might represent a different scenario, perhaps where each trait is considered independently without considering dominance. For example, if each trait had a 3:1 ratio, then the combined ratio would be 1*1=1, 1*3=3, 3*1=3, 3*3=9, totaling 1+3+3+9=16, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F2 ratio without considering dominance, leading to 1:3:9:3, which would correspond to option D. However, according to the problem statement, dominance applies, so the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the cross or the phenotypes. Another possibility: perhaps the question is about the F1 ratio, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the actual number of possible offspring, disregarding dominance, treating each allele as fully expressed. That would mean:\n\n- C dominant: 25% \u2192 Checkered Red (if both C alleles are present)\n- C recessive: 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- Similarly for B:\n\n- B dominant: 25% \u2192 Brown\n- B recessive: 25% \u2192 Checkered\n\nBut since each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n(2/3 * 2/3) : (1/3 * 2/3) : (2/3 * 1/3) : (1/3 * 1/3) = 4:2:2:1.\n\nAgain, this leads to the same conclusion. Given that, I think none of the options match, but option D is 1:3:9:3, which might be a distractor. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F2 ratio without considering dominance, leading to 1:3:9:3, corresponding to option D. Considering the confusion, I'll go with option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there's a 2/3 chance of the dominant trait and 1/3 chance of the recessive. Since the traits are independent, the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant:\n   - Pigmented (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n2. C dominant, B recessive:\n   - Pigmented (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n\n3. C recessive, B dominant:\n   -Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n4. Both recessive:\n   -Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant and 1/3 of recessive. Assuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered Red: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Plain Red: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Checkered Brown: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain Brown: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding them up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are approximately:\n\n- Checkered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown \u2248 4 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide specific ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question is asking for the F2 ratio without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual genotypes rather than just the phenotypes, but the options don't match my calculation. Let me re-examine the parents and the cross.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Wait, but if the parents are homozygous, then all their offspring should be the same. That can't be right. Oh! Wait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So CC BB is homozygous for both C and B. Similarly, cc bb is homozygous for both c and b.\n\nTherefore, when crossed, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. As before, the F2 would have four genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb, each at 25% frequency. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n   - Dominant (C): Checkered Red (since C is dominant over c)\n   - Recessive (c): Plain Red\n\n- For color (B):\n   - Dominant (B): Brown\n   - Recessive (b): Checkered\n\nSince both traits are independent, the phenotype is a combination. So:\n\n1. C dominant (C): Pigmented (Red) \u2192 B dominant (B): Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant (C): Pigmented (Red) \u2192 B recessive (b): Checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n3. C recessive (c): Plain \u2192 B dominant (B): Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. C recessive (c): Plain \u2192 B recessive (b): Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant and 1/3 recessive. Assuming independence, the probabilities are:\n\nCheckered Red: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nPlain Red: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nCheckered Brown: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nPlain Brown: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nThese add up to 100%, which is correct. So the phenotypic ratio is roughly 4:2:2:1. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:0:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nLooking for the closest match, option D is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't align with our 4:2:2:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems off. Option E is 3:9:1:3, also not matching. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which is similar to the 4:2:2:1 if scaled up by a factor of 3. If we scale our 4:2:2:1 by 3, we get 12:6:6:3, which isn't exactly any option. Perhaps the user intended the ratio without simplifying, so 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me verify:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- C: Checkered Red (dominant)\n- c: Plain Red (recessive)\n\nColor (B):\n\n- B: Brown (dominant)\n- b: Checkered (recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered Red (4/9)\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain Red (2/9)\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown (2/9)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain Brown (1/9)\n\nThis gives the ratio 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options, option J says 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:0:4, which sums to 12 parts, but that's not consistent either. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't match. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, nope. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which could correspond to a different scenario where the dominance ratios are different, such as B having a 3:1 ratio instead of 2:1. But according to the problem statement, B is dominant over b, so each should have a 2:1 ratio, leading to 4:2:2:1.\n\nHmm, maybe the user intended the F2 ratio without considering dominance, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the cross setup. Let me reconsider the cross itself: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb because the parents are homozygous. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The Punnett square would indeed result in four genotypes: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. So the F2 phenotypes would follow the 4:2:2:1 ratio as previously established.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. However, option D is 1:3:9:3, which might suggest a different approach, possibly considering each gene separately without considering their combined effect. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 ratio without accounting for dominance, treating each trait as completely dominant or recessive. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All C (C dominant) and B (B dominant): Checkered Red (100%)\n\n- C dominant, B recessive: Plain Red (0%)\n\n- C recessive, B dominant: Checkered Brown (100%)\n\n- C recessive, B recessive: Plain Brown (0%)\n\nBut that would make the ratio 1:0:1:0, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, if each gene contributes equally, the phenotypic ratio would be different. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another angle. Maybe the problem is expecting the F2 ratio after considering the actual number of individuals, including those who die due to death of parents or other factors, but the user didn't mention anything about that. Also, the F2 generation refers to the ratio, not the number of surviving individuals. So focusing solely on the genetic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Given the options, none seem to fit perfectly, but option J is 2:6:3:1, which could represent a different calculation, maybe considering the dominance differently. Wait, if we assume that only one allele is contributing, say, pigment, then:\n\n- C dominant: 2/3\n- c recessive: 1/3\n\nSimilarly for color, B dominant: 2/3, b recessive: 1/3.\n\nIf we were to ignore the other gene and only consider pigment, then:\n\n- Pigmented: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n- Plain: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n\nAnd similarly for color, ignoring the other gene:\n\n- Brown: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n- Checkered: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n\nThen, the combined phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Brown (4/9 * 4/9?) No, that's mixing things up. Alternatively, if we consider each gene's contribution separately, the phenotypic ratio would still be 4:2:2:1.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to ask for the F2 ratio considering only one gene, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 ratio, but the user specifically said F2.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 4:2:2:1, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking back, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nTotal genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant, B dominant): Checkered Red\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, B recessive): Plain Red\n- 25% cc (c dominant, B dominant): Checkered Brown\n- 25% bb (c dominant, B recessive): Plain Brown\n\nThus, Checkered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown = 1 : 1 : 1 : 1, but weighted by their probabilities.\n\nWait, no, the weights are based on the probabilities of each genotype. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: (2/3)^2 = 4/9\n- Plain Red: (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9\n- Checkered Brown: (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9\n- Plain Brown: (1/3)^2 = 1/9\n\nWhich adds up to 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Still, none of the options match this. Looking back at the options, option J is 2:6:3:1, which is 2:6:3:1. Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio as 4:2:2:1, which can also be written as 12:6:6:3 if multiplied by 3, making it 12:6:6:3, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to include the F1 ratio, which is 2:2:2:2, but that's not the case.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the options, none seem to fit exactly, but option D is 1:3:9:3, which might represent a different scenario, perhaps where each trait is considered independently without considering dominance. For example, if each trait had a 3:1 ratio, then the combined ratio would be 1*1=1, 1*3=3, 3*1=3, 3*3=9, totaling 1+3+3+9=16, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F2 ratio without considering dominance, leading to 1:3:9:3, which would correspond to option D. However, according to the problem statement, dominance applies, so the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the cross or the phenotypes. Another possibility: perhaps the question is about the F1 ratio, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the actual number of possible offspring, disregarding dominance, treating each allele as fully expressed. That would mean:\n\n- C dominant: 25% \u2192 Checkered Red (if both C alleles are present)\n- C recessive: 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- Similarly for B:\n\n- B dominant: 25% \u2192 Brown\n- B recessive: 25% \u2192 Checkered\n\nBut since each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n(2/3 * 2/3) : (1/3 * 2/3) : (2/3 * 1/3) : (1/3 * 1/3) = 4:2:2:1.\n\nAgain, this leads to the same conclusion. Given that, I think none of the options match, but option D is 1:3:9:3, which might be a distractor. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F2 ratio without considering dominance, leading to 1:3:9:3, corresponding to option D. Considering the confusion, I'll go with option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "The possible phenotypes are combinations of these.",
    "rollout": " \n\nThe possible phenotypes are combinations of these. The total number of phenotypic categories is 2x2=4. Now, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for the presence of the dominant allele. Wait, no\u2014each gene has a 3:1 ratio if considering dominance, but since we're dealing with actual counts, each gene contributes a certain number of individuals. But since we're looking at the combined effect, we'll use the multiplication principle.\n\nFor example, the probability of having the C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown): 9/16 \u2192 checkered red\n- C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 plain red\n- C recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 checkered brown\n- C recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that seems off. Because when calculating the phenotypic ratios, we need to consider the actual number of each phenotype. Let's count them properly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of possible combinations. Assuming each gene behaves independently, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all possible combinations. \n\nBut another approach is to realize that each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but since we're combining both genes, the overall ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, which sums up to 16 parts. However, depending on whether the genes are linked or independent, this might change. But since the problem states that the genes are controlled by different loci and presumably assort independently, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nLet me double-check this. The possible combinations for each gene are:\n\n- C (dominant): 25% (red)\n- C (recessive): 25% (plain)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- B (dominant): 25% (brown)\n- B (recessive): 25% (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is determined by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For each phenotype, we combine the probabilities of the respective alleles being dominant or recessive.\n\nThus:\n\n1. Both C dominant and B dominant: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant and B recessive: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Red\n3. C recessive and B dominant: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Both C recessive and B recessive: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding these together: 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 25%, which makes sense because there are four phenotypes. However, since the options given don't include percentages, perhaps the answer expects a ratio expressed as whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each gene has a 3:1 ratio when counting the possible genotypes, but for phenotypes, each combination leads to specific phenotypes. Let's approach it differently.\n\nEach gene can be considered separately. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C (dominant) : 3\n- c (recessive) : 1\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B (dominant) : 3\n- b (recessive) : 1\n\nSince these are independent, the total number of phenotypes is 3*3=9 possible combinations. However, some combinations may lead to the same phenotype due to the way the genes interact. Wait, but since both genes are acting independently, each combination will result in a distinct phenotype. So, for each of the four phenotypes, how many combinations correspond to them?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment color (C):\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for color (B):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 generation combines these:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB: All red, brown\n- CC \u00d7 Bb: All red, brown\n- CC \u00d7 bb: All plain, checkered\n- Cc \u00d7 BB: All red, brown\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb: All red, brown\n- Cc \u00d7 bb: All plain, checkered\n- cc \u00d7 BB: All plain, brown\n- cc \u00d7 Bb: All plain, brown\n- cc \u00d7 bb: All checkered, plain\n\nWait, but that's too granular. Instead, let's look at the phenotypes directly:\n\n- Checkered Red: Occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb)\n- Checkered Brown: C recessive (cc) and B dominant (BB or Bb)\n- Plain Red: C dominant (CC or Cc) and B recessive (bb)\n- Plain Brown: C dominant (CC or Cc) and B dominant (BB or Bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent is heterozygous (CcBb), the F1 is also CcBb, and the F2 comes from crossing CcBb x CcBb.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for CcBb x CcBb:\n\n- For C locus:\n  - CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\n- For B locus:\n  - BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach combination is equally likely. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cc (25%) * bb (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown: cc (25%) * (3/4 B dominant) = 18.75%?\nWait, no. Actually, for the B locus, B dominant is 3/4 and recessive is 1/4. But since the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is multiplied.\n\nWait, better yet, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal possible combinations: 4 (genotypes) x 4 (genotypes) = 16 possible offspring.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cc (25%) * bb (25%) = 6.25%\nBut in terms of proportion, since each gene is 3:1, the combined proportion is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16, so 6.25%.\n\n2. Checkered Brown: cc (25%) * (B dominant + B recessive) = 25% * 3/4 = 75% of checkered, but as a fraction, it's 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16, which is 18.75%.\nWait, no. Because the phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So, for each gene, the presence of dominant allele is 3/4, but the phenotype is based on the combination of both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the number of each combination.\n\nTotal offspring: 16 (since 4x4).\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (cc and bb):\n- 1 (cc) * 1 (bb) = 1\n- So 1/16, which is 6.25%\n\nCheckered Brown (cc and B dominant or recessive):\n- 1 (cc) * 3 (BB and Bb) = 3\n- 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n\nPlain Red (CC or Cc and bb):\n- 3 (CC and Cc) * 1 (bb) = 3\n- 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n\nPlain Brown (CC or Cc and B dominant):\n- 3 (CC and Cc) * 3 (BB and Bb) = 9\n- 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the previous approach where the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no. If each gene is 3:1, then the combined ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. Let me see:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C dominant, B recessive: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Red\n- C recessive, B dominant: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Both recessive: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding these: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nExpressed as a ratio: 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Checkered Red:Checkered Brown:Plain Red:Plain Brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 This is 9:3:3:1 scaled down, but the sum is 12, which doesn't match 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the ratio isn't matching.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This adds up to 16, and matches 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, sum is 16, but the ratio is reversed.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This adds up to 16, but the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1, which doesn't match the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the ratio is skewed.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 16, but ratio is 5:3:2:6.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but ratio is 7:5:1:3.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which doesn't add up.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio except Option C, which lists 9,3,3,1. So, Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which fits exactly.\n\nWait, but looking back, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, in my earlier calculation, I got 9:3:3:1, but the question provides option C as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nThe possible phenotypes are combinations of these. The total number of phenotypic categories is 2x2=4. Now, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for the presence of the dominant allele. Wait, no\u2014each gene has a 3:1 ratio if considering dominance, but since we're dealing with actual counts, each gene contributes a certain number of individuals. But since we're looking at the combined effect, we'll use the multiplication principle.\n\nFor example, the probability of having the C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown): 9/16 \u2192 checkered red\n- C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 plain red\n- C recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 checkered brown\n- C recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that seems off. Because when calculating the phenotypic ratios, we need to consider the actual number of each phenotype. Let's count them properly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of possible combinations. Assuming each gene behaves independently, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all possible combinations. \n\nBut another approach is to realize that each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but since we're combining both genes, the overall ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, which sums up to 16 parts. However, depending on whether the genes are linked or independent, this might change. But since the problem states that the genes are controlled by different loci and presumably assort independently, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nLet me double-check this. The possible combinations for each gene are:\n\n- C (dominant): 25% (red)\n- C (recessive): 25% (plain)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- B (dominant): 25% (brown)\n- B (recessive): 25% (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is determined by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For each phenotype, we combine the probabilities of the respective alleles being dominant or recessive.\n\nThus:\n\n1. Both C dominant and B dominant: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant and B recessive: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Red\n3. C recessive and B dominant: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Both C recessive and B recessive: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding these together: 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 25%, which makes sense because there are four phenotypes. However, since the options given don't include percentages, perhaps the answer expects a ratio expressed as whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each gene has a 3:1 ratio when counting the possible genotypes, but for phenotypes, each combination leads to specific phenotypes. Let's approach it differently.\n\nEach gene can be considered separately. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C (dominant) : 3\n- c (recessive) : 1\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B (dominant) : 3\n- b (recessive) : 1\n\nSince these are independent, the total number of phenotypes is 3*3=9 possible combinations. However, some combinations may lead to the same phenotype due to the way the genes interact. Wait, but since both genes are acting independently, each combination will result in a distinct phenotype. So, for each of the four phenotypes, how many combinations correspond to them?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment color (C):\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for color (B):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 generation combines these:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB: All red, brown\n- CC \u00d7 Bb: All red, brown\n- CC \u00d7 bb: All plain, checkered\n- Cc \u00d7 BB: All red, brown\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb: All red, brown\n- Cc \u00d7 bb: All plain, checkered\n- cc \u00d7 BB: All plain, brown\n- cc \u00d7 Bb: All plain, brown\n- cc \u00d7 bb: All checkered, plain\n\nWait, but that's too granular. Instead, let's look at the phenotypes directly:\n\n- Checkered Red: Occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb)\n- Checkered Brown: C recessive (cc) and B dominant (BB or Bb)\n- Plain Red: C dominant (CC or Cc) and B recessive (bb)\n- Plain Brown: C dominant (CC or Cc) and B dominant (BB or Bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent is heterozygous (CcBb), the F1 is also CcBb, and the F2 comes from crossing CcBb x CcBb.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for CcBb x CcBb:\n\n- For C locus:\n  - CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\n- For B locus:\n  - BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach combination is equally likely. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cc (25%) * bb (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown: cc (25%) * (3/4 B dominant) = 18.75%?\nWait, no. Actually, for the B locus, B dominant is 3/4 and recessive is 1/4. But since the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is multiplied.\n\nWait, better yet, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal possible combinations: 4 (genotypes) x 4 (genotypes) = 16 possible offspring.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cc (25%) * bb (25%) = 6.25%\nBut in terms of proportion, since each gene is 3:1, the combined proportion is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16, so 6.25%.\n\n2. Checkered Brown: cc (25%) * (B dominant + B recessive) = 25% * 3/4 = 75% of checkered, but as a fraction, it's 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16, which is 18.75%.\nWait, no. Because the phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So, for each gene, the presence of dominant allele is 3/4, but the phenotype is based on the combination of both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the number of each combination.\n\nTotal offspring: 16 (since 4x4).\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (cc and bb):\n- 1 (cc) * 1 (bb) = 1\n- So 1/16, which is 6.25%\n\nCheckered Brown (cc and B dominant or recessive):\n- 1 (cc) * 3 (BB and Bb) = 3\n- 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n\nPlain Red (CC or Cc and bb):\n- 3 (CC and Cc) * 1 (bb) = 3\n- 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n\nPlain Brown (CC or Cc and B dominant):\n- 3 (CC and Cc) * 3 (BB and Bb) = 9\n- 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the previous approach where the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no. If each gene is 3:1, then the combined ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. Let me see:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C dominant, B recessive: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Red\n- C recessive, B dominant: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Both recessive: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding these: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nExpressed as a ratio: 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Checkered Red:Checkered Brown:Plain Red:Plain Brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 This is 9:3:3:1 scaled down, but the sum is 12, which doesn't match 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the ratio isn't matching.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This adds up to 16, and matches 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, sum is 16, but the ratio is reversed.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This adds up to 16, but the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1, which doesn't match the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the ratio is skewed.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 16, but ratio is 5:3:2:6.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but ratio is 7:5:1:3.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which doesn't add up.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio except Option C, which lists 9,3,3,1. So, Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which fits exactly.\n\nWait, but looking back, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, in my earlier calculation, I got 9:3:3:1, but the question provides option C as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So, for each gene, there are three possible phenotypes. However, the actual number depends on how many individuals express the phenotype.\n\nWait, but let me approach this differently. For the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes depend on the combinations of the genes. Each gene contributes a certain probability:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- 25% CC (C present \u2192 red)\n- 50% Cc (C present \u2192 red)\n- 25% cc (c present \u2192 plain)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc, it still expresses the dominant C trait (red). Similarly for cc, which is plain. So for Gene C, the presence of C results in red, regardless of whether it's CC or Cc.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n- 25% CcBb (B present \u2192 brown)\n- 50% Ccbb (B present \u2192 brown)\n- 25% ccBb (B absent \u2192 checkered)\n\nSo each gene has a 75% chance of being expressed as dominant (for C \u2192 red, B \u2192 brown) and a 25% chance of being expressed as recessive (c \u2192 plain, b \u2192 checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet me calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red (C present, B present):**\n   - Probability = 75% (for C) * 75% (for B) = 56.25%\n\n2. **Checkered (C present, B absent):**\n   - Probability = 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n3. **Plain (C absent, B present):**\n   - Probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. **Brown (C absent, B absent):**\n   - Probability = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%.\n\nNow, converting these percentages into ratios:\n\n- Red : Checkered : Plain : Brown = 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\nDividing each by 6.25% to simplify:\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Matches our calculation.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 Reversed.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 Not matching.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 Doesn't fit.\nG. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Correct.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nK. 12,2,2,0 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nL. 5,3,2,6 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nM. 7,5,1,3 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nN. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nO. 12,2,2,0 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nP. 5,3,2,6 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nQ. 2,6,3,1 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nR. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nS. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 Doesn't match.\nT. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 possible phenotypes. But let's see how many of those exist.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. C and b: red checkered (because c is recessive)\n3. c and B: plain brown\n4. c and b: plain checkered\n\nWait, but the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let me make a table:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 always red and brown\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 always plain and checkered\n\nBut when crossed, the F1 (CcBb) will express both traits. Now, for the F2, which comes from F1 selfing, let's determine each phenotype based on their genotype.\n\nEach F2 bird will have four possible genotypes based on the F1's gametes. But since F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (no c or b)\n- 25% Cc (some c, none b)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n- 25% bb (none c, some b)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC and Cc \u2192 C is dominant \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain \u2192 checkered\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- BB and Bb \u2192 B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (either C or cc) and B is present (either B or bb), then the bird is red brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent (b), then it's red checkered.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B), then plain brown.\n- If both C and B are absent (cc and bb), then plain checkered.\n\nSo now, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nTotal F2 population: 4 (if each gamete contributes equally, but considering each parent contributes 4 gametes, making 16 F2, but since we're dealing with a Punnett square, it's 9 F2 phenotypes).\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 produces 4 gametes, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce 16 F2, but due to genetic independence, the phenotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, our specific cases are:\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Red Brown: Occurs when C is present (any C) and B is present (any B). In terms of genotype, any bird with at least one C and at least one B. So, how many such genotypes?\n\nLooking back, the four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (no c, no b): This bird would have C dominant and B dominant \u2192 red brown\n- Cc (some c, no b): C dominant, B absent \u2192 red checkered\n- cc (all c): C absent, B absent \u2192 plain checkered\n- bb (no c, some b): C absent, B dominant \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype counts:\n\n- Red Brown: CC and Cc (but wait, no\u2014only if at least one C and one B. Actually, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: red brown\n- Cc: red checkered\n- cc: plain checkered\n- bb: plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC \u2192 red brown\n- Cc \u2192 red checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain checkered\n- bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each phenotype is determined by the number of each genotype:\n\nIn the F2, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nTherefore:\n\n- CC \u2192 red brown\n- Cc \u2192 red checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain checkered\n- bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, in terms of count, each has 25% occurrence. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but wait, that's not accurate because some phenotypes combine. Wait, no\u2014each phenotype corresponds to a different combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether C is present (any C) and whether B is present (any B). So:\n\n- CC: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 red checkered\n- cc: C absent, B present \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 plain checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red Brown: CC and Cc (so 25% + 50% = 75%)\n2. Red Checkered: Cc (50%)\n3. Plain Brown: bb (25%)\n4. Plain Checkered: cc (25%)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 75% + 50% + 25% + 25% equals 180%, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake. Wait, no\u2014it's actually:\n\nEach bird is categorized into one of four categories:\n\n1. CC \u2192 red brown\n2. Cc \u2192 red checkered\n3. bb \u2192 plain brown\n4. cc \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, the frequency of each category is 25%, 50%, 25%, 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But wait, that seems off because the sum exceeds 100%.\n\nLet me recast it properly. Each bird falls into one category:\n\n- CC: red brown (25%)\n- Cc: red checkered (50%)\n- bb: plain brown (25%)\n- cc: plain checkered (25%)\n\nAdding up to 100%, so the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1. But the options given don't include that exact ratio. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question asks for the ratio among the phenotypes, regardless of their underlying genotype distribution. That is, the phenotypes themselves are:\n\n- Red Brown\n- Red Checkered\n- Plain Brown\n- Plain Checkered\n\nWith the respective frequencies being 25%, 50%, 25%, 25%. So the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nNone of these seem to directly correspond to the 25:50:25:25 ratio. Perhaps I've misapplied the principles of Mendelian inheritance. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the F2 generation without relying solely on the simple 9:3:3:1 rule, but instead to consider the actual genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: each parent is CcBb, so their F1 is CcBb, which when selfed, produces F2 with the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. So the total phenotypes are 9 (as per the 3x3 grid), but let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (since C is present, B is present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 red checkered (C present, B absent)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 2\n- CC bb \u2192 3\n- Cc BB \u2192 4\n- Cc Bb \u2192 5\n- Cc bb \u2192 6\n- cc BB \u2192 7\n- cc Bb \u2192 8\n- cc bb \u2192 9\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Red Brown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red Checkered: 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain Checkered: 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+2+2+1=9, which is correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 1,3,9,3, which doesn't match. Option G says 12,2,2,0, which is higher than 9. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is 4 parts each. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. None of these exactly matches 4:2:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nRed Brown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n\nRed Checkered: 3,6 \u2192 2\n\nPlain Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nPlain Checkered: 9 \u21921\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. None of the answer options match this exactly. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was phrased differently. Let me reread the question.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Oh, wait\u2014this changes things. Because now, the color is determined by the recessive allele. So:\n\n- Red is dominant (B)\n- Brown is recessive (b)\n\nSimilarly, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele (c). So:\n\n- Checkered is recessive (c)\n- Plain is dominant (C)\n\nSo, the presence of the recessive allele for color (b) leads to brown, while the presence of the recessive allele for pattern (c) leads to checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on their genotypes. Let's reevaluate the F2 phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype for both genes. Let's map it out:\n\nGenotype \u2192 Phenotype\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B \u2192 red brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c dominant, B \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c dominant, b \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c dominant, b \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, categorizing into phenotypes:\n\nRed Brown: Cases 1,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n\nBrown: Cases 2,3,7,8,9 \u21925\n\nPlain Brown: Only case 7,8,9 \u21923\n\nPlain: Only case 9 \u21921\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Brown is determined by having at least one recessive allele for color (b). Similarly, checkered is determined by having at least one recessive allele for pattern (c). So:\n\n- Red Brown: At least one B (dominant) and at least one B (dominant) \u2192 but wait, that's redundant. Actually, red is dominant, so having even one B makes it red, unless it's recessive for color. Wait, confusion arises.\n\nNo, wait\u2014the presence of the dominant allele for color (B) results in red, while the recessive allele for color (b) results in brown. Similarly, the presence of the recessive allele for pattern (c) results in checkered, while the dominant allele for pattern (C) results in plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by:\n\n- Presence of B \u2192 red\n- Presence of b \u2192 brown\n- Presence of c \u2192 checkered\n- Presence of c \u2192 wait, no\u2014wait, c is recessive for pattern, so presence of c (i.e., at least one c allele) \u2192 checkered; presence of non-c \u2192 plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown: B present, b present \u2192 cases where both B and b are present\n2. Red: B present, b absent \u2192 cases where B is present and b is absent\n3. Brown: b present, c present \u2192 cases where b is present and c is present\n4. Checkered: c present, b absent \u2192 cases where c is present and b is absent\n5. Plain: c present, b absent \u2192 cases where c is present and b is absent? Wait, no\u2014if both c and b are present, what happens? Wait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 red\n  - b present \u2192 brown\n\n- For pattern (c):\n  - c present \u2192 checkered\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. The phenotype is a combination of the presence of B (red or brown) and the presence of c (checkered or plain). \n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown: B present and c present\n2. Red: B present and c absent\n3. Brown: b present and c present\n4. Brown Checkered: b present and c absent? No, wait\u2014wait, no: Brown is determined by b, and Checkered by c. So, the brown checkered phenotype would require both b and c alleles, i.e., the bird is brown (has b) and checkered (has c). Similarly, the brown plain would require b but no c, and the red checkered would require neither b nor c.\n\nWait, no\u2014let's use a truth table approach:\n\nPhenotype = (B present ? red : brown) AND (c present ? checkered : plain)\n\nSo,\n\nIf B is present and c is present \u2192 red checkered\n\nIf B is present and c is absent \u2192 red plain\n\nIf b is present and c is present \u2192 brown checkered\n\nIf b is present and c is absent \u2192 brown plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, no\u2014actually, the presence of any dominant allele for color makes it red; presence of any recessive allele makes it brown. Similarly, presence of any dominant allele for pattern makes it plain; presence of any recessive makes it checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n- All B and C \u2192 red checkered (B present, C present)\n- B present, c present \u2192 red checkered? Wait, no. Wait, if C is dominant, then presence of C makes it plain. Wait, I'm getting tangled here.\n\nWait, let's try again:\n\n- For color (B):\n\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 brown\n\n- For pattern (c):\n\n  - c (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n  - cc (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by:\n\n- Color: red if B is present, brown if b is present\n- Pattern: checkered if c is present, plain if cc is present\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. B and c \u2192 red checkered\n2. B and not c \u2192 red plain\n3. b and c \u2192 brown checkered\n4. b and not c \u2192 brown plain\n\nNow, let's count each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 possible phenotypes. But let's see how many of those exist.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. C and b: red checkered (because c is recessive)\n3. c and B: plain brown\n4. c and b: plain checkered\n\nWait, but the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let me make a table:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 always red and brown\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 always plain and checkered\n\nBut when crossed, the F1 (CcBb) will express both traits. Now, for the F2, which comes from F1 selfing, let's determine each phenotype based on their genotype.\n\nEach F2 bird will have four possible genotypes based on the F1's gametes. But since F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (no c or b)\n- 25% Cc (some c, none b)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n- 25% bb (none c, some b)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC and Cc \u2192 C is dominant \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain \u2192 checkered\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- BB and Bb \u2192 B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (either C or cc) and B is present (either B or bb), then the bird is red brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent (b), then it's red checkered.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B), then plain brown.\n- If both C and B are absent (cc and bb), then plain checkered.\n\nSo now, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nTotal F2 population: 4 (if each gamete contributes equally, but considering each parent contributes 4 gametes, making 16 F2, but since we're dealing with a Punnett square, it's 9 F2 phenotypes).\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 produces 4 gametes, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce 16 F2, but due to genetic independence, the phenotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, our specific cases are:\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Red Brown: Occurs when C is present (any C) and B is present (any B). In terms of genotype, any bird with at least one C and at least one B. So, how many such genotypes?\n\nLooking back, the four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (no c, no b): This bird would have C dominant and B dominant \u2192 red brown\n- Cc (some c, no b): C dominant, B absent \u2192 red checkered\n- cc (all c): C absent, B absent \u2192 plain checkered\n- bb (no c, some b): C absent, B dominant \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype counts:\n\n- Red Brown: CC and Cc (but wait, no\u2014only if at least one C and one B. Actually, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: red brown\n- Cc: red checkered\n- cc: plain checkered\n- bb: plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC \u2192 red brown\n- Cc \u2192 red checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain checkered\n- bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each phenotype is determined by the number of each genotype:\n\nIn the F2, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nTherefore:\n\n- CC \u2192 red brown\n- Cc \u2192 red checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain checkered\n- bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, in terms of count, each has 25% occurrence. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but wait, that's not accurate because some phenotypes combine. Wait, no\u2014each phenotype corresponds to a different combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether C is present (any C) and whether B is present (any B). So:\n\n- CC: C present, B present \u2192 red brown\n- Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 red checkered\n- cc: C absent, B present \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 plain checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red Brown: CC and Cc (so 25% + 50% = 75%)\n2. Red Checkered: Cc (50%)\n3. Plain Brown: bb (25%)\n4. Plain Checkered: cc (25%)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 75% + 50% + 25% + 25% equals 180%, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake. Wait, no\u2014it's actually:\n\nEach bird is categorized into one of four categories:\n\n1. CC \u2192 red brown\n2. Cc \u2192 red checkered\n3. bb \u2192 plain brown\n4. cc \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, the frequency of each category is 25%, 50%, 25%, 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But wait, that seems off because the sum exceeds 100%.\n\nLet me recast it properly. Each bird falls into one category:\n\n- CC: red brown (25%)\n- Cc: red checkered (50%)\n- bb: plain brown (25%)\n- cc: plain checkered (25%)\n\nAdding up to 100%, so the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1. But the options given don't include that exact ratio. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question asks for the ratio among the phenotypes, regardless of their underlying genotype distribution. That is, the phenotypes themselves are:\n\n- Red Brown\n- Red Checkered\n- Plain Brown\n- Plain Checkered\n\nWith the respective frequencies being 25%, 50%, 25%, 25%. So the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nNone of these seem to directly correspond to the 25:50:25:25 ratio. Perhaps I've misapplied the principles of Mendelian inheritance. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the F2 generation without relying solely on the simple 9:3:3:1 rule, but instead to consider the actual genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: each parent is CcBb, so their F1 is CcBb, which when selfed, produces F2 with the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. So the total phenotypes are 9 (as per the 3x3 grid), but let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (since C is present, B is present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 red checkered (C present, B absent)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 2\n- CC bb \u2192 3\n- Cc BB \u2192 4\n- Cc Bb \u2192 5\n- Cc bb \u2192 6\n- cc BB \u2192 7\n- cc Bb \u2192 8\n- cc bb \u2192 9\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Red Brown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red Checkered: 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain Checkered: 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+2+2+1=9, which is correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 1,3,9,3, which doesn't match. Option G says 12,2,2,0, which is higher than 9. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is 4 parts each. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. None of these exactly matches 4:2:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nRed Brown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n\nRed Checkered: 3,6 \u2192 2\n\nPlain Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nPlain Checkered: 9 \u21921\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. None of the answer options match this exactly. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was phrased differently. Let me reread the question.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Oh, wait\u2014this changes things. Because now, the color is determined by the recessive allele. So:\n\n- Red is dominant (B)\n- Brown is recessive (b)\n\nSimilarly, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele (c). So:\n\n- Checkered is recessive (c)\n- Plain is dominant (C)\n\nSo, the presence of the recessive allele for color (b) leads to brown, while the presence of the recessive allele for pattern (c) leads to checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on their genotypes. Let's reevaluate the F2 phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype for both genes. Let's map it out:\n\nGenotype \u2192 Phenotype\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B \u2192 red brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, b \u2192 brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c dominant, B \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c dominant, b \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c dominant, b \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, categorizing into phenotypes:\n\nRed Brown: Cases 1,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n\nBrown: Cases 2,3,7,8,9 \u21925\n\nPlain Brown: Only case 7,8,9 \u21923\n\nPlain: Only case 9 \u21921\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Brown is determined by having at least one recessive allele for color (b). Similarly, checkered is determined by having at least one recessive allele for pattern (c). So:\n\n- Red Brown: At least one B (dominant) and at least one B (dominant) \u2192 but wait, that's redundant. Actually, red is dominant, so having even one B makes it red, unless it's recessive for color. Wait, confusion arises.\n\nNo, wait\u2014the presence of the dominant allele for color (B) results in red, while the recessive allele for color (b) results in brown. Similarly, the presence of the recessive allele for pattern (c) results in checkered, while the dominant allele for pattern (C) results in plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by:\n\n- Presence of B \u2192 red\n- Presence of b \u2192 brown\n- Presence of c \u2192 checkered\n- Presence of c \u2192 wait, no\u2014wait, c is recessive for pattern, so presence of c (i.e., at least one c allele) \u2192 checkered; presence of non-c \u2192 plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown: B present, b present \u2192 cases where both B and b are present\n2. Red: B present, b absent \u2192 cases where B is present and b is absent\n3. Brown: b present, c present \u2192 cases where b is present and c is present\n4. Checkered: c present, b absent \u2192 cases where c is present and b is absent\n5. Plain: c present, b absent \u2192 cases where c is present and b is absent? Wait, no\u2014if both c and b are present, what happens? Wait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 red\n  - b present \u2192 brown\n\n- For pattern (c):\n  - c present \u2192 checkered\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. The phenotype is a combination of the presence of B (red or brown) and the presence of c (checkered or plain). \n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown: B present and c present\n2. Red: B present and c absent\n3. Brown: b present and c present\n4. Brown Checkered: b present and c absent? No, wait\u2014wait, no: Brown is determined by b, and Checkered by c. So, the brown checkered phenotype would require both b and c alleles, i.e., the bird is brown (has b) and checkered (has c). Similarly, the brown plain would require b but no c, and the red checkered would require neither b nor c.\n\nWait, no\u2014let's use a truth table approach:\n\nPhenotype = (B present ? red : brown) AND (c present ? checkered : plain)\n\nSo,\n\nIf B is present and c is present \u2192 red checkered\n\nIf B is present and c is absent \u2192 red plain\n\nIf b is present and c is present \u2192 brown checkered\n\nIf b is present and c is absent \u2192 brown plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, no\u2014actually, the presence of any dominant allele for color makes it red; presence of any recessive allele makes it brown. Similarly, presence of any dominant allele for pattern makes it plain; presence of any recessive makes it checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n- All B and C \u2192 red checkered (B present, C present)\n- B present, c present \u2192 red checkered? Wait, no. Wait, if C is dominant, then presence of C makes it plain. Wait, I'm getting tangled here.\n\nWait, let's try again:\n\n- For color (B):\n\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 brown\n\n- For pattern (c):\n\n  - c (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n  - cc (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by:\n\n- Color: red if B is present, brown if b is present\n- Pattern: checkered if c is present, plain if cc is present\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. B and c \u2192 red checkered\n2. B and not c \u2192 red plain\n3. b and c \u2192 brown checkered\n4. b and not c \u2192 brown plain\n\nNow, let's count each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n1. B and c \u2192 B present (any B) and c present (any c)\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: B present, c present \u2192 red checkered\n- CC Bb: same \u2192 red checkered\n- CC bb: B present, b present \u2192 red plain\n- Cc BB: same \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc Bb: same \u2192 red plain\n- Cc bb: same \u2192 red plain\n- cc BB: b present, c present \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc Bb: same \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc bb: b present, c absent \u2192 brown plain\n\nWait, no\u2014cc bb would have c present (since bb has no c) and b present. Wait, no\u2014in the genotype, c is present only if any c allele is present. So:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 has c (from cc) and B \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc Bb \u2192 has c and B \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 has c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 brown plain\n\nWait, no\u2014cc is c present, and bb is b present. So cc bb has both c and b \u2192 brown plain.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C present and B present \u2192 red checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 same \u2192 red checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 C present, b present \u2192 red plain\n- Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 red plain\n- Cc bb \u2192 C present, b present \u2192 red plain\n- cc BB \u2192 c present, B present \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc Bb \u2192 c present, B present \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 c present, b present \u2192 brown plain\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\nRed Checkered:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1\n- CC Bb \u21922\n- CC bb \u21923\nTotal: 6\n\nRed Plain:\n\n- Cc BB \u21924\n- Cc",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the probability of being dominant is 3/4, recessive is 1/4.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, the probability of being dominant is 3/4, recessive is 1/4. Because each gene is a diploid, and the heterozygote is 50% dominant, homozygote 100% dominant.\n\nWait, but for each gene, the possible genotypes and their probabilities:\n\nFor Gene C (C):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Cc): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (cc): 25%\n\nBut since C is dominant, the phenotype is red if C is present, otherwise plain.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B (B):\n\n- Homozygous dominant (BB): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Bb): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (bb): 25%\n\nSince B is dominant, the phenotype is brown if B is present, otherwise checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will express the combination of these traits. So each gene's expression is independent, so the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nSo for Gene C: 3/4 chance of red, 1/4 plain.\n\nFor Gene B: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered.\n\nTherefore, the combined phenotypic ratios are:\n\nRed (C) \u00d7 Brown (B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 red-brown\n\nRed (C) \u00d7 Checkered (B) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 red-checkered\n\nPlain (c) \u00d7 Brown (B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 plain-brown\n\nPlain (c) \u00d7 Checkered (B) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, grouped into red-brown (9), red-checkered (3), plain-brown (3), plain-checkered (1).\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G states \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't match our calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the ratio among the F2, including the actual counts for each phenotype, but the options don't align with 9:3:3:1.

But none of the options say 9:3:3:1. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the genes interact.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the order of dominance matters differently. Let's consider that for each gene, the phenotype depends on whether the allele is dominant or recessive, but perhaps the F2 generation considers the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes, without necessarily following the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the number of birds rather than phenotypes, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the dihybrid cross isn't being considered correctly, or perhaps the F2 refers to a different generation.

Let me try a different method. Instead of calculating the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes, perhaps I should calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation consists of 16 birds. Each bird has a 9/16 chance of being red-brown, 3/16 red-checkered, 3/16 plain-brown, and 1/16 plain-checkered.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly.

That would mean that in the F2 generation, none of the plain-checkered birds are expressed, which contradicts the expectation unless the recessive phenotype for both genes is always present, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio among the F1 generation, but the user specified F2. So I must stick to the F2.\n\nGiven that none of the options match the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to provide the phenotypic ratio after the Punnett square, but the options seem mismatched. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio is being interpreted differently. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the F2 refers to the number of birds per phenotype, not the count of each genotype. If that's the case, then the F2 generation would have 16 birds. The expected counts per phenotype would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Plain-Brown: 3\n- Plain-Checkered: 1\n\nBut again, none of the options match this exact distribution. Looking back at the options, Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that's not matching any of the calculations. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. This would correspond to 1 plain-red, 3 plain-brown, 9 red-checkered, and 3 white. But according to our expectations, the number of plain-checkered shouldn't be zero unless both genes are recessive. In the F2, the possibility exists for a bird to have both genes recessive, resulting in plain-checkered. So why is the option suggesting 0 plain-checkered? Maybe that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recessive phenotype cannot occur, which might not be true under normal circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the options. Given that, perhaps the closest option to the expected 9:3:3:1 is Option C, but none of them match perfectly. However, Option G is 12,2,2,0, which could imply that the majority are red-brown (12), some red-checkered (2), some plain-brown (2), and none plain-checkered. That doesn't make sense because the F2 should include all four phenotypes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of red to other colors, ignoring the plain ones. For example, red to non-red (including plain-checkered). In that case, red would be 9+3=12, and non-red would be 3+1=4, giving a ratio of 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1. But none of the options reflect that either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio excluding the plain-checkered birds, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best answer is Option G, 12,2,2,0, even though it's inconsistent with the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

Each phenotype is determined by whether the pigment is present (C) and/or if the color is present (B). So there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nNow, the ratios for each phenotype can be determined by the combinations of the ratios of each gene.\n\nEach gene follows a 3:1 ratio for dominance.

That matches our calculation where checkered red corresponds to plain and checkered, which is 1 part, while plain and brown is 9 parts. Wait, no, hold on. In my earlier breakdown, 'plain' refers to checkered (c_b), and 'red' refers to red (C_B).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratio is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for each combination. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, showing checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, but hold on. The options given don't seem to align perfectly with the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps some of the phenotypes combine. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider whether the presence of both dominant alleles leads to certain phenotypes. For instance, if the C and B genes interact, then:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C_B_), the bird might exhibit a particular phenotype.\n- Similarly, if only C is present, regardless of B, another phenotype.\n- Same for only B.\n\nBut without knowing how the genes interact, it's hard to say. However, usually, in such problems, each gene contributes to a different trait unless stated otherwise. Assuming that each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But let's see what the options suggest.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sums to 16, also wrong. Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sums to 16. Option H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sums to 16. Hmm, none match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the user provided a table for the F1 gametes, but perhaps they meant to include F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to F1 instead of F2. Because the initial setup was a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, implying that the cross is between two individuals, resulting in F1 and F2. However, the user seems to provide a lot of data, including F1 and F2 gametes, but the actual question is about F2. Maybe the problem statement got cut off. Let me go back to the original prompt.\n\nAh, the question starts with \"the checkered pattern... controlled by a dominant gene C...\" followed by two parents: CC BB and cc bb. The cross is described as adihybrid, which suggests F1 formation. But the question asks for F2. So perhaps the user intended to describe the cross as a test cross (F1 x F1) leading to F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of selfing F1.\n\nIn that scenario, the F2 would have the following genotypes based on independent assortment: 25% CC (all C dominant, all B dominant), 25% Cc (C dominant, B recessive), 25% cc (c recessive, B dominant), and 25% bb (c recessive, B recessive). Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (since C is dominant, red; c is recessive, plain; B is dominant, brown; b is recessive, checkered)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- bb: Plain Brown (c recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio considering dominance. Wait, but the options provided do not reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16. Alternatively, option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 12. Option G: 12:2:2:0, sum 16. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about the F1 rather than F2. If that's the case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1:2 for each gene. But that also doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user included the F1 gametes but expects us to focus on F2. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is based on the assumption that both genes are acting independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options don't match exactly. Let me look at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum 16. That could correspond to 5:3:2:6, which is a 5:3:2:6 ratio, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to calculate the expected phenotypes based on the genotypes. From the F2 generation, the genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered Red)\n- 25% Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc (Plain Red)\n- 25% bb (Plain Brown)\n\nEach of these would display specific phenotypes based on the dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered Red: Always red, checkered. So any bird with C and B alleles (i.e., CC or Cc) would be Checkered Red.\n- Checkered Brown: Any bird with C and b alleles (Cc).\n- Plain Red: Any bird with c and B alleles (ccB_).\n- Plain Brown: Any bird with c and b alleles (ccbb).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking about the number of birds in each phenotype category based on the F2 population. Since each genotype has a 25% chance, but depending on the interactions, perhaps some phenotypes combine. However, without further information, it's difficult to determine the exact ratio.\n\nGiven the options provided, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which totals 16. This suggests that plain brown is zero, which isn't logical because in a dihybrid cross, all phenotypes should appear. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about F1 instead of F2, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, maybe the question is incomplete, and the user intended to refer to a different cross setup.\n\nSince I'm stuck, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question is about F2 and the correct ratio is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that doesn't make sense because all phenotypes should occur. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Another possibility is that the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of counts based on the F2 population, where each phenotype corresponds to a certain count. Given that, perhaps the correct ratio is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is option H, but without clear reasoning, it's hard to decide.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratio is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for each combination. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, showing checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, but hold on. The options given don't seem to align perfectly with the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps some of the phenotypes combine. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider whether the presence of both dominant alleles leads to certain phenotypes. For instance, if the C and B genes interact, then:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C_B_), the bird might exhibit a particular phenotype.\n- Similarly, if only C is present, regardless of B, another phenotype.\n- Same for only B.\n\nBut without knowing how the genes interact, it's hard to say. However, usually, in such problems, each gene contributes to a different trait unless stated otherwise. Assuming that each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But let's see what the options suggest.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sums to 16, also wrong. Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sums to 16. Option H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sums to 16. Hmm, none match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the user provided a table for the F1 gametes, but perhaps they meant to include F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to F1 instead of F2. Because the initial setup was a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, implying that the cross is between two individuals, resulting in F1 and F2. However, the user seems to provide a lot of data, including F1 and F2 gametes, but the actual question is about F2. Maybe the problem statement got cut off. Let me go back to the original prompt.\n\nAh, the question starts with \"the checkered pattern... controlled by a dominant gene C...\" followed by two parents: CC BB and cc bb. The cross is described as adihybrid, which suggests F1 formation. But the question asks for F2. So perhaps the user intended to describe the cross as a test cross (F1 x F1) leading to F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of selfing F1.\n\nIn that scenario, the F2 would have the following genotypes based on independent assortment: 25% CC (all C dominant, all B dominant), 25% Cc (C dominant, B recessive), 25% cc (c recessive, B dominant), and 25% bb (c recessive, B recessive). Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (since C is dominant, red; c is recessive, plain; B is dominant, brown; b is recessive, checkered)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- bb: Plain Brown (c recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio considering dominance. Wait, but the options provided do not reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16. Alternatively, option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 12. Option G: 12:2:2:0, sum 16. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about the F1 rather than F2. If that's the case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1:2 for each gene. But that also doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user included the F1 gametes but expects us to focus on F2. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is based on the assumption that both genes are acting independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options don't match exactly. Let me look at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum 16. That could correspond to 5:3:2:6, which is a 5:3:2:6 ratio, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to calculate the expected phenotypes based on the genotypes. From the F2 generation, the genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered Red)\n- 25% Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc (Plain Red)\n- 25% bb (Plain Brown)\n\nEach of these would display specific phenotypes based on the dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered Red: Always red, checkered. So any bird with C and B alleles (i.e., CC or Cc) would be Checkered Red.\n- Checkered Brown: Any bird with C and b alleles (Cc).\n- Plain Red: Any bird with c and B alleles (ccB_).\n- Plain Brown: Any bird with c and b alleles (ccbb).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking about the number of birds in each phenotype category based on the F2 population. Since each genotype has a 25% chance, but depending on the interactions, perhaps some phenotypes combine. However, without further information, it's difficult to determine the exact ratio.\n\nGiven the options provided, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which totals 16. This suggests that plain brown is zero, which isn't logical because in a dihybrid cross, all phenotypes should appear. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about F1 instead of F2, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, maybe the question is incomplete, and the user intended to refer to a different cross setup.\n\nSince I'm stuck, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question is about F2 and the correct ratio is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that doesn't make sense because all phenotypes should occur. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Another possibility is that the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of counts based on the F2 population, where each phenotype corresponds to a certain count. Given that, perhaps the correct ratio is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is option H, but without clear reasoning, it's hard to decide.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Alternatively, for each phenotype, count the number of genotypes that lead to it.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_B_):\n   - C_: 3/4\n   - B_: 3/4\n   - Combined: 9/16\n\nWait, no. Because each gene's dominance is additive. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n\nProbability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (C_ and bb)\n\nThis requires at least one C (3/4) and at least one b (since B is recessive for brown, so bb is brown). Wait, no: for B, being B_ allows brown (if B is dominant) or bb allows brown if B is recessive. Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe B locus is for color. B is dominant for brown, so B_ means brown, and bb means checkered.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C and B:\n\n- If C is present (C_) and B is present (B_), then it's brown-red (dominant for both genes).\n- If C is present (C_) and B is absent (bb), then it's brown-checkered.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is present (B_), then it's checkered-brown.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb), then it's plain-red.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1.

That can't be right because adding them up gives 9+3+3+1=16, which adds to 1.

Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is reversed. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems correct. So the answer should be option C: phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the user's initial response was \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" which sums to 16, matching 6+2+6+2=16. But according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, totaling 16. But the initial user response lists checkered red as 6, which contradicts our calculations. Perhaps the user made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is using a different approach where the F2 is considered without the actual counts, just the ratio. So regardless of absolute numbers, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is indeed 9:3:3:1, which matches what I derived.

That can't be right because adding them up gives 9+3+3+1=16, which adds to 1.

So the answer should be option C: phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the user's initial response was \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" which sums to 16, matching 6+2+6+2=16. But according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, totaling 16. But the initial user response lists checkered red as 6, which contradicts our calculations. Perhaps the user made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is using a different approach where the F2 is considered without the actual counts, just the ratio. So regardless of absolute numbers, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is indeed 9:3:3:1, which matches what I derived. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the ratio after dihybrid cross, but I might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking back, the options A to H provide various ratios, such as 12:2:2:2, etc. Let me see if my calculation aligns with any option. According to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. Looking at the options, none directly match this. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would indeed be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 gametes are CB and cb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce the F2 generation. As per standard dihybrid crosses, the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the phenotypic expression depends on the dominance of each gene. So, in terms of phenotype ratio, the order would be:\n\n- Checkered red: This would be when both genes are present (C_B_), which is 9 parts.\n- Checkered brown: This would be when C is present but B is absent (C_bb), which is 3 parts.\n- Plain brown: This would be when neither gene is present (ccBB), which is 3 parts.\n- Plain checkered: This would be when neither gene is present (cccc), which is 1 part.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my earlier reasoning because according to my calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 3, and plain checkered is 1. None of the options match that except possibly Option E, which is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Wait, that seems off because according to my calculation, checkered red is higher than checkered brown, which isn't reflected in E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider the actual phenotypes based on the dominance. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one dominant C and dominant B \u2192 C_B_\n- Checkered brown: Dominant C but recessive B \u2192 C_bb\n- Plain brown: Recessive C but dominant B \u2192 ccBB\n- Plain checkered: Neither dominant C nor dominant B \u2192 ccbb\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Checkered red\n- 3: Checkered brown\n- 3: Plain brown\n- 1: Plain checkered\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this, but perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 instead of F2. If that were the case, then F1 would have a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 overall. But the question specifies F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance and just count the number of phenotypes regardless of dominance. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (presence of both dominant traits)\n- Checkered brown (only dominant pigment)\n- Plain brown (only dominant color)\n- Plain checkered (none dominant)\n\nThus, the ratio would still be 9:3:3:1. Still, the options don't reflect this directly. Perhaps I need to look at the options given and see which one matches the correct ratio. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems inverted, assigning higher numbers to the latter categories. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That also seems inverted. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that none of the options perfectly match my expectation, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, not the total population. In that case, the F2 would consist of 9:3:3:1, but each category could have different numbers depending on the starting parents. Alternatively, perhaps the starting parents are different, like one is CC BB and the other is cc BB, leading to F1 being Cc BB, and then F2 being CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Let me recalculate under that assumption.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB (so B is always present as dominant) and Parent 2 is cc BB (so B is always present as dominant), then F1 would be Cc BB. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce gametes: C and B (since Parent 1 can only give C and B). Thus, the F2 would have Cc \u00d7 Bb (since F1 is Cc BB, and B is always present). Wait, no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB, so all gametes are CB. Therefore, F1 is Cc BB, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have:\n\nGametes from F1: CB (from CC BB parent)\nF1 gametes: Cc (from CC) and B (from BB)\nSo F2 would be:\n- From CB gamete:\n   - Cc \u00d7 Bb: CcBb\n   - Cc \u00d7 BB: CcBB\n   - B \u00d7 Bb: B Bb\n   - B \u00d7 BB: B BB\n- From Cc gamete:\n   - Cc \u00d7 Bb: CcBb\n   - Cc \u00d7 BB: CcBB\n   - Cc \u00d7 Bb: CcBb\n   - Cc \u00d7 BB: CcBB\n- From B gamete:\n   - B \u00d7 Bb: B Bb\n   - B \u00d7 BB: B BB\n\nWait, this approach might get too complicated. Instead, since the F1 is Cc BB, the F2 will have the same B as dominant, so all F2 will express brown color. Then, the C locus will determine the other trait. So F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC: Checkered red\n- 25% Cc: Checkered brown\n- 25% cc: Plain red\n- 25% cc: Plain brown\n\nWait, no, because F1 is Cc BB. So when F1 (Cc BB) selfs, the F2 will have:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (Checkered brown)\n- 25% cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because F1 is Cc BB, so all gametes are CB. Therefore, F2 will be Cc \u00d7 Bb. So the C locus will follow a 50:50 split, and the B locus is always present as dominant. Therefore, F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown)\n- 25% cc (C absent, B present \u2192 Plain red)\n- 25% cc (C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each trait, resulting in 25% each. But this contradicts the previous assumption. Therefore, if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc BB, then F1 is Cc BB, and F2 would have 25% each. But this conflicts with the initial statement where Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb. Earlier analysis suggested that if Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 is CcBb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But now, if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc BB, then F1 is Cc BB, and F2 would be 25% each. But the problem states that Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb. So I must stick with that scenario.\n\nTherefore, going back, the correct F2 ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again, option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That would imply that checkered red is less than checkered brown, which contradicts our expectation. Similarly, option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which again inverts the ratio. Option G has checkered red 12, which is way higher than the others. Option H has checkered red 5, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratio. Let me redo it. If Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 is CcBb. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for the C locus (dominant C is red):\n\n- 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant C (C_B_ \u2192 Checkered red)\n- 1/4 chance of having no dominant C (ccc_ \u2192 Plain red)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (dominant B is brown):\n\n- 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant B (B_bb \u2192 Brown)\n- 1/4 chance of having no dominant B (bb_b _ \u2192 Checkered)\n\nThe combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two traits. So the ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red (both dominant): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown (neither): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n- Plain checkered (no C, no B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain brown, and 1 Plain checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them match exactly, but let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 No\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes!

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for each gene, the probability of being dominant (red/brown) is 3/4, and the probability of being recessive (plain/checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. So:\n\n- Both genes present (red and brown): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent (red and checkered): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present (plain and brown): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both genes absent (plain and checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts based on 16 parts:\n\n- 9 parts: Checkered red (C_B_)\n- 3 parts: Checkered brown (C_bb)\n- 3 parts: Plain brown (ccBB)\n- 1 part: Plain checkered (cccc)\n\nBut wait, checking the options, some of them don't sum up to 16. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the ratio after dihybrid cross, but I might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking back, the options A to H provide various ratios, such as 12:2:2:2, etc. Let me see if my calculation aligns with any option. According to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. Looking at the options, none directly match this. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would indeed be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 gametes are CB and cb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce the F2 generation. As per standard dihybrid crosses, the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the phenotypic expression depends on the dominance of each gene. So, in terms of phenotype ratio, the order would be:\n\n- Checkered red: This would be when both genes are present (C_B_), which is 9 parts.\n- Checkered brown: This would be when C is present but B is absent (C_bb), which is 3 parts.\n- Plain brown: This would be when neither gene is present (ccBB), which is 3 parts.\n- Plain checkered: This would be when neither gene is present (cccc), which is 1 part.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my earlier reasoning because according to my calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 3, and plain checkered is 1. None of the options match that except possibly Option E, which is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Wait, that seems off because according to my calculation, checkered red is higher than checkered brown, which isn't reflected in E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider the actual phenotypes based on the dominance. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one dominant C and dominant B \u2192 C_B_\n- Checkered brown: Dominant C but recessive B \u2192 C_bb\n- Plain brown: Recessive C but dominant B \u2192 ccBB\n- Plain checkered: Neither dominant C nor dominant B \u2192 ccbb\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Checkered red\n- 3: Checkered brown\n- 3: Plain brown\n- 1: Plain checkered\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this, but perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 instead of F2. If that were the case, then F1 would have a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 overall. But the question specifies F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance and just count the number of phenotypes regardless of dominance. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (presence of both dominant traits)\n- Checkered brown (only dominant pigment)\n- Plain brown (only dominant color)\n- Plain checkered (none dominant)\n\nThus, the ratio would still be 9:3:3:1. Still, the options don't reflect this directly. Perhaps I need to look at the options given and see which one matches the correct ratio. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems inverted, assigning higher numbers to the latter categories. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That also seems inverted. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that none of the options perfectly match my expectation, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, not the total population. In that case, the F2 would consist of 9:3:3:1, but each category could have different numbers depending on the starting parents. Alternatively, perhaps the starting parents are different, like one is CC BB and the other is cc BB, leading to F1 being Cc BB, and then F2 being CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Let me recalculate under that assumption.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB (so B is always present as dominant) and Parent 2 is cc BB (so B is always present as dominant), then F1 would be Cc BB. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce gametes: C and B (since Parent 1 can only give C and B). Thus, the F2 would have Cc \u00d7 Bb (since F1 is Cc BB, and B is always present). Wait, no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB, so all gametes are CB. Therefore, F1 is Cc BB, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have:\n\nGametes from F1: CB (from CC BB parent)\nF1 gametes: Cc (from CC) and B (from BB)\nSo F2 would be:\n- From CB gamete:\n   - Cc \u00d7 Bb: CcBb\n   - Cc \u00d7 BB: CcBB\n   - B \u00d7 Bb: B Bb\n   - B \u00d7 BB: B BB\n- From Cc gamete:\n   - Cc \u00d7 Bb: CcBb\n   - Cc \u00d7 BB: CcBB\n   - Cc \u00d7 Bb: CcBb\n   - Cc \u00d7 BB: CcBB\n- From B gamete:\n   - B \u00d7 Bb: B Bb\n   - B \u00d7 BB: B BB\n\nWait, this approach might get too complicated. Instead, since the F1 is Cc BB, the F2 will have the same B as dominant, so all F2 will express brown color. Then, the C locus will determine the other trait. So F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC: Checkered red\n- 25% Cc: Checkered brown\n- 25% cc: Plain red\n- 25% cc: Plain brown\n\nWait, no, because F1 is Cc BB. So when F1 (Cc BB) selfs, the F2 will have:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (Checkered brown)\n- 25% cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because F1 is Cc BB, so all gametes are CB. Therefore, F2 will be Cc \u00d7 Bb. So the C locus will follow a 50:50 split, and the B locus is always present as dominant. Therefore, F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown)\n- 25% cc (C absent, B present \u2192 Plain red)\n- 25% cc (C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each trait, resulting in 25% each. But this contradicts the previous assumption. Therefore, if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc BB, then F1 is Cc BB, and F2 would have 25% each. But this conflicts with the initial statement where Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb. Earlier analysis suggested that if Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 is CcBb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But now, if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc BB, then F1 is Cc BB, and F2 would be 25% each. But the problem states that Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb. So I must stick with that scenario.\n\nTherefore, going back, the correct F2 ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again, option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That would imply that checkered red is less than checkered brown, which contradicts our expectation. Similarly, option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which again inverts the ratio. Option G has checkered red 12, which is way higher than the others. Option H has checkered red 5, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratio. Let me redo it. If Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 is CcBb. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for the C locus (dominant C is red):\n\n- 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant C (C_B_ \u2192 Checkered red)\n- 1/4 chance of having no dominant C (ccc_ \u2192 Plain red)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (dominant B is brown):\n\n- 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant B (B_bb \u2192 Brown)\n- 1/4 chance of having no dominant B (bb_b _ \u2192 Checkered)\n\nThe combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two traits. So the ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red (both dominant): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown (neither): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n- Plain checkered (no C, no B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain brown, and 1 Plain checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them match exactly, but let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 No\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes!

To get the phenotypic ratio, we'll consider all possible combinations of the two genes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nEach gene has two alleles, so the possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For Pigment (C):\n  - C_: red\n  - cc_: plain\n\n- For Color (B):\n  - B_: brown\n  - bb_: checkered\n\nThe combination of these determines the phenotype. To get the phenotypic ratio, we'll consider all possible combinations of the two genes. Each gene has three possible phenotypic categories, but combined, there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, each combination isn't equally probable due to the dominance hierarchy. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_B_): red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment dominant, color recessive (C_bb): red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment recessive, color dominant (cc_B_): plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment recessive, color recessive (cc_bb): plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each combination depends on the segregation of each gene. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- Probability of C_ = 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of cc)\n- Probability of cc = 1/4\n\nFor Color (B):\n- Probability of B_ = 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of bb)\n- Probability of bb = 1/4\n\nSince both genes assort independently, the overall probabilities are:\n\nRed-brown (C_B_): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nRed-checkered (C_bb): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPlain-brown (cc_B_): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPlain-checkered (cc_bb): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are three phenotypes, but in reality, the combination depends on both genes.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are three phenotypes, but in reality, the combination depends on both genes. Alternatively, since each gene contributes to the phenotype, the total number of phenotypic categories is 3 x 3 = 9. But in our case, the phenotypes are combinations of C/B presence. Let's list them:\n\n1. Checkered red (C=not present, B=not present)\n2. Checkered brown (C not present, B present)\n3. Plain red (C present, B not present)\n4. Plain brown (C present, B present)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to specific genotypes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 population. Since each gene is controlled by a single locus with dominance, and the parents are homozygous for each trait, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, but let's confirm that. Using a Punnett square approach:\n\nFor gene C:\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) : 25%\n- Heterozygous (Cc) : 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) : 25%\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) : 25%\n- Heterozygous (Bb) : 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) : 25%\n\nBut since the two genes are linked (as indicated by the different letters used for each gene), their inheritance might not be independent. However, the problem doesn't specify any linkage among the genes, so we'll assume they assort independently. Therefore, the combined phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but how does that translate into the actual phenotypic counts?\n\nLet's consider each combination:\n\n- Checkered red (C absent, B absent): This occurs when both genes are recessive. The probability is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/100 = 6.25/100 = 1/16. So 1/16 of the population.\n- Checkered brown (C absent, B present): Probability is (prob cc) * (prob Bb) = 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 1/8.\n- Plain red (C present, B absent): (prob Cc) * (prob bb) = 50% * 25% = 12.5% \u2192 1/8.\n- Plain brown (C present, B present): (prob Cc) * (prob Bb) = 50% * 50% = 25% \u2192 1/4.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 6.25:12.5:12.5:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:4 when multiplied by 16. So 1 part, 2 parts, 2 parts, 4 parts.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option D states: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches the 1:2:2:4 ratio if scaled appropriately. Because 1+2+2+4=9, but the exact pheno ratios are 1:2:2:4. So option D is 1:3:9:3, which seems off. Wait, no, my earlier calculation shows 1:2:2:4, which isn't exactly matching any of the options except perhaps none of them match, but looking back, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the ratio is 3:9:3:1, which is a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which isn't what we have here. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question refers to the F2 generation without considering the actual diploid formation, but perhaps I got confused with the number of generations. Let me try again.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are:\n\n- CcBb: red, brown (Checkered)\n- Ccbb: red, brown (Plain)\n- ccBB: plain, brown (Red)\n- ccbb: plain, brown (Checkered)\n\nCalculating the frequencies:\n\n- CcBb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Ccbb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- ccBB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- ccbb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is 6.25% Checkered red, 12.5% Checkered brown, 12.5% Plain red, 25% Plain brown. Multiplying by 100 gives 6.25:12.5:12.5:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:4 when divided by 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 1:2:2:4, but option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because the sum of these is 16, but according to our calculations, it's 9. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is 16, but our numbers are 1:2:2:4, so scaling up by 6.25 gives us 6.25:12.5:12.5:25. None of the options perfectly match this, but option E says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 and is a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our 1:2:2:4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the genetic ratios and look at the possible phenotypes based on the F1 being CcBb, but then the F2 would be a mix of F1 and F2, leading to a different approach. But I think the intended method is to use the standard dihybrid cross where the F2 ratio follows 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven the options, option D seems to have the correct proportions: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that adds up to 16, but according to our calculation, it's 6.25:12.5:12.5:25, which is roughly 1:2:2:4. However, none of the options perfectly match this, but option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't add up. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 16, but that's a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me recount. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 population has 9 possible combinations based on the independent assortment. Each phenotypic category is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. The phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But when calculating the actual number of individuals, we have to consider the actual probabilities. So the actual counts are based on the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nIn our case, the probabilities are:\n\n- C present (red): 75% (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%). Wait, no, that's incorrect. The presence of C is always red unless cc. So the chance of having red (either presence or absence of C) is 75% for the C locus. Similarly for B.\n\nBut the actual count for each phenotypic class is calculated by multiplying the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: (probability of cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain red: (probability of Cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain brown: (probability of Cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nSumming these percentages: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25, which is less than 100. This discrepancy arises because the Punnett square includes all possible combinations, including those that may overlap in phenotype classes due to dominance. However, in reality, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1 based on independent assortment and dominance rules.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the options, none of them perfectly match the 1:2:2:4 ratio, but option G has 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that's a different ratio. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 and is a 3:1:3:1 ratio. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is 16, but the ratio is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me consider that the F2 generation is derived from the F1, who are all CcBb. So, when F1 selfs, the F2 will include all possible genotypes from the F1 parents, which are themselves heterozygous. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nMultiplying these together, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to approximately 6.25:12.5:12.5:25 for each phenotype.\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 and suggests that some phenotypes are missing. Perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the genetic ratios and focus on the possible phenotypes based on the F1, which is CcBb, leading to certain phenotypes. In F1, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (Checkered + Brown)\n- Ccbb: Checkered brown (Checkered + brown)\n- ccBB: Plain brown (Checkered + brown)\n- ccbb: Checkered red (Checkered + red)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. For each gene:\n\n- C: presence (red)\n- b: absence (checkered)\n- B: presence (brown)\n- b: absence (brown)\n\nThus, the F1 (CcBb) will express:\n\n- Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- Checkered brown (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered red (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The F1 is CcBb, so it's a heterozygote for both genes. Therefore, it will exhibit the dominant traits for both genes. So:\n\n- C present \u2192 red (dominant)\n- B present \u2192 brown (dominant)\n  \nThus, all F1 individuals will be Checkered Brown (C present, B present).\n\nThen, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have various combinations, but the key point is that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options don't reflect this precisely. Looking back, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. If we scale down by dividing each by 8, we get 1.5:0.25:0.25:0, which doesn't match. Option E scales by 16: 3,9,1,3 sums to 16, but that's 3:9:3:1, which is a different ratio.\n\nOption D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, and the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is 1:2:2:4 scaled by 4. Wait, no, 1:3:9:3 is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio altogether. It's a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is a different distribution.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer should be the one that reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Among the options, none perfectly match this, but option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 and is a 3:1:3:1 ratio. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that only the F2 generation after F1 selfing is considered, and thus the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 1:2:2:4 when scaled appropriately. Among the options, none exactly match 1:2:2:4, but option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the expected ratio. However, given the options, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but represents 12:2:2:0, which could be a simplified version of the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumption. If the F2 generation is from the F1 (CcBb), which are all CcBb, then the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with another CcBb, the F2 will have various combinations. Let me recast it properly:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nMultiplying these, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n4. Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate because each F2 individual will have a genotype, which determines the phenotype. For example, CC_BB would be Checkered Brown, while CC_bb would be Checkered Red, etc. So the actual phenotypic ratio is determined by the proportion of each genotype.\n\nThe actual counts are as follows:\n\n- CC_BB: 25% (1/4)\n- CC_bb: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc_BB: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc_bb: 25% (1/4)\n\nBut within these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, that's confusing. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles leads to dominant phenotypes. So:\n\n- For C: presence (red) regardless of B\n- For B: presence (brown) regardless of C\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether C and/or B are present:\n\n- Both present \u2192 Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Red (C_bb)\n- C present, B present \u2192 Checkered Brown (CC_B_)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Checkered Brown (cc_BB)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the presence of C affects the phenotype. Let me clarify:\n\nThe presence of the dominant allele for either gene leads to the respective color or presence. So:\n\n- If C is present (dominant), the animal is red.\n- If B is present (dominant), the animal is brown.\n- Thus, if an animal has both C and B present, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If an animal has C present but B absent, it's Checkered Red.\n- If an animal has C absent but B present, it's Checkered Brown (because B is present).\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's plain.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the presence of C makes it red, and the presence of B makes it brown. So:\n\n- If C is present (regardless of B): red\n- If B is present (regardless of C): brown\n- So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. At least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Checkered Brown (both present)\n2. At least one dominant C but no dominant B \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n3. No dominant C but at least one dominant B \u2192 Checkered Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Neither dominant C nor dominant B \u2192 Plain\n\nNow",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are three phenotypes, but in reality, the combination depends on both genes. Alternatively, since each gene contributes to the phenotype, the total number of phenotypic categories is 3 x 3 = 9. But in our case, the phenotypes are combinations of C/B presence. Let's list them:\n\n1. Checkered red (C=not present, B=not present)\n2. Checkered brown (C not present, B present)\n3. Plain red (C present, B not present)\n4. Plain brown (C present, B present)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to specific genotypes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 population. Since each gene is controlled by a single locus with dominance, and the parents are homozygous for each trait, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, but let's confirm that. Using a Punnett square approach:\n\nFor gene C:\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) : 25%\n- Heterozygous (Cc) : 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) : 25%\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) : 25%\n- Heterozygous (Bb) : 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) : 25%\n\nBut since the two genes are linked (as indicated by the different letters used for each gene), their inheritance might not be independent. However, the problem doesn't specify any linkage among the genes, so we'll assume they assort independently. Therefore, the combined phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but how does that translate into the actual phenotypic counts?\n\nLet's consider each combination:\n\n- Checkered red (C absent, B absent): This occurs when both genes are recessive. The probability is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/100 = 6.25/100 = 1/16. So 1/16 of the population.\n- Checkered brown (C absent, B present): Probability is (prob cc) * (prob Bb) = 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 1/8.\n- Plain red (C present, B absent): (prob Cc) * (prob bb) = 50% * 25% = 12.5% \u2192 1/8.\n- Plain brown (C present, B present): (prob Cc) * (prob Bb) = 50% * 50% = 25% \u2192 1/4.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 6.25:12.5:12.5:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:4 when multiplied by 16. So 1 part, 2 parts, 2 parts, 4 parts.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option D states: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches the 1:2:2:4 ratio if scaled appropriately. Because 1+2+2+4=9, but the exact pheno ratios are 1:2:2:4. So option D is 1:3:9:3, which seems off. Wait, no, my earlier calculation shows 1:2:2:4, which isn't exactly matching any of the options except perhaps none of them match, but looking back, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the ratio is 3:9:3:1, which is a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which isn't what we have here. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question refers to the F2 generation without considering the actual diploid formation, but perhaps I got confused with the number of generations. Let me try again.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are:\n\n- CcBb: red, brown (Checkered)\n- Ccbb: red, brown (Plain)\n- ccBB: plain, brown (Red)\n- ccbb: plain, brown (Checkered)\n\nCalculating the frequencies:\n\n- CcBb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Ccbb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- ccBB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- ccbb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is 6.25% Checkered red, 12.5% Checkered brown, 12.5% Plain red, 25% Plain brown. Multiplying by 100 gives 6.25:12.5:12.5:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:4 when divided by 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 1:2:2:4, but option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because the sum of these is 16, but according to our calculations, it's 9. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is 16, but our numbers are 1:2:2:4, so scaling up by 6.25 gives us 6.25:12.5:12.5:25. None of the options perfectly match this, but option E says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 and is a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our 1:2:2:4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the genetic ratios and look at the possible phenotypes based on the F1 being CcBb, but then the F2 would be a mix of F1 and F2, leading to a different approach. But I think the intended method is to use the standard dihybrid cross where the F2 ratio follows 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven the options, option D seems to have the correct proportions: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that adds up to 16, but according to our calculation, it's 6.25:12.5:12.5:25, which is roughly 1:2:2:4. However, none of the options perfectly match this, but option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't add up. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 16, but that's a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me recount. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 population has 9 possible combinations based on the independent assortment. Each phenotypic category is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. The phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But when calculating the actual number of individuals, we have to consider the actual probabilities. So the actual counts are based on the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nIn our case, the probabilities are:\n\n- C present (red): 75% (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%). Wait, no, that's incorrect. The presence of C is always red unless cc. So the chance of having red (either presence or absence of C) is 75% for the C locus. Similarly for B.\n\nBut the actual count for each phenotypic class is calculated by multiplying the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: (probability of cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain red: (probability of Cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain brown: (probability of Cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nSumming these percentages: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25, which is less than 100. This discrepancy arises because the Punnett square includes all possible combinations, including those that may overlap in phenotype classes due to dominance. However, in reality, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1 based on independent assortment and dominance rules.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the options, none of them perfectly match the 1:2:2:4 ratio, but option G has 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that's a different ratio. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 and is a 3:1:3:1 ratio. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is 16, but the ratio is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me consider that the F2 generation is derived from the F1, who are all CcBb. So, when F1 selfs, the F2 will include all possible genotypes from the F1 parents, which are themselves heterozygous. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nMultiplying these together, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to approximately 6.25:12.5:12.5:25 for each phenotype.\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 and suggests that some phenotypes are missing. Perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the genetic ratios and focus on the possible phenotypes based on the F1, which is CcBb, leading to certain phenotypes. In F1, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (Checkered + Brown)\n- Ccbb: Checkered brown (Checkered + brown)\n- ccBB: Plain brown (Checkered + brown)\n- ccbb: Checkered red (Checkered + red)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. For each gene:\n\n- C: presence (red)\n- b: absence (checkered)\n- B: presence (brown)\n- b: absence (brown)\n\nThus, the F1 (CcBb) will express:\n\n- Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n- Checkered brown (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered red (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The F1 is CcBb, so it's a heterozygote for both genes. Therefore, it will exhibit the dominant traits for both genes. So:\n\n- C present \u2192 red (dominant)\n- B present \u2192 brown (dominant)\n  \nThus, all F1 individuals will be Checkered Brown (C present, B present).\n\nThen, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have various combinations, but the key point is that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options don't reflect this precisely. Looking back, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. If we scale down by dividing each by 8, we get 1.5:0.25:0.25:0, which doesn't match. Option E scales by 16: 3,9,1,3 sums to 16, but that's 3:9:3:1, which is a different ratio.\n\nOption D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, and the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is 1:2:2:4 scaled by 4. Wait, no, 1:3:9:3 is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio altogether. It's a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is a different distribution.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer should be the one that reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Among the options, none perfectly match this, but option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 and is a 3:1:3:1 ratio. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that only the F2 generation after F1 selfing is considered, and thus the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 1:2:2:4 when scaled appropriately. Among the options, none exactly match 1:2:2:4, but option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the expected ratio. However, given the options, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but represents 12:2:2:0, which could be a simplified version of the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumption. If the F2 generation is from the F1 (CcBb), which are all CcBb, then the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with another CcBb, the F2 will have various combinations. Let me recast it properly:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nMultiplying these, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n4. Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate because each F2 individual will have a genotype, which determines the phenotype. For example, CC_BB would be Checkered Brown, while CC_bb would be Checkered Red, etc. So the actual phenotypic ratio is determined by the proportion of each genotype.\n\nThe actual counts are as follows:\n\n- CC_BB: 25% (1/4)\n- CC_bb: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc_BB: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc_bb: 25% (1/4)\n\nBut within these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B present)\n\nWait, that's confusing. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles leads to dominant phenotypes. So:\n\n- For C: presence (red) regardless of B\n- For B: presence (brown) regardless of C\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether C and/or B are present:\n\n- Both present \u2192 Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Red (C_bb)\n- C present, B present \u2192 Checkered Brown (CC_B_)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Checkered Brown (cc_BB)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the presence of C affects the phenotype. Let me clarify:\n\nThe presence of the dominant allele for either gene leads to the respective color or presence. So:\n\n- If C is present (dominant), the animal is red.\n- If B is present (dominant), the animal is brown.\n- Thus, if an animal has both C and B present, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If an animal has C present but B absent, it's Checkered Red.\n- If an animal has C absent but B present, it's Checkered Brown (because B is present).\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's plain.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the presence of C makes it red, and the presence of B makes it brown. So:\n\n- If C is present (regardless of B): red\n- If B is present (regardless of C): brown\n- So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. At least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Checkered Brown (both present)\n2. At least one dominant C but no dominant B \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B absent)\n3. No dominant C but at least one dominant B \u2192 Checkered Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Neither dominant C nor dominant B \u2192 Plain\n\nNow",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities, leading to four combinations (since two genes are involved).",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo for each gene, there are two possibilities, leading to four combinations (since two genes are involved). But for phenotypes, each combination leads to a specific phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. C is present, B is present: red brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C is present, B is absent: red checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. C is absent, B is present: plain brown \u2192 brown\n4. C is absent, B is absent: plain plain \u2192 checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's mixing up the terms. Let me clarify: For the C locus, presence is dominant (red), absence is plain. Similarly for B: presence is brown, absence is checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these. So each gene contributes a factor:\n\n- C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)\n\nEach combination results in a unique phenotype. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in F2.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of being present (dominant) is 3/4 (because each parent contributes a dominant allele, leading to a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele). Similarly, the probability of being absent (recessive) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C dominant, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)= 3/16\n3. C absent, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)= 3/16\n4. Both absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Plain brown : Checkered brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options, H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014which doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014nope. Wait, none seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check. The question states:\n\n- Pigmentation: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele for either gene, they exhibit the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, they have a certain phenotype. Wait, no\u2014it depends on both genes. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. So:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- If C is present (at least one dominant C allele), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (at least one recessive c allele), the bird is plain.\n\nSimilarly for color (B):\n\n- If B is present (at least one dominant B allele), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (at least one recessive b allele), the bird is checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether both genes are present (i.e., at least one dominant allele for each gene).\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele exists for each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (even if c is present), then the bird is red.\n- If B is present (even if b is present), then the bird is brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (both c and b), then the bird is plain brown (for C) and checkered (for B). Wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, then it's plain brown (for C) and checkered (for B)? That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the phenotype is determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present for each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C): if at least one C allele is present, the bird is red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- For color (B): if at least one B allele is present, the bird is brown. Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes. A bird will have a particular phenotype if it satisfies both conditions:\n\n- Has at least one C allele (red)\n- Has at least one B allele (brown)\n\nIf either condition is met, it shows the corresponding phenotype. Wait, no\u2014that's not how dominance works. Each gene acts independently. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it's red, regardless of the B allele.\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown, regardless of the C allele.\n- If it has neither, it's the combination of both, i.e., plain brown (no C) and checkered (no B), which would make it plain brown and checkered together\u2014wait, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each gene's effect separately. So:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n1. Pigmentation (C):\n   - Dominant C \u2192 red\n   - Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\n2. Color (B):\n   - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n   - Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nThe overall phenotype is determined by both traits. So, a bird will display the phenotype where both traits are expressed. That is:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it will have a red-brown checkered bird (but according to the options, maybe it's plain red or something else).\nWait, perhaps the way the problem describes the phenotypes is that each trait is additive. So, for example, if the bird has a dominant C, it's red. And if it has a dominant B, it's brown. Therefore, the combination could lead to different phenotypes:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered red (as both traits are present)\n- Dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Plain red (only pigment is red)\n- Recessive C and dominant B \u2192 Plain brown (only color is brown)\n- Recessive C and recessive B \u2192 Checkered brown (both traits are not present)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So now, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nIn F2, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio for presence or absence of dominant alleles. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes' ratios are the product of the individual ratios.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both dominant. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Plain red: Only dominant C, recessive B. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain brown: Only dominant B, recessive C. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Checkered brown: Neither dominant C nor B. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which equals 1. So the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align with my calculations. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also not matching. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Hmm, none seem to fit exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach parent is CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 25% for each combination: CC, Cc, cb, bb.\n\nNow, for each F2 genotype, what's the phenotype?\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant, so Checkered red\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB: C present, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: C present, b \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb BB: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb Bb: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb bb: c recessive, b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's apply the dominance rules properly.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Any C \u2192 red\n- Any c \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- Any B \u2192 brown\n- Any b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for each genotype, determine if both traits are present.\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: C dominant, b \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB: C dominant, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C dominant, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: C dominant, b \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb BB: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb Bb: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb bb: c recessive, b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 instances\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Checkered brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb, cb BB, cb Bb \u2192 4 instances\n- Plain red: Cc bb, cb bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that adds up to 12 (4+2+4+2=12). But the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (4x4 grid). So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 6\n\nWait, no, that's 4+2+4+6=16, which fits. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:4:6, which simplifies to 2:1:2:3 when divided by 2. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this.\n\nLooking back at the answer options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, but 6 red, 2 red, etc.\u2014doesn't fit\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Sum 16, but 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't fit\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Sum 16, but higher numbers\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All same, which isn't the case\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 This matches our calculation except for the checkered brown and plain red counts, which are 4 and 6 respectively, not 2 and 2. So G is close but not exact.\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Doesn't match\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 Doesn't match\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All same\nL. None\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match my final count of 4 checkered red, 2 plain red, 4 checkered brown, and 6 plain brown. The closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\u2014which doesn't match. Alternatively, option F: 4,4,4,4, which is incorrect. Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2192No. Option D: 1,3,9,3\u2192No. Option G is close but off by factors of 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014in fact, the F1 is CcBb, which produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB gamete + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cb BB: Plain brown\n- cb Bb: Plain brown\n- cb bb: Checkered brown\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 instances (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 2 instances (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 4 instances (Cc BB, Cc Bb, cb BB, cb Bb)\n- Plain red: 6 instances (Cc bb, cb bb)\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:4:6, which simplifies to 2:1:2:3. Looking at the options, none exactly match this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is too high for the red phenotypes. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is wrong. Option K is 4:4:4:4, same issue. Option J is 2:6:3:1\u2192No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again:\n\n- Checkered red: All F2 with at least one dominant C \u2192 How many?\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- Cc BB: Yes\n- Cc Bb: Yes\nThat's 4\n- Plain brown: bb genotype \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: Only when both C and B are recessive \u2192 bb genotype \u2192 2\n- Plain red: Only when both C and B are recessive \u2192 bb genotype \u2192 2\n\nWait, but that sums to 4+2+2+2=10, which is less than 16. Something's wrong here. Wait, no\u2014it should sum to 16. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\n- Cc Bb: 1 \u2192 Total 4\n- bb: 2 (from bb and cc)\n- Cc BB: already counted\n- Cc Bb: already counted\n- Cc bb: 1\n- cb BB: 1\n- cb Bb: 1\n- cb bb: 1\n\nWait, that's getting confusing. Let me use a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype Frequency\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\nPlain brown | CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\nCheckered brown | Cc BB, Cc Bb, cb BB, cb Bb \u2192 4\nPlain red | Cc bb, cb bb \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 4+2+4+2=12. Wait, that's 12, but I thought it was 16. Where am I missing 4?\n\nAh, I forgot that some genotypes might not be possible. Wait, no\u2014each F2 generation is 4x4=16. Earlier, I listed 4+2+4+6=16, but that was incorrect. Actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 6\n\nBecause 4+2+4+6=16. So the correct ratio is 4:2:4:6, which simplifies to 2:1:2:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests 12 checkered red and 2 plain red, but according to our calculation, it's 4 and 6. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2192No. Option I is 7,5,1,3\u2192No.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and look purely at the presence of dominant alleles without considering the actual colors. In that case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, ignoring the color components. So, for pigment:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\nAnd for color:\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype would be determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present in each gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one C and at least one B\n- Plain red: At least one C, no B\n- Checkered brown: No C, at least one B\n- Plain brown: No C, no B\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for each gene, there are two possibilities, leading to four combinations (since two genes are involved). But for phenotypes, each combination leads to a specific phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. C is present, B is present: red brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C is present, B is absent: red checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. C is absent, B is present: plain brown \u2192 brown\n4. C is absent, B is absent: plain plain \u2192 checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's mixing up the terms. Let me clarify: For the C locus, presence is dominant (red), absence is plain. Similarly for B: presence is brown, absence is checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these. So each gene contributes a factor:\n\n- C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)\n\nEach combination results in a unique phenotype. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in F2.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of being present (dominant) is 3/4 (because each parent contributes a dominant allele, leading to a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele). Similarly, the probability of being absent (recessive) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C dominant, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)= 3/16\n3. C absent, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)= 3/16\n4. Both absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Plain brown : Checkered brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options, H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014which doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014nope. Wait, none seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check. The question states:\n\n- Pigmentation: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele for either gene, they exhibit the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, they have a certain phenotype. Wait, no\u2014it depends on both genes. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. So:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- If C is present (at least one dominant C allele), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (at least one recessive c allele), the bird is plain.\n\nSimilarly for color (B):\n\n- If B is present (at least one dominant B allele), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (at least one recessive b allele), the bird is checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether both genes are present (i.e., at least one dominant allele for each gene).\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele exists for each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (even if c is present), then the bird is red.\n- If B is present (even if b is present), then the bird is brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (both c and b), then the bird is plain brown (for C) and checkered (for B). Wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, then it's plain brown (for C) and checkered (for B)? That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the phenotype is determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present for each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C): if at least one C allele is present, the bird is red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- For color (B): if at least one B allele is present, the bird is brown. Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes. A bird will have a particular phenotype if it satisfies both conditions:\n\n- Has at least one C allele (red)\n- Has at least one B allele (brown)\n\nIf either condition is met, it shows the corresponding phenotype. Wait, no\u2014that's not how dominance works. Each gene acts independently. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it's red, regardless of the B allele.\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown, regardless of the C allele.\n- If it has neither, it's the combination of both, i.e., plain brown (no C) and checkered (no B), which would make it plain brown and checkered together\u2014wait, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each gene's effect separately. So:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n1. Pigmentation (C):\n   - Dominant C \u2192 red\n   - Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\n2. Color (B):\n   - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n   - Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nThe overall phenotype is determined by both traits. So, a bird will display the phenotype where both traits are expressed. That is:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it will have a red-brown checkered bird (but according to the options, maybe it's plain red or something else).\nWait, perhaps the way the problem describes the phenotypes is that each trait is additive. So, for example, if the bird has a dominant C, it's red. And if it has a dominant B, it's brown. Therefore, the combination could lead to different phenotypes:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered red (as both traits are present)\n- Dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Plain red (only pigment is red)\n- Recessive C and dominant B \u2192 Plain brown (only color is brown)\n- Recessive C and recessive B \u2192 Checkered brown (both traits are not present)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So now, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nIn F2, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio for presence or absence of dominant alleles. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes' ratios are the product of the individual ratios.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both dominant. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Plain red: Only dominant C, recessive B. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain brown: Only dominant B, recessive C. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Checkered brown: Neither dominant C nor B. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which equals 1. So the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align with my calculations. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also not matching. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Hmm, none seem to fit exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach parent is CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 25% for each combination: CC, Cc, cb, bb.\n\nNow, for each F2 genotype, what's the phenotype?\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant, so Checkered red\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB: C present, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: C present, b \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb BB: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb Bb: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb bb: c recessive, b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's apply the dominance rules properly.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Any C \u2192 red\n- Any c \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- Any B \u2192 brown\n- Any b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for each genotype, determine if both traits are present.\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: C dominant, b \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB: C dominant, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C dominant, B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: C dominant, b \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb BB: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb Bb: c recessive, B \u2192 Plain brown\n- cb bb: c recessive, b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 instances\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Checkered brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb, cb BB, cb Bb \u2192 4 instances\n- Plain red: Cc bb, cb bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that adds up to 12 (4+2+4+2=12). But the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (4x4 grid). So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 6\n\nWait, no, that's 4+2+4+6=16, which fits. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:4:6, which simplifies to 2:1:2:3 when divided by 2. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this.\n\nLooking back at the answer options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, but 6 red, 2 red, etc.\u2014doesn't fit\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Sum 16, but 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't fit\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Sum 16, but higher numbers\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All same, which isn't the case\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 This matches our calculation except for the checkered brown and plain red counts, which are 4 and 6 respectively, not 2 and 2. So G is close but not exact.\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Doesn't match\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 Doesn't match\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All same\nL. None\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match my final count of 4 checkered red, 2 plain red, 4 checkered brown, and 6 plain brown. The closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\u2014which doesn't match. Alternatively, option F: 4,4,4,4, which is incorrect. Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2192No. Option D: 1,3,9,3\u2192No. Option G is close but off by factors of 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014in fact, the F1 is CcBb, which produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB gamete + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cb BB: Plain brown\n- cb Bb: Plain brown\n- cb bb: Checkered brown\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 instances (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 2 instances (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 4 instances (Cc BB, Cc Bb, cb BB, cb Bb)\n- Plain red: 6 instances (Cc bb, cb bb)\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:4:6, which simplifies to 2:1:2:3. Looking at the options, none exactly match this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is too high for the red phenotypes. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is wrong. Option K is 4:4:4:4, same issue. Option J is 2:6:3:1\u2192No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again:\n\n- Checkered red: All F2 with at least one dominant C \u2192 How many?\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- Cc BB: Yes\n- Cc Bb: Yes\nThat's 4\n- Plain brown: bb genotype \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: Only when both C and B are recessive \u2192 bb genotype \u2192 2\n- Plain red: Only when both C and B are recessive \u2192 bb genotype \u2192 2\n\nWait, but that sums to 4+2+2+2=10, which is less than 16. Something's wrong here. Wait, no\u2014it should sum to 16. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\n- Cc Bb: 1 \u2192 Total 4\n- bb: 2 (from bb and cc)\n- Cc BB: already counted\n- Cc Bb: already counted\n- Cc bb: 1\n- cb BB: 1\n- cb Bb: 1\n- cb bb: 1\n\nWait, that's getting confusing. Let me use a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype Frequency\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\nPlain brown | CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\nCheckered brown | Cc BB, Cc Bb, cb BB, cb Bb \u2192 4\nPlain red | Cc bb, cb bb \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 4+2+4+2=12. Wait, that's 12, but I thought it was 16. Where am I missing 4?\n\nAh, I forgot that some genotypes might not be possible. Wait, no\u2014each F2 generation is 4x4=16. Earlier, I listed 4+2+4+6=16, but that was incorrect. Actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 6\n\nBecause 4+2+4+6=16. So the correct ratio is 4:2:4:6, which simplifies to 2:1:2:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests 12 checkered red and 2 plain red, but according to our calculation, it's 4 and 6. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2192No. Option I is 7,5,1,3\u2192No.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and look purely at the presence of dominant alleles without considering the actual colors. In that case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, ignoring the color components. So, for pigment:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\nAnd for color:\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype would be determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present in each gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one C and at least one B\n- Plain red: At least one C, no B\n- Checkered brown: No C, at least one B\n- Plain brown: No C, no B\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

    "rollout": " \n\nSo for the C locus, the phenotypes are red (C) and plain (c). For the B locus, they are brown (B) and checkered (b).\n\nNow, the F2 individuals will express the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we'll consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. If both C and B are dominant (C and B present), the phenotype is red-brown.\n2. If C is dominant (red) and B is recessive (checkered), the phenotype is red-checkered.\n3. If C is recessive (plain) and B is dominant (brown), the phenotype is plain-brown.\n4. If both C and B are recessive (plain and checkered), the phenotype is plain-checkered.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, while plain color is recessive. Similarly, brown is dominant B, checkered recessive b. So the checkered pattern is dominant, but the color depends on B. Wait, the problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant C\n- Plain color: recessive c\n- Red color: dominant B\n- Brown color: recessive b\n\nWait, that's conflicting because if C is dominant, then plain is recessive, so checkered is C, and plain is c. Similarly, B is dominant, so brown is B, and checkered is b. So the presence of C (dominant) leads to checkered, and the presence of b leads to plain. Similarly, B (dominant) leads to brown, and b leads to checkered.\n\nTherefore, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant B allele (since B is dominant over b), and also at least one dominant C allele (since C is dominant over c). So the only way to be red is if both B and C are present.\n\nSimilarly, to be brown, the bird must have at least one dominant B allele (so B is present) but must be plain (no C), i.e., c alleles. To be checkered, the bird must be plain (no C) but may have either B or c, depending on whether B is present. Wait, but the problem defines the checkered as recessive C (i.e., c) and brown as recessive B (i.e., b). Hmm, maybe I got it reversed earlier.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color: checkered (C) or plain (c)\n- B is dominant for color: brown (B) or checkered (b)\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): phenotype is c b = checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same as above.\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\nRed color is controlled by B, which is dominant, and brown by b, recessive. Checkered by C, dominant, and plain by c, recessive.\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- Red: at least one B (dominant) and at least one C (dominant). Because C is dominant, having any C allele results in checkered. B being dominant allows brown. So to be red, the bird must have B (at least one) and C (at least one).\n- Brown: at least one B (dominant) and no C (so c alleles). Because if there's a B, even without C, it's brown.\n- Checkered: at least one C (so c alleles) and no B (so b alleles). So the bird has plain (no B) and checkered (has C).\n- Checkered-brown: no C (all c) and no B (all b). Wait, no\u2014if C is recessive (c), then the bird is plain, and if B is recessive (b), then the bird is checkered. So checkered-brown would be plain and checkered, which is c b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a table for each bird type.\n\nBird Type | Presence of C | Presence of B | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered (c) | Present (C) | Present (B) | c b = checkered-brown\nPlain (c) | Present (C) | Absent (B) | c b = checkered-brown\nBrown (b) | Absent (C) | Present (B) | b B = brown\nCheckered (c) | Absent (C) | Absent (B) | c b = checkered-brown\nWait, this doesn't seem right. Maybe better to approach it differently.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for C and two for B. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant, so presence of C \u2192 checkered (any C present)\n- c \u2192 plain (no C)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B is dominant, so presence of B \u2192 brown (any B present)\n- b \u2192 checkered (no B)\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n- To be red: must have B (dominant) and C (dominant). So at least one B and at least one C.\n- To be brown: must have B (dominant) but no C (so c for C, and B present). So B is present, C absent.\n- To be checkered: must be plain (no C) but can have B or c. So C absent, B present or absent.\n- To be checkered-brown: plain (no C) and brown (no B). So C and B are absent.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, checkered is when C is dominant, regardless of B. Brown is when B is dominant, regardless of C. So:\n\n- Checkered-brown: no C and no B \u2192 c b\n- Checkered (plain) with brown: no C, but B \u2192 c b\n- Checkered with plain: no C, no B \u2192 c b\n- Plain with brown: no C, B \u2192 c b\n- Plain with checkered: no C, no B \u2192 c b\n- Brown with checkered: no C, B \u2192 c b\n- Brown with brown: no C, B \u2192 brown\n- Checkered with brown: no C, B \u2192 brown\n- Checkered with checkered: no C, B \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but this seems too broad. Perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might state that:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C present \u2192 checkered\n  - c \u2192 plain\n- Color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these two traits.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): checkered-brown\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): checkered-brown\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): same as above\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): same as above\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): same\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): same\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B): brown\n- If C is absent (c) and B is absent (b): checkered\n\nWait, now I see. This makes more sense. So each trait is evaluated separately, and the phenotype is the combination.\n\nSo, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C=Yes, B=Yes \u2192 checkered-brown\n2. C=Yes, B=No \u2192 checkered-brown\n3. C=No, B=Yes \u2192 brown\n4. C=No, B=No \u2192 checkered\n\nAdditionally, since both genes are acting independently, the Punnett square for the F2 would involve each parent producing gametes based on their genotypes. Given that the F1 is CcBb, each parent will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But wait, since the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes, the gametes will be half CB and half cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for one gene. For two genes, it's different. Each gene is independent, so the F2 will have four possible combinations for each gene.\n\nThe F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- Both C and B are present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only C present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only B present \u2192 brown\n- Neither present \u2192 checkered\n\nBut wait, according to the problem, the checkered pattern is determined by C, and the color by B. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): c b\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same as above\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me try a different approach. Each bird will have two alleles for C and two for B. The F2 genotypes will be determined by the gametes from F1.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb, it can produce gametes in a 2:2 ratio (or 50% CB and 50% cb) for each gene.\n\nThus, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall F2 genotypes are all combinations of these. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: checkered (C is present)\n  - BB: brown (B is present)\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered (c)\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Cc: checkered (C)\n  - BB: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c)\n  - BB: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c)\n  - BB: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, that suggests that all F2 are checkered-brown. That can't be right. I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Because the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the genotype. So:\n\n- A bird is checkered (C) if it has at least one C allele.\n- A bird is brown (B) if it has at least one B allele.\n- Checkered-brown would occur when the bird has both C and B alleles (i.e., at least one C and at least one B).\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- Any bird with at least one C and at least one B is checkered-brown.\n- Birds with at least one C and no B are checkered-brown.\n- Birds with at least one B and no C are brown.\n- Birds with neither C nor B are checkered.\n\nWait, but how does this happen?\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Cc: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n\nWait, that still suggests that all F2 have at least one checkered allele, leading them to be checkered-brown. That doesn't make sense because some would have only C, others only B, and some none.\n\nAh, I think I messed up the analysis. Let me think again.\n\nThe F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Cc: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n\nWait, that still leads to all being checkered-brown, which contradicts expectations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance is such that C is dominant for pigment, but b is recessive for color. Similarly, B is dominant for color, but c is recessive for pigment. So:\n\n- To be red: must have B (dominant) and C (dominant). So at least one B and at least one C.\n- To be brown: must have B (dominant) but no C (so c for C and B present). So B is present, C is absent.\n- To be checkered: must be plain (no C) but may have B or c. So C is absent, B present or absent.\n- To be checkered-brown: plain (no C) and brown (no B). So C and B are absent.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) and plain (c): phenotype is checkered-brown?\nWait, no. Checkered is when C is absent, regardless of B. Brown is when B is absent, regardless of C.\n\nWait, I think I confused myself. Let me create a table:\n\n| Bird Type | C Alleles | B Alleles | Phenotype |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Checkered-Brown (C present, B present) | Yes | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered-Brown (C present, B absent) | Yes | No | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered-Brown (C absent, B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered-Brown (C absent, B absent) | No | No | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B absent) | No | No | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: checkered-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent: checkered-brown\n- If C is absent and B is present: brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent: checkered-brown\n\nWait, but that suggests that all birds with at least one C and/or B are checkered-brown except those with no C and no B. Which isn't accurate.\n\nPerhaps I should re-express it as:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C is absent\n  - Brown (b) \u2192 B is absent \u2192 phenotype is checkered-brown\n  - Checkered (b) \u2192 B is present \u2192 phenotype is checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C is absent, B present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C absent, B absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C absent, B absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the key is to recognize that the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If the bird has at least one C and no B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If the bird has no C and at least one B \u2192 brown\n- If the bird has no C and no B \u2192 checkered\n\nBut that can't be right because some birds would have only C or only B. For example:\n\n- C present (C), B absent (b) \u2192 checkered-brown\n- C absent (c), B present (B) \u2192 brown\n- C absent (c), B absent (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, checkered is when C is dominant, regardless of B. And brown is when B is dominant, regardless of C. So, the phenotype combines both traits:\n\n- Both traits are present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only one trait is present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Neither trait is present \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with reality. Actually, I think the correct way is:\n\n- Checkered (C) \u2192 presence of C allele\n- Brown (B) \u2192 presence of B allele\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits:\n\n- Both present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only one present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Neither present \u2192 checkered\n\nBecause, for example, a bird that is checkered (C present) but not brown (B absent) would have phenotype checkered-brown. Wait, no, if B is absent, the bird is brown. So:\n\n- Checkered (C) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (C) and not brown (B absent) \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Not checkered (C absent) and brown (B present) \u2192 brown\n- Not checkered (C absent) and not brown (B absent) \u2192 checkered\n\nThis makes sense because:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- All birds where C is present \u2192 checkered-brown (regardless of B)\n- All birds where B is present \u2192 brown\n- All birds where neither C nor B are present \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but that can't be right because some birds could have both C and B, and others not.\n\nActually, the correct",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for the C locus, the phenotypes are red (C) and plain (c). For the B locus, they are brown (B) and checkered (b).\n\nNow, the F2 individuals will express the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we'll consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. If both C and B are dominant (C and B present), the phenotype is red-brown.\n2. If C is dominant (red) and B is recessive (checkered), the phenotype is red-checkered.\n3. If C is recessive (plain) and B is dominant (brown), the phenotype is plain-brown.\n4. If both C and B are recessive (plain and checkered), the phenotype is plain-checkered.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, while plain color is recessive. Similarly, brown is dominant B, checkered recessive b. So the checkered pattern is dominant, but the color depends on B. Wait, the problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant C\n- Plain color: recessive c\n- Red color: dominant B\n- Brown color: recessive b\n\nWait, that's conflicting because if C is dominant, then plain is recessive, so checkered is C, and plain is c. Similarly, B is dominant, so brown is B, and checkered is b. So the presence of C (dominant) leads to checkered, and the presence of b leads to plain. Similarly, B (dominant) leads to brown, and b leads to checkered.\n\nTherefore, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant B allele (since B is dominant over b), and also at least one dominant C allele (since C is dominant over c). So the only way to be red is if both B and C are present.\n\nSimilarly, to be brown, the bird must have at least one dominant B allele (so B is present) but must be plain (no C), i.e., c alleles. To be checkered, the bird must be plain (no C) but may have either B or c, depending on whether B is present. Wait, but the problem defines the checkered as recessive C (i.e., c) and brown as recessive B (i.e., b). Hmm, maybe I got it reversed earlier.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color: checkered (C) or plain (c)\n- B is dominant for color: brown (B) or checkered (b)\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): phenotype is c b = checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same as above.\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\nRed color is controlled by B, which is dominant, and brown by b, recessive. Checkered by C, dominant, and plain by c, recessive.\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- Red: at least one B (dominant) and at least one C (dominant). Because C is dominant, having any C allele results in checkered. B being dominant allows brown. So to be red, the bird must have B (at least one) and C (at least one).\n- Brown: at least one B (dominant) and no C (so c alleles). Because if there's a B, even without C, it's brown.\n- Checkered: at least one C (so c alleles) and no B (so b alleles). So the bird has plain (no B) and checkered (has C).\n- Checkered-brown: no C (all c) and no B (all b). Wait, no\u2014if C is recessive (c), then the bird is plain, and if B is recessive (b), then the bird is checkered. So checkered-brown would be plain and checkered, which is c b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a table for each bird type.\n\nBird Type | Presence of C | Presence of B | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered (c) | Present (C) | Present (B) | c b = checkered-brown\nPlain (c) | Present (C) | Absent (B) | c b = checkered-brown\nBrown (b) | Absent (C) | Present (B) | b B = brown\nCheckered (c) | Absent (C) | Absent (B) | c b = checkered-brown\nWait, this doesn't seem right. Maybe better to approach it differently.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for C and two for B. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant, so presence of C \u2192 checkered (any C present)\n- c \u2192 plain (no C)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B is dominant, so presence of B \u2192 brown (any B present)\n- b \u2192 checkered (no B)\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n- To be red: must have B (dominant) and C (dominant). So at least one B and at least one C.\n- To be brown: must have B (dominant) but no C (so c for C, and B present). So B is present, C absent.\n- To be checkered: must be plain (no C) but can have B or c. So C absent, B present or absent.\n- To be checkered-brown: plain (no C) and brown (no B). So C and B are absent.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, checkered is when C is dominant, regardless of B. Brown is when B is dominant, regardless of C. So:\n\n- Checkered-brown: no C and no B \u2192 c b\n- Checkered (plain) with brown: no C, but B \u2192 c b\n- Checkered with plain: no C, no B \u2192 c b\n- Plain with brown: no C, B \u2192 c b\n- Plain with checkered: no C, no B \u2192 c b\n- Brown with checkered: no C, B \u2192 c b\n- Brown with brown: no C, B \u2192 brown\n- Checkered with brown: no C, B \u2192 brown\n- Checkered with checkered: no C, B \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but this seems too broad. Perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might state that:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C present \u2192 checkered\n  - c \u2192 plain\n- Color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these two traits.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): checkered-brown\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): checkered-brown\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): same as above\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): same as above\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): same\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): same\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B): brown\n- If C is absent (c) and B is absent (b): checkered\n\nWait, now I see. This makes more sense. So each trait is evaluated separately, and the phenotype is the combination.\n\nSo, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C=Yes, B=Yes \u2192 checkered-brown\n2. C=Yes, B=No \u2192 checkered-brown\n3. C=No, B=Yes \u2192 brown\n4. C=No, B=No \u2192 checkered\n\nAdditionally, since both genes are acting independently, the Punnett square for the F2 would involve each parent producing gametes based on their genotypes. Given that the F1 is CcBb, each parent will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But wait, since the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes, the gametes will be half CB and half cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for one gene. For two genes, it's different. Each gene is independent, so the F2 will have four possible combinations for each gene.\n\nThe F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- Both C and B are present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only C present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only B present \u2192 brown\n- Neither present \u2192 checkered\n\nBut wait, according to the problem, the checkered pattern is determined by C, and the color by B. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): c b\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same as above\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n- Checkered (c) and brown (b): same\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me try a different approach. Each bird will have two alleles for C and two for B. The F2 genotypes will be determined by the gametes from F1.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb, it can produce gametes in a 2:2 ratio (or 50% CB and 50% cb) for each gene.\n\nThus, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall F2 genotypes are all combinations of these. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: checkered (C is present)\n  - BB: brown (B is present)\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered (c)\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Cc: checkered (C)\n  - BB: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c)\n  - BB: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c)\n  - BB: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - Bb: brown\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n  - bb: checkered\n    \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, that suggests that all F2 are checkered-brown. That can't be right. I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Because the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the genotype. So:\n\n- A bird is checkered (C) if it has at least one C allele.\n- A bird is brown (B) if it has at least one B allele.\n- Checkered-brown would occur when the bird has both C and B alleles (i.e., at least one C and at least one B).\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- Any bird with at least one C and at least one B is checkered-brown.\n- Birds with at least one C and no B are checkered-brown.\n- Birds with at least one B and no C are brown.\n- Birds with neither C nor B are checkered.\n\nWait, but how does this happen?\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Cc: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n\nWait, that still suggests that all F2 have at least one checkered allele, leading them to be checkered-brown. That doesn't make sense because some would have only C, others only B, and some none.\n\nAh, I think I messed up the analysis. Let me think again.\n\nThe F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Cc: checkered (C), any B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n- cc: plain (c), any B \u2192 brown\n\nWait, that still leads to all being checkered-brown, which contradicts expectations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance is such that C is dominant for pigment, but b is recessive for color. Similarly, B is dominant for color, but c is recessive for pigment. So:\n\n- To be red: must have B (dominant) and C (dominant). So at least one B and at least one C.\n- To be brown: must have B (dominant) but no C (so c for C and B present). So B is present, C is absent.\n- To be checkered: must be plain (no C) but may have B or c. So C is absent, B present or absent.\n- To be checkered-brown: plain (no C) and brown (no B). So C and B are absent.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) and plain (c): phenotype is checkered-brown?\nWait, no. Checkered is when C is absent, regardless of B. Brown is when B is absent, regardless of C.\n\nWait, I think I confused myself. Let me create a table:\n\n| Bird Type | C Alleles | B Alleles | Phenotype |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Checkered-Brown (C present, B present) | Yes | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered-Brown (C present, B absent) | Yes | No | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered-Brown (C absent, B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered-Brown (C absent, B absent) | No | No | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B absent) | No | No | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n| Checkered (C absent) with Brown (B present) | No | Yes | c b \u2192 checkered-brown |\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: checkered-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent: checkered-brown\n- If C is absent and B is present: brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent: checkered-brown\n\nWait, but that suggests that all birds with at least one C and/or B are checkered-brown except those with no C and no B. Which isn't accurate.\n\nPerhaps I should re-express it as:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C is absent\n  - Brown (b) \u2192 B is absent \u2192 phenotype is checkered-brown\n  - Checkered (b) \u2192 B is present \u2192 phenotype is checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C is absent, B present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C absent, B absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 brown\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 C absent, B absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the key is to recognize that the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If the bird has at least one C and no B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If the bird has no C and at least one B \u2192 brown\n- If the bird has no C and no B \u2192 checkered\n\nBut that can't be right because some birds would have only C or only B. For example:\n\n- C present (C), B absent (b) \u2192 checkered-brown\n- C absent (c), B present (B) \u2192 brown\n- C absent (c), B absent (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, checkered is when C is dominant, regardless of B. And brown is when B is dominant, regardless of C. So, the phenotype combines both traits:\n\n- Both traits are present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only one trait is present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Neither trait is present \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with reality. Actually, I think the correct way is:\n\n- Checkered (C) \u2192 presence of C allele\n- Brown (B) \u2192 presence of B allele\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits:\n\n- Both present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Only one present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Neither present \u2192 checkered\n\nBecause, for example, a bird that is checkered (C present) but not brown (B absent) would have phenotype checkered-brown. Wait, no, if B is absent, the bird is brown. So:\n\n- Checkered (C) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Checkered (C) and not brown (B absent) \u2192 checkered-brown\n- Not checkered (C absent) and brown (B present) \u2192 brown\n- Not checkered (C absent) and not brown (B absent) \u2192 checkered\n\nThis makes sense because:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 checkered-brown\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- All birds where C is present \u2192 checkered-brown (regardless of B)\n- All birds where B is present \u2192 brown\n- All birds where neither C nor B are present \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but that can't be right because some birds could have both C and B, and others not.\n\nActually, the correct",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, there are two outcomes, but since both are present, there are four combinations.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, there are two outcomes, but since both are present, there are four combinations. However, when looking at the phenotype, the presence of any dominant allele leads to a certain trait. Let's consider each gene separately:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (C_: red)\n- Absence of C (c_: plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (B_: brown)\n- Absence of B (b_: checkered)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes can be found by checking if either locus has the dominant allele. The phenotypes are determined by whether any of the traits are present.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered and/or Brown (b_ and B_: both are present)\n- Checkered and/or Red (b_ and C_: both present)\n- Plain and/or Brown (c_ and B_: both present)\n- Plain and/or Red (c_ and C_: both present)\n\nBut wait, actually, each bird will exhibit both traits if both are present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_)\n2. Checkered and Red (b_ and C_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and Red (c_ and C_)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the probability for each gene:\n\n- Probability of C_ (pigment):\n  - Since C is dominant, C_ = 100%\n  - Because both parents are CC, the C allele is always present.\n  \nWait, no. The F1 is CcBb. So for the C locus:\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\n- So F1 is Cc. Thus, the probability of having C_ (Cc) is 75% (since C is dominant).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Parent 1 is BB (since it's CC BB, so both B alleles are B)\n- Parent 2 is bb (since it's cc bb, so both b alleles are b)\n- Thus, F1 is Bb. The probability of having B_ (Bb) is 75%.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each gene:\n- C_: 75% (C_ is present)\n- B_: 75% (B_ is present)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.\n\nLet's list all combinations:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_):\n   - Probability of b_ = 25%\n   - Probability of B_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n2. Checkered and Red (b_ and C_):\n   - Probability of b_ = 25%\n   - Probability of C_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n3. Plain and Brown (c_ and B_):\n   - Probability of c_ = 25%\n   - Probability of B_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. Plain and Red (c_ and C_):\n   - Probability of c_ = 25%\n   - Probability of C_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\nAdding them up: 18.75% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 18.75% = 75%, which makes sense because all birds will either have both traits or neither, but since both genes are expressed, every bird must have at least one trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Actually, each bird will express both traits if both are present. So all four phenotypes are possible, but each has a different probability. However, some phenotypes may overlap. For example, a bird could be both checkered and brown, or both checkered and red, etc.\n\nBut according to our calculations, each phenotype has a 18.75% chance. That adds up to 75%, but we're missing the remaining 25% of the population. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation isn't accurate because the presence of one trait doesn't necessarily affect the others. Wait, no\u2014it's additive. If a bird has either trait, it displays it. So the correct approach is to calculate the probability of each combination.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that each bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes based on the presence of each trait. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So each phenotype has a probability of (probability of trait 1) * (probability of trait 2).\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_):\n  - Probability of b_ = 25%\n  - Probability of B_ = 75%\n  - Together: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\nSimilarly for the others, each gets 18.75%.\n\nThat sums up to 75%, leaving 25% unaccounted for. Oh, because a bird cannot have neither trait unless both are absent, which is 25% (25% for c_ and 25% for b_), totaling 50%. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both traits, it counts towards both. So perhaps my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nLet me try again. Instead of calculating the combined probabilities, maybe I should calculate the number of birds with each phenotype directly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these gametes occurs at 25% frequency. Now, let's map these to the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: C_ (pigment red) and C_ (from C locus) \u2192 red\n- Cc: C_ (pigment red) and B_ (from B locus) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc: c_ (plain) and C_ (pigment red) \u2192 plain-red\n- bb: c_ (plain) and B_ (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n\nNow, let's count how many birds fall into each category:\n\n- CC (25%): All red (phenotype A: red)\n- Cc (25%): Red-brown (B: red-brown)\n- cc (25%): Plain-red (C: plain-red)\n- bb (25%): Plain-brown (D: plain-brown)\n\nNow, what about the other 25%? Those would be the cases where neither pigment nor color is dominant, i.e., c_ and b_. This is 25% (cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25% of the population. But wait, actually, the 25% is already accounted for in the cc (plain) and bb (brown) categories. So perhaps I overcounted. Alternatively, perhaps the total is 100%, so the four phenotypes plus the non-relevant ones make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a Punnett square to get exact numbers. Let me create the Punnett square for the F2 cross.\n\nParental F1: CcBb\n\nCrossing F1 x F1:\n\n          | C | c |\n        ---+---|---|---|\n         C | CC | Cc |\n        ---+---|---|---|\n         c | cC | cc |\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBecause each F1 is CcBb, and when selfing, each gene segregates independently. So for each gene:\n\n- C locus: C and c \u2192 50% C_, 50% c_\n- B locus: B and b \u2192 50% B_, 50% b_\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- C_ and B_: 25%\n- C_ and b_: 25%\n- c_ and B_: 25%\n- c_ and b_: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- C_ and B_: red-brown (phenotype B)\n- C_ and b_: red (phenotype A)\n- c_ and B_: plain-brown (phenotype F)\n- c_ and b_: plain (phenotype G)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in F2. However, this doesn't account for all 100% because some genotypes correspond to the same phenotype. For example, cc (plain) is a single phenotype regardless of the B locus, and similarly for bb (brown) regardless of the C locus.\n\nWait, no\u2014each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A (red): All C_ (pigment red) regardless of B_ (brown or not).\nPhenotype B (red-brown): C_ and B_.\nPhenotype C (plain): c_ (regardless of B_).\nPhenotype D (plain-brown): c_ and B_.\nWait, no\u2014that's overlapping. Maybe better to think in terms of dominance:\n\n- Pigment red: C_ (any B_)\n- Pigment plain: c_ (any B_)\n- Color brown: B_ (any C_)\n- Color plain: b_ (any C_)\n\nSo each bird falls into one of four phenotypes based on the presence of these traits:\n\n1. Both C_ and B_: red-brown\n2. C_ and b_: red\n3. c_ and B_: plain-brown\n4. c_ and b_: plain\n\nEach of these has a 25% probability in the F2 population.\n\nBut wait, that would mean 25% for each phenotype, adding up to 100%. However, the options given don't reflect this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the actual F2 phenotypes based on the possible F1 genotypes. Wait, F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have various genotypes, but each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nGiven that, let's recast the analysis. The F2 individuals will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct breakdown is:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so:\n\n- C locus: 50% C_, 50% c_\n- B locus: 50% B_, 50% b_\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- C_ B_: 25%\n- C_ b_: 25%\n- c_ B_: 25%\n- c_ b_: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C_ B_: red-brown (phenotype B)\n2. C_ b_: red (phenotype A)\n3. c_ B_: plain-brown (phenotype D)\n4. c_ b_: plain (phenotype E)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in the F2 population. However, this doesn't account for all possible combinations correctly, as the presence of both traits affects the phenotype. Let me instead think in terms of possible genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes, then count the occurrences.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red-brown)\n- cc (plain)\n- cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not precise. The actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect. The F2 genotypes are actually:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% cc\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum is 100%, but the last two are both cc. Perhaps the correct distribution is:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% cc\n\nWhich totals 100%. But when looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red (phenotype A)\n- Cc: red-brown (phenotype B)\n- cc: plain (phenotype E)\n\nSo the phenotypes are A, B, E, and C (plain-brown?) Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the phenotypes. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_): phenotype B\n- Checkered and Red (b_ and C_): phenotype A\n- Plain and Brown (c_ and B_): phenotype D\n- Plain and Red (c_ and C_): phenotype E\n\nIn this case, each of these four phenotypes has a 25% chance in F2. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% each, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But this contradicts the answer choices provided, which don't have such a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me consider that in the F2 generation, some phenotypes might combine differently. For instance, if a bird has both C_ and b_, it's red, and if it also has B_, it's red-brown. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, each phenotype has a 25% occurrence, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer options match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Not sure.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, but the total is 16, but the options don't seem to add up.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, and the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which resembles a Mendelian ratio.\n\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 12, which doesn\u2019t align.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Again, 3:9:1:3, similar to option C.\n\nOption C has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which fits the idea of a dihybrid cross where each gene is independent. However, in reality, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, so the phenotypic ratio would be based on the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation suggested each phenotype has 25% prevalence, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird will display both traits if they have at least one dominant allele in either gene.

The F2 genotypes after selfing are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: red (A)\n- Cc: red-brown (B)\n- cc: plain (E)\n\nEach of these has 25% occurrence, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. But wait, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible phenotypes without considering the F1's influence, but that's not applicable here.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 which matches a 9:3:3:1 ratio, suggesting that two genes are influencing the phenotype, each with two alleles.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two outcomes, but since both are present, there are four combinations. However, when looking at the phenotype, the presence of any dominant allele leads to a certain trait. Let's consider each gene separately:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (C_: red)\n- Absence of C (c_: plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (B_: brown)\n- Absence of B (b_: checkered)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes can be found by checking if either locus has the dominant allele. The phenotypes are determined by whether any of the traits are present.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered and/or Brown (b_ and B_: both are present)\n- Checkered and/or Red (b_ and C_: both present)\n- Plain and/or Brown (c_ and B_: both present)\n- Plain and/or Red (c_ and C_: both present)\n\nBut wait, actually, each bird will exhibit both traits if both are present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_)\n2. Checkered and Red (b_ and C_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and Red (c_ and C_)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the probability for each gene:\n\n- Probability of C_ (pigment):\n  - Since C is dominant, C_ = 100%\n  - Because both parents are CC, the C allele is always present.\n  \nWait, no. The F1 is CcBb. So for the C locus:\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\n- So F1 is Cc. Thus, the probability of having C_ (Cc) is 75% (since C is dominant).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Parent 1 is BB (since it's CC BB, so both B alleles are B)\n- Parent 2 is bb (since it's cc bb, so both b alleles are b)\n- Thus, F1 is Bb. The probability of having B_ (Bb) is 75%.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each gene:\n- C_: 75% (C_ is present)\n- B_: 75% (B_ is present)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.\n\nLet's list all combinations:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_):\n   - Probability of b_ = 25%\n   - Probability of B_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n2. Checkered and Red (b_ and C_):\n   - Probability of b_ = 25%\n   - Probability of C_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n3. Plain and Brown (c_ and B_):\n   - Probability of c_ = 25%\n   - Probability of B_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. Plain and Red (c_ and C_):\n   - Probability of c_ = 25%\n   - Probability of C_ = 75%\n   - Combined probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\nAdding them up: 18.75% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 18.75% = 75%, which makes sense because all birds will either have both traits or neither, but since both genes are expressed, every bird must have at least one trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Actually, each bird will express both traits if both are present. So all four phenotypes are possible, but each has a different probability. However, some phenotypes may overlap. For example, a bird could be both checkered and brown, or both checkered and red, etc.\n\nBut according to our calculations, each phenotype has a 18.75% chance. That adds up to 75%, but we're missing the remaining 25% of the population. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation isn't accurate because the presence of one trait doesn't necessarily affect the others. Wait, no\u2014it's additive. If a bird has either trait, it displays it. So the correct approach is to calculate the probability of each combination.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that each bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes based on the presence of each trait. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So each phenotype has a probability of (probability of trait 1) * (probability of trait 2).\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_):\n  - Probability of b_ = 25%\n  - Probability of B_ = 75%\n  - Together: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\nSimilarly for the others, each gets 18.75%.\n\nThat sums up to 75%, leaving 25% unaccounted for. Oh, because a bird cannot have neither trait unless both are absent, which is 25% (25% for c_ and 25% for b_), totaling 50%. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both traits, it counts towards both. So perhaps my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nLet me try again. Instead of calculating the combined probabilities, maybe I should calculate the number of birds with each phenotype directly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these gametes occurs at 25% frequency. Now, let's map these to the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: C_ (pigment red) and C_ (from C locus) \u2192 red\n- Cc: C_ (pigment red) and B_ (from B locus) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc: c_ (plain) and C_ (pigment red) \u2192 plain-red\n- bb: c_ (plain) and B_ (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n\nNow, let's count how many birds fall into each category:\n\n- CC (25%): All red (phenotype A: red)\n- Cc (25%): Red-brown (B: red-brown)\n- cc (25%): Plain-red (C: plain-red)\n- bb (25%): Plain-brown (D: plain-brown)\n\nNow, what about the other 25%? Those would be the cases where neither pigment nor color is dominant, i.e., c_ and b_. This is 25% (cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25% of the population. But wait, actually, the 25% is already accounted for in the cc (plain) and bb (brown) categories. So perhaps I overcounted. Alternatively, perhaps the total is 100%, so the four phenotypes plus the non-relevant ones make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a Punnett square to get exact numbers. Let me create the Punnett square for the F2 cross.\n\nParental F1: CcBb\n\nCrossing F1 x F1:\n\n          | C | c |\n        ---+---|---|---|\n         C | CC | Cc |\n        ---+---|---|---|\n         c | cC | cc |\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBecause each F1 is CcBb, and when selfing, each gene segregates independently. So for each gene:\n\n- C locus: C and c \u2192 50% C_, 50% c_\n- B locus: B and b \u2192 50% B_, 50% b_\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- C_ and B_: 25%\n- C_ and b_: 25%\n- c_ and B_: 25%\n- c_ and b_: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- C_ and B_: red-brown (phenotype B)\n- C_ and b_: red (phenotype A)\n- c_ and B_: plain-brown (phenotype F)\n- c_ and b_: plain (phenotype G)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in F2. However, this doesn't account for all 100% because some genotypes correspond to the same phenotype. For example, cc (plain) is a single phenotype regardless of the B locus, and similarly for bb (brown) regardless of the C locus.\n\nWait, no\u2014each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A (red): All C_ (pigment red) regardless of B_ (brown or not).\nPhenotype B (red-brown): C_ and B_.\nPhenotype C (plain): c_ (regardless of B_).\nPhenotype D (plain-brown): c_ and B_.\nWait, no\u2014that's overlapping. Maybe better to think in terms of dominance:\n\n- Pigment red: C_ (any B_)\n- Pigment plain: c_ (any B_)\n- Color brown: B_ (any C_)\n- Color plain: b_ (any C_)\n\nSo each bird falls into one of four phenotypes based on the presence of these traits:\n\n1. Both C_ and B_: red-brown\n2. C_ and b_: red\n3. c_ and B_: plain-brown\n4. c_ and b_: plain\n\nEach of these has a 25% probability in the F2 population.\n\nBut wait, that would mean 25% for each phenotype, adding up to 100%. However, the options given don't reflect this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the actual F2 phenotypes based on the possible F1 genotypes. Wait, F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have various genotypes, but each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nGiven that, let's recast the analysis. The F2 individuals will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct breakdown is:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so:\n\n- C locus: 50% C_, 50% c_\n- B locus: 50% B_, 50% b_\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- C_ B_: 25%\n- C_ b_: 25%\n- c_ B_: 25%\n- c_ b_: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C_ B_: red-brown (phenotype B)\n2. C_ b_: red (phenotype A)\n3. c_ B_: plain-brown (phenotype D)\n4. c_ b_: plain (phenotype E)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in the F2 population. However, this doesn't account for all possible combinations correctly, as the presence of both traits affects the phenotype. Let me instead think in terms of possible genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes, then count the occurrences.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red-brown)\n- cc (plain)\n- cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not precise. The actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect. The F2 genotypes are actually:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% cc\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum is 100%, but the last two are both cc. Perhaps the correct distribution is:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% cc\n\nWhich totals 100%. But when looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red (phenotype A)\n- Cc: red-brown (phenotype B)\n- cc: plain (phenotype E)\n\nSo the phenotypes are A, B, E, and C (plain-brown?) Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the phenotypes. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and Brown (b_ and B_): phenotype B\n- Checkered and Red (b_ and C_): phenotype A\n- Plain and Brown (c_ and B_): phenotype D\n- Plain and Red (c_ and C_): phenotype E\n\nIn this case, each of these four phenotypes has a 25% chance in F2. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% each, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But this contradicts the answer choices provided, which don't have such a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me consider that in the F2 generation, some phenotypes might combine differently. For instance, if a bird has both C_ and b_, it's red, and if it also has B_, it's red-brown. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, each phenotype has a 25% occurrence, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer options match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Not sure.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, but the total is 16, but the options don't seem to add up.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, and the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which resembles a Mendelian ratio.\n\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 12, which doesn\u2019t align.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Again, 3:9:1:3, similar to option C.\n\nOption C has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which fits the idea of a dihybrid cross where each gene is independent. However, in reality, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, so the phenotypic ratio would be based on the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation suggested each phenotype has 25% prevalence, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird will display both traits if they have at least one dominant allele in either gene. So:\n\n- If a bird has C_, it will be red.\n- If a bird has B_, it will be brown.\n- If a bird has both C_ and B_, it will be red-brown.\n\nNow, the F2 generation's genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes after selfing are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red-brown)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: red (A)\n- Cc: red-brown (B)\n- cc: plain (E)\n\nEach of these has 25% occurrence, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. But wait, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible phenotypes without considering the F1's influence, but that's not applicable here.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 which matches a 9:3:3:1 ratio, suggesting that two genes are influencing the phenotype, each with two alleles. This seems like a dihybrid cross scenario, where each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nIf the F2 generation were from a dihybrid cross (like F1 x F1), the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the 25% split across four phenotypes. So option C suggests a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which would fit this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely option C: Phenotypic ratio 9, 3, 3, 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Plain brown (C_ and bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify: Each gene contributes to the phenotype. The actual phenotype depends on both genes. For example, if the bird has C_ (pigmented) and B_, then it's brown and red, which might look like a different color, but in terms of our options, it would fall under brown-red or something else. But according to the problem statement, the options are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the recessive alleles for each gene. Let's list them:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 checkered red\nPhenotype 2: Only B_ (recessive c, dominant B) \u2192 plain brown\nPhenotype 3: Only C_ (recessive c, dominant C) \u2192 plain red\nPhenotype 4: Both dominant (C_ and B_) \u2192 brown-red or another color, but according to the problem, this isn't listed. Wait, the problem mentions four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So maybe we don't consider the brown-red phenotype as separate, or perhaps it's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant B is expressed even without C, making it brown regardless of C. Hmm, but I think the standard approach is to consider the presence of both recessive alleles leads to the most specific phenotype. \n\nBut given the problem lists four phenotypes, perhaps we'll proceed with the assumption that:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive (cc and bb)\n- Plain: either cc (if B is dominant) or bb (if C is dominant)\n- Brown: either B_ (regardless of C) or C_ (regardless of B)\n- Red: either C_ (regardless of B) or B_ (regardless of C)\n\nBut the exact way the phenotypes combine may affect the ratio. To calculate the expected phenotypic ratio, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are assumed to assort independently, we can use a Punnett square approach where each gene is considered separately, then multiplied for the combined effect.\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (Pigmentation):\n\n- Probability of C_: 75% (since CC and Cc are present)\n- Probability of cc: 25%\n\nFor Gene B (Color):\n\n- Probability of B_: 75% (since BB and Bb are present)\n- Probability of bb: 25%\n\nNow, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by considering all combinations of the two genes. However, the way the phenotypes are defined as 'checkered', 'plain', 'brown', and 'red' implies that:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 product of (prob cc) * (prob bb)\n= 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n\n- Plain: Either cc (25%) or bb (25%). But wait, in reality, the presence of any recessive allele in either gene results in a different phenotype. So plain would include:\n\n  - Any cc (regardless of B): 25%\n  - Any bb (regardless of C): 25%\n  But wait, that double-counts the case where both are recessive (cc and bb), which was already counted in checkered. So total plain = (25% + 25%) - (25%) = 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to think in terms of all possible cases except checkered:\n\nTotal phenotypes without checking: any phenotype except checkered. So checkered is the recessive condition for both genes.\n\nThus, the remaining phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: only B_ (75%) but not cc (so 75% - 25% = 50% of B_ cases)\n- Checkered red: only cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Plain brown: only C_ (75%), but not bb (so 75% - 25% = 50%)\n- Plain red: only cc (25%)\n\nWait, but hold on. If we're looking at the phenotypes as checkered, plain, brown, red, then the breakdown is as follows:\n\nCheckered: cc and bb \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPlain: cc (25%) + bb (25%) - overlap (cc and bb) \u2192 25% + 25% - 25% = 50%\nBrown: B_ (75%) including bb and cc?\nNo, wait. Brown is expressed when B_ is present, regardless of C. So brown includes:\n\n- B_ and C_: brown-red\n- B_ and cc: brown-red\n- bb and C_: brown\n- bb and cc: brown-red\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of phenotypic classes. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype that determines its phenotype. The four phenotypes correspond to the following genotypic combinations:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (B is present as B_), but also bb (C is present as C_), so genotype is cc and bb \u2192 (cc)(bb)\n2. Checkered brown: cc (but B is absent) \u2192 genotype cc and bb (with B recessive)\n3. Plain red: cc (but B is present) \u2192 genotype cc and bb (with B dominant)\n4. Plain brown: cc (and B dominant) or bb (and C dominant) \u2192 genotype cc (B dominant) or bb (C dominant)\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are defined as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, so perhaps we don't distinguish further into red vs brown beyond the dominant traits. Alternatively, perhaps the brown phenotype includes both B_ and non-B_, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined solely by whether the bird is checkered or not, and whether it's brown or not, regardless of the other gene. That is, if a bird is checkered (cc), it could be brown or red. If it's not checkered (either cc or bb), it's either brown or red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the presence of the recessive alleles.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: cc\n- Non-checkered: cc and bb\n\nWithin non-checkered:\n\n- Brown: B_\n- Red: bb\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be calculated based on the proportion of each:\n\n- Checkered (cc): 25%\n- Non-checkered (cc or bb):\n  - Brown (B_): 75% (since B_ includes B_ and cc)\n  - Red (bb): 25%\n\nHowever, since non-checkered includes both cc and bb, the combined percentage is 50%, with 75% brown and 25% red within non-checkered.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: 25% (for non-checkered) * 75% (brown within non-checkered) = 18.75%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 49.99 \u2248 50%, which accounts for all possibilities. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 6.25% checkered red : 18.75% checkered brown : 6.25% plain red : 18.75% plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match my calculation. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option A matches my earlier thought, but I think I made a mistake there. Wait, no\u2014in my previous analysis, the checkered red was 6.25% (about 1 part), checkered brown 18.75% (about 3 parts), plain red 6.25% (about 1 part), and plain brown 18.75% (about 3 parts). If we scale to whole numbers, 1:3:1:3, which would translate to 1,3,1,3 parts. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No.\nWait, none of the options exactly match my ratio of 1:3:1:3. Perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - C_: Red (dominant)\n  - cc: Plain (recessive)\n  \n- Color (B):\n  - B_: Brown (dominant)\n  - bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of recessive alleles in both genes. So the order of priority for phenotype recognition is usually based on the presence of the recessive alleles, starting with the most specific. So:\n\n1. Checkered (both recessive)\n2. Checkered brown (only B recessive)\n3. Checkered red (only C recessive)\n4. Plain red (only C dominant)\n5. Plain brown (only B dominant)\n6. Brown-red (both dominant)\n\nBut according to the problem, the phenotypes are checkedered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps brown-red is grouped as a single phenotype, but that's not what the problem states. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines the phenotype as whether the bird is checkered or not, and whether it's brown or red, irrespective of the other gene. In that case:\n\n- Checkered: cc\n- Non-checkered: (cc or bb)\n  - Within non-checkered:\n    - Brown: B_\n    - Red: bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n- Non-checkered:\n  - Brown: 75%\n  - Red: 25%\n\nBut since non-checkered includes both cc and bb, the percentages are:\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n- Non-checkered brown: 75% of non-checkered \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Non-checkered red: 25% of non-checkered \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo the ratio is 25% : 18.75% : 6.25% \u2192 Which simplifies to 1 : 3 : 1. But scaled up to whole numbers, 1,3,1,3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the percentage differently. Let me see:\n\nIf the F2 ratio is 1:3:1:3, then checkered red is 1/8, checkered brown 3/8, plain red 1/8, plain brown 3/8. Scaling up by 8, we get 1,3,1,3. So option D is 1,3,9,3\u2014which seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the percentages.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered (cc and bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown (cc and B_): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered red (cc and bb): same as above, 6.25%\n- Plain brown (non-checkered and B_): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red (non-checkered and bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Brown-red (non-checkered and both dominant): ?\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps brown-red is merged into plain brown, but that's not how the problem defines it. Alternatively, perhaps brown-red is a distinct phenotype, but the problem groups it with plain brown. This suggests that the problem defines the phenotype as the presence of the recessive alleles, leading to:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive \u2192 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: only B recessive \u2192 18.75%\n- Checkered red: only C recessive \u2192 6.25%\n- Plain red: only C dominant \u2192 6.25%\n- Plain brown: only B dominant \u2192 18.75%\n- Brown-red: both dominant \u2192 ?\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So brown-red is not listed, implying it's grouped with plain brown. Thus, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 6.25%\n- Plain brown: 18.75%\nTotal: 50%\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it's 6.25:18.75:6.25:18.75, which simplifies to 1:3:1:3. Scaling up to whole numbers, we'd have 1,3,1,3. But looking at the options, none seem to match this exactly. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is similar to 6.25:18.75:6.25:18.75 scaled by 16, giving 100,300,100,300, which reduces to 1:3:1:3, but represented as 6:2:6:2. Wait, no\u2014if we take 1:3:1:3 and represent it as 6:2:6:2 by multiplying by 6, that would make sense. So 6.25% becomes 6%, 18.75% becomes 2%, and so on. But the original ratio is 1:3:1:3, which is equivalent to 6:2:6:2 when scaled by 6. So if the answer expects the ratio in whole numbers, 6:2:6:2, but that's not among the options. Wait, option A is 6,2,6,2, which is the scaled version. But the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the answer would be 6:2:6:2, but that's not an option. Looking back, option G is 12,2,2,0, which is wrong because there are four phenotypes. Option I is 7,5,1,3, which is not matching. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is reverse. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, which is not correct. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is not matching. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which is not matching. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Wait, but the problem specifies the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which corresponds to the ratio 1:3:1:3, which scales to 6:2:6:2 if multiplied by 6. So option A is 6,2,6,2. But wait, in the options, option A is written as \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That's not correct because 1:3:1:3 scales to 6:2:6:2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm confused because the initial calculation didn't match the options directly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother method is to create a Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, where F1 is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. The F1 individuals will produce gametes as follows:\n\nFrom CcBB:\n- Cc (C_B_)\n\nFrom ccbb:\n- cb (c_bb)\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n\nBecause each allele is independent, the possible combinations are:\n\n- C from Cc and c from cb \u2192 Cc\n- C from Cc and b from cb \u2192 Cb\n- c from Cc and c from cb \u2192 cc\n- c from Cc and b from cb \u2192 cb\n\nSo the gametes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Assuming that the genes are assorting independently. Now, the F2 phenotypic ratio can be found by calculating the probability of each phenotype. Each trait is determined by the dominance of alleles. So for each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nSince both genes are being considered together, the combined phenotypes depend on both genes. The F2 generation will have four possible phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Checkered red (both genes recessive: cc and bb)\n2. Checkered brown (cc and B_: brown)\n3. Plain red (C_ and bb)\n4. Plain brown (C_ and bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify: Each gene contributes to the phenotype. The actual phenotype depends on both genes. For example, if the bird has C_ (pigmented) and B_, then it's brown and red, which might look like a different color, but in terms of our options, it would fall under brown-red or something else. But according to the problem statement, the options are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the recessive alleles for each gene. Let's list them:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 checkered red\nPhenotype 2: Only B_ (recessive c, dominant B) \u2192 plain brown\nPhenotype 3: Only C_ (recessive c, dominant C) \u2192 plain red\nPhenotype 4: Both dominant (C_ and B_) \u2192 brown-red or another color, but according to the problem, this isn't listed. Wait, the problem mentions four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So maybe we don't consider the brown-red phenotype as separate, or perhaps it's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant B is expressed even without C, making it brown regardless of C. Hmm, but I think the standard approach is to consider the presence of both recessive alleles leads to the most specific phenotype. \n\nBut given the problem lists four phenotypes, perhaps we'll proceed with the assumption that:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive (cc and bb)\n- Plain: either cc (if B is dominant) or bb (if C is dominant)\n- Brown: either B_ (regardless of C) or C_ (regardless of B)\n- Red: either C_ (regardless of B) or B_ (regardless of C)\n\nBut the exact way the phenotypes combine may affect the ratio. To calculate the expected phenotypic ratio, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are assumed to assort independently, we can use a Punnett square approach where each gene is considered separately, then multiplied for the combined effect.\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (Pigmentation):\n\n- Probability of C_: 75% (since CC and Cc are present)\n- Probability of cc: 25%\n\nFor Gene B (Color):\n\n- Probability of B_: 75% (since BB and Bb are present)\n- Probability of bb: 25%\n\nNow, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by considering all combinations of the two genes. However, the way the phenotypes are defined as 'checkered', 'plain', 'brown', and 'red' implies that:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 product of (prob cc) * (prob bb)\n= 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n\n- Plain: Either cc (25%) or bb (25%). But wait, in reality, the presence of any recessive allele in either gene results in a different phenotype. So plain would include:\n\n  - Any cc (regardless of B): 25%\n  - Any bb (regardless of C): 25%\n  But wait, that double-counts the case where both are recessive (cc and bb), which was already counted in checkered. So total plain = (25% + 25%) - (25%) = 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to think in terms of all possible cases except checkered:\n\nTotal phenotypes without checking: any phenotype except checkered. So checkered is the recessive condition for both genes.\n\nThus, the remaining phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: only B_ (75%) but not cc (so 75% - 25% = 50% of B_ cases)\n- Checkered red: only cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Plain brown: only C_ (75%), but not bb (so 75% - 25% = 50%)\n- Plain red: only cc (25%)\n\nWait, but hold on. If we're looking at the phenotypes as checkered, plain, brown, red, then the breakdown is as follows:\n\nCheckered: cc and bb \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPlain: cc (25%) + bb (25%) - overlap (cc and bb) \u2192 25% + 25% - 25% = 50%\nBrown: B_ (75%) including bb and cc?\nNo, wait. Brown is expressed when B_ is present, regardless of C. So brown includes:\n\n- B_ and C_: brown-red\n- B_ and cc: brown-red\n- bb and C_: brown\n- bb and cc: brown-red\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of phenotypic classes. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype that determines its phenotype. The four phenotypes correspond to the following genotypic combinations:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (B is present as B_), but also bb (C is present as C_), so genotype is cc and bb \u2192 (cc)(bb)\n2. Checkered brown: cc (but B is absent) \u2192 genotype cc and bb (with B recessive)\n3. Plain red: cc (but B is present) \u2192 genotype cc and bb (with B dominant)\n4. Plain brown: cc (and B dominant) or bb (and C dominant) \u2192 genotype cc (B dominant) or bb (C dominant)\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are defined as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, so perhaps we don't distinguish further into red vs brown beyond the dominant traits. Alternatively, perhaps the brown phenotype includes both B_ and non-B_, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined solely by whether the bird is checkered or not, and whether it's brown or not, regardless of the other gene. That is, if a bird is checkered (cc), it could be brown or red. If it's not checkered (either cc or bb), it's either brown or red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the presence of the recessive alleles.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: cc\n- Non-checkered: cc and bb\n\nWithin non-checkered:\n\n- Brown: B_\n- Red: bb\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be calculated based on the proportion of each:\n\n- Checkered (cc): 25%\n- Non-checkered (cc or bb):\n  - Brown (B_): 75% (since B_ includes B_ and cc)\n  - Red (bb): 25%\n\nHowever, since non-checkered includes both cc and bb, the combined percentage is 50%, with 75% brown and 25% red within non-checkered.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: 25% (for non-checkered) * 75% (brown within non-checkered) = 18.75%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 49.99 \u2248 50%, which accounts for all possibilities. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 6.25% checkered red : 18.75% checkered brown : 6.25% plain red : 18.75% plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match my calculation. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option A matches my earlier thought, but I think I made a mistake there. Wait, no\u2014in my previous analysis, the checkered red was 6.25% (about 1 part), checkered brown 18.75% (about 3 parts), plain red 6.25% (about 1 part), and plain brown 18.75% (about 3 parts). If we scale to whole numbers, 1:3:1:3, which would translate to 1,3,1,3 parts. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No.\nWait, none of the options exactly match my ratio of 1:3:1:3. Perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - C_: Red (dominant)\n  - cc: Plain (recessive)\n  \n- Color (B):\n  - B_: Brown (dominant)\n  - bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of recessive alleles in both genes. So the order of priority for phenotype recognition is usually based on the presence of the recessive alleles, starting with the most specific. So:\n\n1. Checkered (both recessive)\n2. Checkered brown (only B recessive)\n3. Checkered red (only C recessive)\n4. Plain red (only C dominant)\n5. Plain brown (only B dominant)\n6. Brown-red (both dominant)\n\nBut according to the problem, the phenotypes are checkedered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps brown-red is grouped as a single phenotype, but that's not what the problem states. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines the phenotype as whether the bird is checkered or not, and whether it's brown or red, irrespective of the other gene. In that case:\n\n- Checkered: cc\n- Non-checkered: (cc or bb)\n  - Within non-checkered:\n    - Brown: B_\n    - Red: bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n- Non-checkered:\n  - Brown: 75%\n  - Red: 25%\n\nBut since non-checkered includes both cc and bb, the percentages are:\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n- Non-checkered brown: 75% of non-checkered \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Non-checkered red: 25% of non-checkered \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo the ratio is 25% : 18.75% : 6.25% \u2192 Which simplifies to 1 : 3 : 1. But scaled up to whole numbers, 1,3,1,3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the percentage differently. Let me see:\n\nIf the F2 ratio is 1:3:1:3, then checkered red is 1/8, checkered brown 3/8, plain red 1/8, plain brown 3/8. Scaling up by 8, we get 1,3,1,3. So option D is 1,3,9,3\u2014which seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the percentages.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered (cc and bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown (cc and B_): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered red (cc and bb): same as above, 6.25%\n- Plain brown (non-checkered and B_): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red (non-checkered and bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Brown-red (non-checkered and both dominant): ?\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps brown-red is merged into plain brown, but that's not how the problem defines it. Alternatively, perhaps brown-red is a distinct phenotype, but the problem groups it with plain brown. This suggests that the problem defines the phenotype as the presence of the recessive alleles, leading to:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive \u2192 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: only B recessive \u2192 18.75%\n- Checkered red: only C recessive \u2192 6.25%\n- Plain red: only C dominant \u2192 6.25%\n- Plain brown: only B dominant \u2192 18.75%\n- Brown-red: both dominant \u2192 ?\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So brown-red is not listed, implying it's grouped with plain brown. Thus, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 6.25%\n- Plain brown: 18.75%\nTotal: 50%\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it's 6.25:18.75:6.25:18.75, which simplifies to 1:3:1:3. Scaling up to whole numbers, we'd have 1,3,1,3. But looking at the options, none seem to match this exactly. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is similar to 6.25:18.75:6.25:18.75 scaled by 16, giving 100,300,100,300, which reduces to 1:3:1:3, but represented as 6:2:6:2. Wait, no\u2014if we take 1:3:1:3 and represent it as 6:2:6:2 by multiplying by 6, that would make sense. So 6.25% becomes 6%, 18.75% becomes 2%, and so on. But the original ratio is 1:3:1:3, which is equivalent to 6:2:6:2 when scaled by 6. So if the answer expects the ratio in whole numbers, 6:2:6:2, but that's not among the options. Wait, option A is 6,2,6,2, which is the scaled version. But the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the answer would be 6:2:6:2, but that's not an option. Looking back, option G is 12,2,2,0, which is wrong because there are four phenotypes. Option I is 7,5,1,3, which is not matching. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is reverse. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, which is not correct. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is not matching. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which is not matching. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Wait, but the problem specifies the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which corresponds to the ratio 1:3:1:3, which scales to 6:2:6:2 if multiplied by 6. So option A is 6,2,6,2. But wait, in the options, option A is written as \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That's not correct because 1:3:1:3 scales to 6:2:6:2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm confused because the initial calculation didn't match the options directly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother method is to create a Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, where F1 is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. The F1 individuals will produce gametes as follows:\n\nFrom CcBB:\n- Cc (C_B_)\n\nFrom ccbb:\n- cb (c_bb)\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n\nBecause each allele is independent, the possible combinations are:\n\n- C from Cc and c from cb \u2192 Cc\n- C from Cc and b from cb \u2192 Cb\n- c from Cc and c from cb \u2192 cc\n- c from Cc and b from cb \u2192 cb\n\nSo the gametes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

However, some of these might combine into similar traits if certain conditions are met. For example, if both genes are recessive, the bird would be completely plain. Similarly, if both genes are dominant, it would be fully red. If only one is dominant, it could be a mix.\n\nBut according to the user's options, the choices involve various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. So, let's calculate the expected phenotypic ratio for F2.\n\nIn F2, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive). But since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratios are multiplicative. So for each gene, the ratios are:\n\n- C: 3:1 (dominant:recessive)\n- B: 3:1 (dominant:recessive)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall ratio is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for each possible combination. Wait, but there are four possible phenotypes, each corresponding to different combinations of dominance.\n\nAlternatively, each gene contributes a factor. For each gene, the probability of being dominant is 3/4 and recessive is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nThe four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1.

The four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment dominant, color absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment absent, color dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if both genes are recessive, then the bird would be entirely plain and brown, which is a different phenotype than plain red. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B present) \u2192 9/16\n2. Checkered brown (c and B present) \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red (C and b absent) \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain brown (c and b absent) \u2192 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the user's answer options don't have this exact format. Looking back, the options provided are A to H, each giving specific ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. Perhaps the user intended to use a different approach where each gene is considered separately, leading to a 3:1 ratio per gene, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 overall ratio. But the given options don't exactly match this.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, matching the total. But according to my calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D. However, in reality, the presence of the dominant allele for one gene may mask the effect of the other, leading to different phenotypic categories. For instance, if the presence of pigment makes the bird look brown regardless of color, then the distinction between plain red and checkered red might merge. But in standard Mendelian genetics, each trait is considered independently unless stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Plain brown (c and b absent) \u2192 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the user's answer options don't have this exact format. Looking back, the options provided are A to H, each giving specific ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. Perhaps the user intended to use a different approach where each gene is considered separately, leading to a 3:1 ratio per gene, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 overall ratio. But the given options don't exactly match this.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, matching the total. But according to my calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D. However, in reality, the presence of the dominant allele for one gene may mask the effect of the other, leading to different phenotypic categories. For instance, if the presence of pigment makes the bird look brown regardless of color, then the distinction between plain red and checkered red might merge. But in standard Mendelian genetics, each trait is considered independently unless stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So among the options, D matches this ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

    "rollout": " \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (since it's dominant-recessive). However, when looking at two genes, the combined phenotype depends on the combination of both traits. The total number of phenotypes would be 3 (for pigment) \u00d7 3 (for color) = 9 possible phenotypes. But the actual phenotypic ratios may vary depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, some phenotypes might overlap if the traits are additive or if one trait masks another. However, in this case, since each gene contributes independently, the phenotypes are distinct. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. Let me list them:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_: C present and B present)\n2. Checkered Brown (C_bb: C present, B absent)\n3. Plain Red (cc_B_: C absent, B present)\n4. Plain Brown (cc_bb: both absent)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Probability of C present (C_: 2/3)\n- Probability of C absent (cc: 1/3)\n\nFor the color (B):\n- Probability of B present (B_: 2/3)\n- Probability of B absent (bb: 1/3)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Both C present and B present: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C present and B absent: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3.

But the options given don't match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices.\n\nOptions A-G are various ratios. Looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, no. Option H says 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The phenotypic ratio is 4 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown. So adding up: 4+2+2+1=9. But none of the options directly reflect 4:2:2:1. Wait, looking back, option G says Checkered Red 12, which is way higher. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, but considering the dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypes are 1/3 Checkered Red, 2/3 Checkered Brown, 1/3 Plain Red, 2/3 Plain Brown. Because each gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s when each gene is considered separately. Actually, the correct approach is to calculate the probability for each phenotype by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's state.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I confused something. Let me clarify: The correct way is to consider all combinations. So for the pigment (C):\n\n- C_: 2/3\n- cc: 1/3\n\nFor the color (B):\n\n- B_: 2/3\n- bb: 1/3\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. C_ and B_: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C_ and bb: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc and B_: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc and bb: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Which corresponds to Checkered Red being 4 parts, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Red 2, Plain Brown 1. But looking at the answer options, none seem to match this exactly except possibly option E, which is 3,9,1,3. No, that's different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question asks specifically about the F2 generation. So in my previous analysis, the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 4:2:2:1. None of the answer choices directly say 4:2:2:1. Wait, looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 That doesn't match. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Also not matching. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that's the case, then F1 would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. But that also isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the problem statement. The user mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They provide a Punnett square for F1 (which is CcBb), and then mention the F2 generation. In the problem description, the user provides the F2 results as:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Total 12\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nL. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nM. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, none of these options add up to 16 except options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M.

But looking at the options, none of them are 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the intended answer is option G, which assumes a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's usually when considering three traits, not two. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly worded, and the correct answer is 12:2:2:0, which is option G, assuming that the color and pigment are additive and thus overriding each other. Wait, no\u2014if both traits are expressed, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1, as per my earlier calculation. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the counts. Let me see:\n\nIf the F2 generation has 4 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown, that totals 9. But the options provided do not include this exact ratio. However, option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which sums to 16. That doesn't align. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. The total phenotypic ratio is calculated by considering all combinations of the two traits:\n\n1. C_ and B_: (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C_ and bb: (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc and B_: (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9 \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc and bb: (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding these fractions gives 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nLooking through the options:\n\nOption G is 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\n\nOption E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\n\nOption C is 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, where all are CcBb, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the correct answer is supposed to be 12:2:2:0, which would imply that all checkered birds are plain brown, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, and the intended answer is 12:2:2:0, which would correspond to option G. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation but considering the dominance, making the ratio 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G.

Option C is 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16, which doesn't match the total of 9. Option G is 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given that the question is about the F2 generation, and the possible answers are limited, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which suggests a 9:3:3:1 ratio, even though the calculation shows a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct F2 ratio is 4:2:2:1, but since none of the options match, I must conclude that the intended answer is option G, which states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, possibly under an incorrect assumption.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (since it's dominant-recessive). However, when looking at two genes, the combined phenotype depends on the combination of both traits. The total number of phenotypes would be 3 (for pigment) \u00d7 3 (for color) = 9 possible phenotypes. But the actual phenotypic ratios may vary depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, some phenotypes might overlap if the traits are additive or if one trait masks another. However, in this case, since each gene contributes independently, the phenotypes are distinct. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. Let me list them:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_: C present and B present)\n2. Checkered Brown (C_bb: C present, B absent)\n3. Plain Red (cc_B_: C absent, B present)\n4. Plain Brown (cc_bb: both absent)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Probability of C present (C_: 2/3)\n- Probability of C absent (cc: 1/3)\n\nFor the color (B):\n- Probability of B present (B_: 2/3)\n- Probability of B absent (bb: 1/3)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Both C present and B present: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C present and B absent: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C absent and B present: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Both absent: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown. Adding these up: 4+2+2+1=9. But the options given don't match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices.\n\nOptions A-G are various ratios. Looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, no. Option H says 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 That matches our calculation (3 Checkered Red, 9 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown), summing to 16, which is more than 9. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The phenotypic ratio is 4 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown. So adding up: 4+2+2+1=9. But none of the options directly reflect 4:2:2:1. Wait, looking back, option G says Checkered Red 12, which is way higher. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, but considering the dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypes are 1/3 Checkered Red, 2/3 Checkered Brown, 1/3 Plain Red, 2/3 Plain Brown. Because each gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s when each gene is considered separately. Actually, the correct approach is to calculate the probability for each phenotype by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's state.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I confused something. Let me clarify: The correct way is to consider all combinations. So for the pigment (C):\n\n- C_: 2/3\n- cc: 1/3\n\nFor the color (B):\n\n- B_: 2/3\n- bb: 1/3\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. C_ and B_: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C_ and bb: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc and B_: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc and bb: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Which corresponds to Checkered Red being 4 parts, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Red 2, Plain Brown 1. But looking at the answer options, none seem to match this exactly except possibly option E, which is 3,9,1,3. No, that's different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question asks specifically about the F2 generation. So in my previous analysis, the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 4:2:2:1. None of the answer choices directly say 4:2:2:1. Wait, looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 That doesn't match. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Also not matching. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that's the case, then F1 would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. But that also isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the problem statement. The user mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They provide a Punnett square for F1 (which is CcBb), and then mention the F2 generation. In the problem description, the user provides the F2 results as:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Total 12\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nL. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\nM. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, none of these options add up to 16 except options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M.

Then, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not any of the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation, and the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G, where checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to my earlier calculation, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. Wait, no\u2014it's 4:2:2:1, which sums to 9. But none of the options match this. However, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would make sense if the traits were completely dominant, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, where all offspring are CcBb, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So, each gene has a 3:1 ratio for phenotype expression. Therefore, the combined phenotypic ratio for both genes would be 9:3:3:1, where 9 is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Wait, that seems different from some options given. Let me see the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum to 16\nB. 8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192sum 16\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192sum 16\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192sum 12\nK.etc.\n\nWait, the total number of offspring must be 16, since each parent contributes 8 gametes, making 16 F2 offspring. Looking back at option C, the numbers add up to 16 (9+3+3+1=16). That makes sense because each gene contributes a 3:1 ratio, leading to 9:3:3:1 for the combined traits. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " \n\nSo for each gene, there's a 3:1 ratio if we consider dominance, but since each gene has two alleles, the actual phenotypic ratio per gene is:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- Presence: 2/3 (since C is dominant)\n- Absence: 1/3\n\nFor Color (B):\n- Presence: 2/3 (B is dominant)\n- Absence: 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is (2/3 * 2/3) : (2/3 * 1/3) : (1/3 * 2/3) : (1/3 * 1/3) = 4:2:2:1.\n\nWait, but I might have mixed up the order. Alternatively, thinking in terms of possible phenotypes:\n\nCheckered: when both genes are absent (c and b). Plain: either c (for C) or b (for B). Brown: either c (for C) or b (for B). Red: any combination where either C is present or B is present. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): phenotype is 'checkered' regardless of other traits.\n- Plain (c and b): same as above.\n- Brown (C and b): phenotype is 'brown'\n- Red (C and B): phenotype is 'red'\n\nBut wait, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes leads to the highest phenotype. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective phenotype. Let's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. C (present) and B (present): Phenotype is red (dominant for both).\n2. C (present) and B (absent): Phenotype is red (since C is dominant).\n3. C (absent) and B (present): Phenotype is brown (since B is dominant).\n4. C (absent) and B (absent): Phenotype is checkered (both recessive).\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: cases 1, 2, 3\n- Brown: case 3\n- Checkered: case 4\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nThe chance of having at least one dominant allele for C is 3/4 (since C is dominant, so 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4). Similarly, the chance for B is also 3/4. Assuming independence, the joint probabilities are 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for red (phenotype 1,2,3), 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 for brown (case 3), 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 for checkered (case 4), and 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for none (but that's not part of our options). \n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red: 9/16\n- Brown: 3/16\n- Checkered: 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3=15/16, leaving 1/16 unaccounted for (which is the case when both genes are recessive, leading to none of the above, but since we don't have that option, it's ignored). So, the phenotypic ratio among the four possible outcomes is 9:3:3:1, but since some outcomes don't appear (like none), we can say:\n\n- Red: 9 parts\n- Brown: 3 parts\n- Checkered: 3 parts\n- None: 1 part\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the observed phenotypes (Red, Brown, Checkered), so excluding the 'none' category, it's 9:3:3.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, let's see what each choice presents.\n\nOption D says: 1 checkered, 3 plain brown, 9 red, 3 brown. That doesn't match my calculation. Wait, according to my earlier breakdown, Red is 9 parts, Brown is 3, Checkered is 3. So the total would be 15, but perhaps the options scale differently. Maybe the options are scaled such that the sum equals 16, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let's double-check. The C gene determines pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). The B gene determines color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes leads to the highest phenotype.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele), and B is present (any B allele), then it's red.\n- If C is present and B is absent, it's red.\n- If C is absent and B is present, it's brown.\n- If both are absent, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are as follows:\n\nProbability of red = Probability(C present OR B present) = 1 - Probability(both absent) = 1 - (probability C absent * probability B absent) = 1 - ((1/4)*(1/4)) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nProbability of brown = Probability(B present AND C absent) = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nProbability of checkered = Probability(C absent AND B absent) = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the phenotypic distribution would be approximately 15:3:3, but scaled appropriately. However, the options presented do not include 15:3:3. Instead, they seem to present different ratios, possibly after scaling.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Sum is 16. So, 12 red, 2 brown, 2 checkered, 0 none. That adds up to 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12, but that sums to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Wait, no\u2014that's 1+3+9+3=16. But according to my calculations, red is 15/16, which would translate to 15 in a 16 population. But none of the options exactly match that except for Option G, which uses 12,2,2,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are simplified or rounded. Let me recalculate the exact probabilities:\n\nTotal possible genotypes for each bird:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% CB, 25% cb (wait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, producing gametes CB and cb in equal proportions.)\n\nWait, correcting myself: The F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering each gene separately, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nFor pigment C: dominant (C) over recessive (c). The proportion of C (red) would be 3/4, and c (plain) 1/4.\n\nFor color B: dominant (B) over recessive (b). Proportion of B (brown) 3/4, b (checkered) 1/4.\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the combined phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C dominant, B absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B dominant: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, but without the 'none' category, it's 9:3:3. So the phenotypic ratios among the observed categories (Red, Brown, Checkered) are 9:3:3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This sums to 16, which corresponds to 1 red, 3 brown, 9 checkered, 3 none. But according to our calculation, red is 9, brown 3, checkered 3. So, this matches option D. However, the option lists \"1,3,9,3,\" which could mean 1 red, 3 brown, 9 checkered, and 3 none. But our calculation shows that the sum is 16, which is accounted for by including the 'none' category, which isn't shown in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the options represent the number of individuals rather than percentages. If each F2 individual has a certain probability of being a particular phenotype, then the expected count would reflect those probabilities multiplied by the total number of offspring.\n\nIf the F2 population is 16 (assuming a 4x4 grid), then the expected counts would be:\n\n- 9 red\n- 3 brown\n- 3 checkered\n- 1 none\n\nWhich aligns with option D: 1,3,9,3. But option D's numbers add up to 16, matching the total. So, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 red, 3 brown, 3 checkered, and 1 none. Thus, the correct answer should reflect this ratio, which is option D.\n\nWait, but option D says: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems reversed. Because according to our calculation, checkered (c and b) is 3, red (C and B) is 9, brown (B) is 3, and none is 1. So option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Assuming independence, the joint probabilities are 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for red (phenotype 1,2,3), 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 for brown (case 3), 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 for checkered (case 4), and 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for none (but that's not part of our options). \n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red: 9/16\n- Brown: 3/16\n- Checkered: 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3=15/16, leaving 1/16 unaccounted for (which is the case when both genes are recessive, leading to none of the above, but since we don't have that option, it's ignored). So, the phenotypic ratio among the four possible outcomes is 9:3:3:1, but since some outcomes don't appear (like none), we can say:\n\n- Red: 9 parts\n- Brown: 3 parts\n- Checkered: 3 parts\n- None: 1 part\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the observed phenotypes (Red, Brown, Checkered), so excluding the 'none' category, it's 9:3:3.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, let's see what each choice presents.\n\nOption D says: 1 checkered, 3 plain brown, 9 red, 3 brown. That doesn't match my calculation. Wait, according to my earlier breakdown, Red is 9 parts, Brown is 3, Checkered is 3. So the total would be 15, but perhaps the options scale differently. Maybe the options are scaled such that the sum equals 16, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let's double-check. The C gene determines pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). The B gene determines color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes leads to the highest phenotype.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele), and B is present (any B allele), then it's red.\n- If C is present and B is absent, it's red.\n- If C is absent and B is present, it's brown.\n- If both are absent, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are as follows:\n\nProbability of red = Probability(C present OR B present) = 1 - Probability(both absent) = 1 - (probability C absent * probability B absent) = 1 - ((1/4)*(1/4)) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nProbability of brown = Probability(B present AND C absent) = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nProbability of checkered = Probability(C absent AND B absent) = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the phenotypic distribution would be approximately 15:3:3, but scaled appropriately. However, the options presented do not include 15:3:3. Instead, they seem to present different ratios, possibly after scaling.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Sum is 16. So, 12 red, 2 brown, 2 checkered, 0 none. That adds up to 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12, but that sums to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Wait, no\u2014that's 1+3+9+3=16. But according to my calculations, red is 15/16, which would translate to 15 in a 16 population. But none of the options exactly match that except for Option G, which uses 12,2,2,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are simplified or rounded. Let me recalculate the exact probabilities:\n\nTotal possible genotypes for each bird:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% CB, 25% cb (wait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, producing gametes CB and cb in equal proportions.)\n\nWait, correcting myself: The F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering each gene separately, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nFor pigment C: dominant (C) over recessive (c). The proportion of C (red) would be 3/4, and c (plain) 1/4.\n\nFor color B: dominant (B) over recessive (b). Proportion of B (brown) 3/4, b (checkered) 1/4.\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the combined phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C dominant, B absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B dominant: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, but without the 'none' category, it's 9:3:3. So the phenotypic ratios among the observed categories (Red, Brown, Checkered) are 9:3:3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This sums to 16, which corresponds to 1 red, 3 brown, 9 checkered, 3 none. But according to our calculation, red is 9, brown 3, checkered 3. So, this matches option D. However, the option lists \"1,3,9,3,\" which could mean 1 red, 3 brown, 9 checkered, and 3 none. But our calculation shows that the sum is 16, which is accounted for by including the 'none' category, which isn't shown in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the options represent the number of individuals rather than percentages. If each F2 individual has a certain probability of being a particular phenotype, then the expected count would reflect those probabilities multiplied by the total number of offspring.\n\nIf the F2 population is 16 (assuming a 4x4 grid), then the expected counts would be:\n\n- 9 red\n- 3 brown\n- 3 checkered\n- 1 none\n\nWhich aligns with option D: 1,3,9,3. But option D's numbers add up to 16, matching the total. So, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 red, 3 brown, 3 checkered, and 1 none. Thus, the correct answer should reflect this ratio, which is option D.\n\nWait, but option D says: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems reversed. Because according to our calculation, checkered (c and b) is 3, red (C and B) is 9, brown (B) is 3, and none is 1. So option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Using a Punnett square:\n\n- From CC (red pigment) and CC (brown color): Checkered red.\n- From CC (red) and Cc (checkered): Checkered brown.\n- From Cc (checkered) and CC: Checkered red.\n- From Cc (checkered) and Cc: Checkered brown.\n- From cc (plain pigment) and BB (brown): Plain brown.\n- From cc and Bb: Plain brown.\n- From cc and cb: Plain brown.\n- From cc and cc: Plain checkered.\n- From bb (checkered) and BB: Plain brown.\n- From bb and Bb: Plain brown.\n- From bb and cb: Plain brown.\n- From bb and bb: Plain checkered.\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: appears when both genes are dominant (from CC x CC and Cc x Cc), so 25% + 25% = 50%?\nWait, no, because:\n\nLooking at the F2:\n\nFrom CC (red pigment) \u00d7 CC (brown color):\n- All are checkered red.\n\nFrom CC \u00d7 Cc:\n- Checkered brown.\n\nFrom Cc \u00d7 CC:\n- Checkered red.\n\nFrom Cc \u00d7 Cc:\n- Checkered brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 BB:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 Bb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 cb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 cc:\n- Plain checkered.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 BB:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 Bb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 cb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 bb:\n- Plain checkered.\n\nSo now, count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: occurs in cases where both genes are dominant. In the F2 grid, checkered red appears when both parents contribute C and B. That happens in 25% of the cases (from CC x BB?), wait no\u2014it's more complex. Actually, in the F2 grid, the checkered red phenotype is present in the top-left quadrant, which corresponds to the 25% where both genes are dominant. Similarly, checkered brown is in the top-right quadrant, which is another 25%. Plain red is in the bottom-left, another 25%. Plain brown is in the bottom-right, another 25%. So total:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nBut according to standard dihybrid crosses, without any epistasis, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, leading to 75% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, etc. Wait, but our calculation shows each phenotype at 25%, which doesn't align with standard expectations unless there's an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC (red pigment) \u00d7 CC (brown color) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 BB (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 cb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 cc (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered\n9. bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 BB (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n10. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n11. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 cb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n12. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSo now, checking each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 3, 4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Case 12 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 \u2192 5 cases\n\nWait, that totals 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11 cases, but F2 should have 16 (since each parent contributes 4 gametes). Hmm, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) produces 4 gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but since each parent is homozygous, the gametes are always CB and cb. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 comes from F1 selfing, producing 16 possible gametes: 4 from each parent's gametes. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then each gamete is either CB or cb, each occurring 50% of the time. So F2 will have 16 possible gametes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but actually, the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion. So when F1 selfs, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. So the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because if F1 is CcBb, then the gametes are CB and cb, each 50% of the time. So F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes in the F2, each with 25% frequency. But how does this translate into the phenotypic ratios?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Instead of thinking in terms of gametes, use a Punnett square where the possible F2 genotypes are considered. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (dominant)\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc (dominant)\n\nAnd,\n\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc\n\nFinally,\n\n- bb \u00d7 CC \u2192 bb\n- bb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 bb\n- bb \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb\n\nSo compiling all the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: 1/4\n- Cc: 2/4 (from CC\u00d7Cc and Cc\u00d7CC)\n- cc: 1/4\n- bb: 1/4\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- For pigment color (C): \n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- For color (B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each genotype will determine the phenotype. Let's consider each genotype:\n\n1. CC (red pigment) \u00d7 BB (brown color) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Plain checkered\n9. bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Plain brown\n10. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n11. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Plain brown\n12. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- Checkered red: Only case 1 \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,3,4 \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: None, since all checkered for pigment\n- Plain brown: Cases 5,6,7,10,11 \u2192 5/16\n- Plain checkered: Cases 8,12 \u2192 2/16\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 11, but the total should be 16. Wait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nCheckered red: 1 case (1/16)\nCheckered brown: 3 cases (3/16)\nPlain red: 0\nPlain brown: 5 cases (5/16)\nPlain checkered: 2 cases (2/16)\nTotal: 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 11, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at it differently. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Plain red\n4. Plain brown\n\nBut according to the counts above, it's 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 11, which suggests an error. Let me try again:\n\nThe correct breakdown should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (case 1)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (cases 2,3,4)\n- Plain red: 0\n- Plain brown: 5 (cases 5,6,7,10,11)\n- Plain checkered: 2 (cases 8,12)\n\nThat sums to 1 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 11, which still doesn't add up to 16. This discrepancy indicates I must have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 CC (brown) \u2192 Checkered red (1 case)\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown (1 case)\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 cc (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n4. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 bb (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n5. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 CC (red) \u2192 Checkered brown (1 case)\n6. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown (1 case)\n7. Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 cc (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n8. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 bb (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n9. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 CC (red) \u2192 Plain red (1 case)\n10. cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered (1 case)\n11. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 cc (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered (1 case)\n12. bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 BB (red) \u2192 Plain red (1 case)\n13. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown (1 case)\n14. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 cb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown (1 case)\n15. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered (1 case)\n\nWait, that makes sense now. Each F2 genotype leads to a specific phenotype, so the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (case 1)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (case 2) + 1 (case 6) = 2\n- Plain red: 1 (case 9) + 1 (case 12) = 2\n- Plain brown: 1 (case 5) + 1 (case 13) + 1 (case 14) + 1 (case 15) = 4\n- Checkered checkered: 1 (case 8) + 1 (case 10) + 1 (case 11) + 1 (case 14) + 1 (case 15) = 5\n\nWait, that adds up to 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 14, which is still missing one case. Perhaps I missed some cases. Alternatively, perhaps the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 case\n- Checkered brown: 2 cases\n- Plain red: 2 cases\n- Plain brown: 4 cases\n- Checkered checkered: 9 cases\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier approach. I think I need to clarify this by recalculating the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes properly.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|-----------|------------|\n| CC \u00d7 CC | Checkered red |\n| CC \u00d7 Cc | Checkered brown |\n| CC \u00d7 cc | Checkered plain |\n| CC \u00d7 bb | Checkered plain |\n| Cc \u00d7 CC | Checkered brown |\n| Cc \u00d7 Cc | Checkered brown |\n| Cc \u00d7 cc | Checkered plain |\n| Cc \u00d7 bb | Checkered plain |\n| cc \u00d7 CC | Plain red |\n| cc \u00d7 Cc | Plain checkered |\n| cc \u00d7 cc | Plain checkered |\n| bb \u00d7 BB | Plain brown |\n| bb \u00d7 Bb | Plain brown |\n| bb \u00d7 cb | Plain brown |\n| bb \u00d7 bb | Plain checkered |\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nThis adds up to 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 11. Where am I going wrong? There must be 16 cases, so I'm missing five. Let me recount:\n\nPerhaps I missed the cases where the other gene is present. For example, when C is present, regardless of B, it's checkered. Similarly, when b is present, regardless of C, it's plain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: only when C is present and B is absent \u2192 1 case (CC \u00d7 bb)\n- Checkered brown: when C is present and B is present \u2192 2 cases (CC \u00d7 Bb and Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n- Checkered plain: when C is absent \u2192 3 cases (cc \u00d7 anything)\n- Plain red: when c is present and B is absent \u2192 1 case (cc \u00d7 bb)\n- Plain brown: when c is present and B is present \u2192 4 cases (bb \u00d7 BB, Bb, cb, bb \u00d7 Bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:3:1:4. Converting to ratios, it's 1:2:3:1:4. To make it a sum of 16, we can write it as 1:2:3:1:4, which adds to 11. Wait, that can't be right. There must be 16 cases. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each F2 individual is a unique combination of gametes. There are 16 possible gametes from F1, each resulting in a unique genotype and phenotype. So, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (only CC \u00d7 bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (CC \u00d7 Bb and Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n- Checkered plain: 3 (cc \u00d7 anything)\n- Plain red: 1 (",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) Each gene has a 3:1 ratio? No, wait: If the parents are homozygous and heterozygous, the F1 would be CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross. The F1 would produce gametes that are either CB or cb, each at 50%. So the F2 would have the following phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (red) : 75%\n- Absence (plain) : 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (brown) : 75%\n- Absence (checkered) : 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined phenotype ratios are the product of each individual ratio. So 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25%, 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75%, 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%, and 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%. To express these as whole numbers, we can scale up by 16, giving us 9:4:4:1. Adding them together, 9+4+4+1=18. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 checkered red : 4 checkered brown : 4 plain red : 1 plain brown.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options given:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. It seems the user might have made a mistake in their options. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F1 is incorrect. Wait, going back: the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Thus, F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions. So the F2 would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Now, considering dominance:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Present: red (phenotype)\n- Absent: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- Present: brown\n- Absent: checkered\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two traits. Using a Punnett square:\n\n- From CC (red pigment) and CC (brown color): Checkered red.\n- From CC (red) and Cc (checkered): Checkered brown.\n- From Cc (checkered) and CC: Checkered red.\n- From Cc (checkered) and Cc: Checkered brown.\n- From cc (plain pigment) and BB (brown): Plain brown.\n- From cc and Bb: Plain brown.\n- From cc and cb: Plain brown.\n- From cc and cc: Plain checkered.\n- From bb (checkered) and BB: Plain brown.\n- From bb and Bb: Plain brown.\n- From bb and cb: Plain brown.\n- From bb and bb: Plain checkered.\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: appears when both genes are dominant (from CC x CC and Cc x Cc), so 25% + 25% = 50%?\nWait, no, because:\n\nLooking at the F2:\n\nFrom CC (red pigment) \u00d7 CC (brown color):\n- All are checkered red.\n\nFrom CC \u00d7 Cc:\n- Checkered brown.\n\nFrom Cc \u00d7 CC:\n- Checkered red.\n\nFrom Cc \u00d7 Cc:\n- Checkered brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 BB:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 Bb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 cb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom cc \u00d7 cc:\n- Plain checkered.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 BB:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 Bb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 cb:\n- Plain brown.\n\nFrom bb \u00d7 bb:\n- Plain checkered.\n\nSo now, count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: occurs in cases where both genes are dominant. In the F2 grid, checkered red appears when both parents contribute C and B. That happens in 25% of the cases (from CC x BB?), wait no\u2014it's more complex. Actually, in the F2 grid, the checkered red phenotype is present in the top-left quadrant, which corresponds to the 25% where both genes are dominant. Similarly, checkered brown is in the top-right quadrant, which is another 25%. Plain red is in the bottom-left, another 25%. Plain brown is in the bottom-right, another 25%. So total:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nBut according to standard dihybrid crosses, without any epistasis, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, leading to 75% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, etc. Wait, but our calculation shows each phenotype at 25%, which doesn't align with standard expectations unless there's an error in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC (red pigment) \u00d7 CC (brown color) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 BB (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 cb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 cc (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered\n9. bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 BB (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n10. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n11. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 cb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n12. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb (checkered) \u00d7 bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSo now, checking each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 3, 4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Case 12 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 \u2192 5 cases\n\nWait, that totals 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11 cases, but F2 should have 16 (since each parent contributes 4 gametes). Hmm, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) produces 4 gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but since each parent is homozygous, the gametes are always CB and cb. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 comes from F1 selfing, producing 16 possible gametes: 4 from each parent's gametes. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then each gamete is either CB or cb, each occurring 50% of the time. So F2 will have 16 possible gametes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but actually, the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion. So when F1 selfs, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. So the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because if F1 is CcBb, then the gametes are CB and cb, each 50% of the time. So F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes in the F2, each with 25% frequency. But how does this translate into the phenotypic ratios?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Instead of thinking in terms of gametes, use a Punnett square where the possible F2 genotypes are considered. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (dominant)\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc (dominant)\n\nAnd,\n\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc\n\nFinally,\n\n- bb \u00d7 CC \u2192 bb\n- bb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 bb\n- bb \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb\n\nSo compiling all the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: 1/4\n- Cc: 2/4 (from CC\u00d7Cc and Cc\u00d7CC)\n- cc: 1/4\n- bb: 1/4\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- For pigment color (C): \n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- For color (B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each genotype will determine the phenotype. Let's consider each genotype:\n\n1. CC (red pigment) \u00d7 BB (brown color) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Plain checkered\n9. bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Plain brown\n10. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n11. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Plain brown\n12. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- Checkered red: Only case 1 \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,3,4 \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: None, since all checkered for pigment\n- Plain brown: Cases 5,6,7,10,11 \u2192 5/16\n- Plain checkered: Cases 8,12 \u2192 2/16\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 11, but the total should be 16. Wait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nCheckered red: 1 case (1/16)\nCheckered brown: 3 cases (3/16)\nPlain red: 0\nPlain brown: 5 cases (5/16)\nPlain checkered: 2 cases (2/16)\nTotal: 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 11, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at it differently. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Plain red\n4. Plain brown\n\nBut according to the counts above, it's 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 11, which suggests an error. Let me try again:\n\nThe correct breakdown should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (case 1)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (cases 2,3,4)\n- Plain red: 0\n- Plain brown: 5 (cases 5,6,7,10,11)\n- Plain checkered: 2 (cases 8,12)\n\nThat sums to 1 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 11, which still doesn't add up to 16. This discrepancy indicates I must have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 CC (brown) \u2192 Checkered red (1 case)\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown (1 case)\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 cc (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n4. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC (red) \u00d7 bb (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n5. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 CC (red) \u2192 Checkered brown (1 case)\n6. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown (1 case)\n7. Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 cc (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n8. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc (checkered) \u00d7 bb (plain) \u2192 Checkered plain (1 case)\n9. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 CC (red) \u2192 Plain red (1 case)\n10. cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 Cc (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered (1 case)\n11. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc (plain) \u00d7 cc (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered (1 case)\n12. bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 BB (red) \u2192 Plain red (1 case)\n13. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown (1 case)\n14. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 cb (brown) \u2192 Plain brown (1 case)\n15. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb (plain) \u00d7 bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain checkered (1 case)\n\nWait, that makes sense now. Each F2 genotype leads to a specific phenotype, so the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (case 1)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (case 2) + 1 (case 6) = 2\n- Plain red: 1 (case 9) + 1 (case 12) = 2\n- Plain brown: 1 (case 5) + 1 (case 13) + 1 (case 14) + 1 (case 15) = 4\n- Checkered checkered: 1 (case 8) + 1 (case 10) + 1 (case 11) + 1 (case 14) + 1 (case 15) = 5\n\nWait, that adds up to 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 14, which is still missing one case. Perhaps I missed some cases. Alternatively, perhaps the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 case\n- Checkered brown: 2 cases\n- Plain red: 2 cases\n- Plain brown: 4 cases\n- Checkered checkered: 9 cases\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier approach. I think I need to clarify this by recalculating the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes properly.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|-----------|------------|\n| CC \u00d7 CC | Checkered red |\n| CC \u00d7 Cc | Checkered brown |\n| CC \u00d7 cc | Checkered plain |\n| CC \u00d7 bb | Checkered plain |\n| Cc \u00d7 CC | Checkered brown |\n| Cc \u00d7 Cc | Checkered brown |\n| Cc \u00d7 cc | Checkered plain |\n| Cc \u00d7 bb | Checkered plain |\n| cc \u00d7 CC | Plain red |\n| cc \u00d7 Cc | Plain checkered |\n| cc \u00d7 cc | Plain checkered |\n| bb \u00d7 BB | Plain brown |\n| bb \u00d7 Bb | Plain brown |\n| bb \u00d7 cb | Plain brown |\n| bb \u00d7 bb | Plain checkered |\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nThis adds up to 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 11. Where am I going wrong? There must be 16 cases, so I'm missing five. Let me recount:\n\nPerhaps I missed the cases where the other gene is present. For example, when C is present, regardless of B, it's checkered. Similarly, when b is present, regardless of C, it's plain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: only when C is present and B is absent \u2192 1 case (CC \u00d7 bb)\n- Checkered brown: when C is present and B is present \u2192 2 cases (CC \u00d7 Bb and Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n- Checkered plain: when C is absent \u2192 3 cases (cc \u00d7 anything)\n- Plain red: when c is present and B is absent \u2192 1 case (cc \u00d7 bb)\n- Plain brown: when c is present and B is present \u2192 4 cases (bb \u00d7 BB, Bb, cb, bb \u00d7 Bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:3:1:4. Converting to ratios, it's 1:2:3:1:4. To make it a sum of 16, we can write it as 1:2:3:1:4, which adds to 11. Wait, that can't be right. There must be 16 cases. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each F2 individual is a unique combination of gametes. There are 16 possible gametes from F1, each resulting in a unique genotype and phenotype. So, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (only CC \u00d7 bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (CC \u00d7 Bb and Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n- Checkered plain: 3 (cc \u00d7 anything)\n- Plain red: 1 (",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for the C locus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since C is dominant over c), and similarly for the B locus, it's also 3:1.",
    "rollout": " \n\nSo for the C locus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since C is dominant over c), and similarly for the B locus, it's also 3:1. But since the genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for each phenotype. Wait, but how many phenotypes are there? Let's list them:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_), which would be red brown\n2. C dominant (C_B_), which is red brown if B is present\nWait, no, perhaps better to consider each gene separately.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a clearer approach: Each gene contributes to the phenotype independently. So for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C: pigment color is red\n- Absence of C: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B: brown\n- Absence of B: checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the number of phenotypes is 3 * 3 = 9. Each combination of presence or absence for each gene results in a unique phenotype.\n\nNow, the F2 population will have the following phenotypic distribution based on the F2 genotypes. Let's map the F2 genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFrom earlier, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor each of these, we determine the phenotype based on the presence of C and B.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. CC (C present):\n   - Checkered (since c is recessive)\n   - Brown (since B is dominant)\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n2. Cc (C present):\n   - Checkered (c)\n   - Brown (B dominant)\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n3. cc (c absent):\n   - Plain (since c is recessive)\n   - Brown (B dominant)\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. CC (again, same as above)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me clarify: Each genotype maps directly to a phenotype based on dominance. So for each F2 genotype, we look at whether C is present (so checkered or red) and whether B is present (brown or checkered).\n\nSo:\n\n- CC (both C and B dominant): Checkered Brown\n- Cc (either C dominant or B dominant): Checkered Brown (since C is dominant, regardless of B)\n- cc (C recessive, B dominant): Plain Brown\n- cc (C recessive, B recessive): Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of both dominant alleles leads to the highest phenotype. So, for example:\n\n- CC_B_: Checkered Brown\n- Cc_B_: Checkered Brown\n- CC_bb: Checkered Checkered\n- Cc_bb: Checkered Checkered\n- cc_B_: Plain Brown\n- cc_bb: Plain Checkered\n\nBut in terms of probability, each combination's probability is multiplied together. So, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (25%) \u00d7 B_ (75%) = 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc (50%) \u00d7 B_ (75%) = 50% \u00d7 75% = 37.5% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 B_ (75%) = 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc (50%) \u00d7 bb (25%) = 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5% \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 bb (25%) = 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but in the previous calculation, the checkered phenotype comes from either having C (regardless of B) or having B (even if not C). So the total percentage for Checkered Brown is the sum of CC_B_ and Cc_B_, which is 25% + 50% = 75%, but adjusted for the probability of B being present.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since for each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So for each F2 genotype, the chance depends on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. CC (C present, always):\n   - Probability: 25%\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n   - So contribution: 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n\n2. Cc (C present, B present):\n   - Probability: 50% (since Cc is 50%)\n   - So contribution: 50% \u00d7 75% = 37.5%\n\n3. cc (C absent, B present):\n   - Probability: 25%\n   - Contribution: 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. cc (C absent, B absent):\n   - Probability: 25%\n   - Contribution: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding up the contributions:\n\nCheckered Brown: 18.75% + 37.5% = 56.25%\nPlain Brown: 18.75%\nCheckered Checkered: 6.25%\nPlain Checkered: 6.25%\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 100% because 56.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 87.5%. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, because I forgot that the presence of B is checked in the genotype. Wait, no\u2014the presence of B is part of the phenotype. So, for each F2 genotype, we must assess both genes. Let me re-express:\n\nEach F2 genotype has a certain probability, and within that, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant. For example:\n\n- CC (25%):\n   - C is dominant \u2192 Checkered\n   - B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n- Cc (50%):\n   - C is dominant \u2192 Checkered\n   - B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n- cc (25%):\n   - C is recessive \u2192 Plain\n   - B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n- cc (25%):\n   - C is recessive \u2192 Plain\n   - B is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nSo, calculating the percentages:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (25% CC) + (50% Cc) = 75% of F2\n   \u2192 75% \u00d7 probability of B being present (75%)?\nWait, no\u2014it's the product of each gene's probability leading to the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, the overall percentage for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (Probability CC) + (Probability Cc) = 75% of F2 \u2192 75% \u00d7 100% = 75% \u2192 75% of F2 is Checkered Brown.\n- Plain Brown: (Probability cc) \u00d7 (Probability B present) = 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% of F2.\n- Checkered Checkered: (Probability cc) \u00d7 (Probability B absent) = 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% of F2.\n- Plain Checkered: (Probability cc) \u00d7 (Probability B absent) = 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% of F2.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 75% (0.75)\n- Plain Brown: 18.75% (0.1875)\n- Checkered Checkered: 6.25% (0.0625)\n- Plain Checkered: 6.25% (0.0625)\n\nTotal: 75 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 106.25% \u2192 Wait, that's over 100%. That suggests I made a mistake.\n\nAh, I see. Because the presence of dominant alleles leads to the higher phenotype, and the recessive leads to lower. So perhaps I should calculate the probability that each gene is dominant for each phenotype.\n\nLet me approach it differently. For each F2 genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown:\n   - At least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B.\n   \u2192 This includes CC_B_, CC_bb, Cc_B_, Cc_bb\n   \u2192 Probabilities:\n      - CC_B_: 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n      - CC_bb: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n      Total: 25% \u00d7 75% + 25% \u00d7 25% = 18.75 + 6.25 = 25% \u2192 Wait, that seems off.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because the presence of both dominant alleles leads to the highest phenotype. So:\n\n- For Checkered Brown (C_B_):\n   - Either C present and B present \u2192 75% of F2\n   - Or C present and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 Total: 75% of F2\n\n- For Plain Brown (c_B_):\n   - C absent and B present \u2192 25% of F2\n   - C absent and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 Total: 50% of F2\n\n- For Checkered Checkered (c_b_):\n   - C absent and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   - C present and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 Total: 50% of F2\n\n- For Plain Checkered (c_b_):\n   - C absent and B present \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 25% of F2\n\nWait, now adding these up: 75% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 200% \u2192 Still too high. I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to compute the probability of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Brown (C_B_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability C is present) \u00d7 (Probability B is present)\n   - Probability C is present = 1 - (Probability cc) = 1 - (25% F2) = 75%\n   - Probability B is present = 1 - (Probability bb) = 1 - (25% F2) = 75%\n   - So, 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n2. **Plain Brown (c_B_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability c is present) \u00d7 (Probability B is present)\n   - Probability c is present = 25% F2\n   - Probability B is present = 75%\n   - So, 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\n3. **Checkered Checkered (c_b_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability c is present) \u00d7 (Probability b is present)\n   - Probability c is present = 25% F2\n   - Probability b is present = 25% F2\n   - So, 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\n4. **Plain Checkered (c_b_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability c is present) \u00d7 (Probability b is present)\n   - Which is the same as above: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdding these: 56.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 87.5% \u2192 Hmm, still missing 2.5%.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. In the F2 generation, some phenotypes might overlap, but according to the calculations, the total percentage is 87.5%, leaving 2.5% unaccounted. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a Punnett square approach, considering all possible gametes and their combinations. Let me try that.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Each gene segregates independently. So, for the C locus, the gametes are CB and cb (each 50%). For the B locus, the gametes are Bb (which breaks into B and b, but in reality, each gamete is either B or b, each 50%).\n\nWait, no\u2014for the B locus, the alleles are B and b, so each gamete has a 50% chance of being B or b.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have gametes formed by combining one C/B gamete and one c/b gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes should include CB and cb. Therefore, F2 genotypes should be:\n\n- 25% CC_B_ (if both gametes are CB)\n- 25% CcBb (if one gamete is CB and the other cb)\n- 25% ccBb (if both gametes are cb)\n- 25% cc_b_ (if one gamete is cb and the other cb)\n\nWait, no, because CB and cb are the gametes, so the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB) \u2192 CC BB\n- 25% (CB x cb) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x CB) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x cb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, that's different than what I thought before. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - C present \u2192 Checkered\n   - B present \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n2. Cc Bb:\n   - C present \u2192 Checkered\n   - B present \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n3. cc bb:\n   - C absent \u2192 Plain\n   - B absent \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25% + 50% = 75% \u2192 Wait, no\u2014only 75% of F2 is Checkered Brown, and 25% is Plain Checkered.\n\nSo, the ratio is Checkered Brown : Plain Checkered = 75% : 25% = 3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That's a 12:2:2:2 ratio, which adds up to 18 parts, not 16. Not matching our 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, 5+3=8, 2+6=8, total 16. Ratio 5:3:2:6. Doesn't fit our 3:1.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16 parts, ratio 6:2:6:2. Simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which fits our 3:1 but scaled up.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16 parts. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Simplifies to 3:9:1:3, which isn't a clean 3:1.\n\nOption D: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1, which is different from our 3:1.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match my conclusion. Option A scales my 3:1 ratio to 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16, and the phenotypes correspond to the counts. But looking at option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. So Checkered Brown is 6, Plain Brown is 2, Checkered Red is 6, Plain Red is 2. That totals 16, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. So it matches.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I had 12 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Brown, 2 Checkered Red, 2 Plain Red, that's 20, which is incorrect because the total should be 16. So scaling factor is 16 divided by 16, giving 12:2:2:2, which is 3:1:3:1. Thus, option A: Checkered Red 6, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Red 6, Plain Brown 2. That's 6+2+6+2=16, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 3:1:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option A is labeled as \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Yes, that fits.\n\nWait, but hold on. The F2 phenotypic ratio was 75% Checkered Brown and 25% Plain Checkered. So the actual count should reflect that. If we assume the F2 population is 16 individuals, then 75% would be 12 Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Checkered would be 4. But none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, if the F2 population is larger, say 16, then option A is correct. If the F2 population is 16, option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the F2",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) \n\nSo for the C locus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since C is dominant over c), and similarly for the B locus, it's also 3:1. But since the genes are independent, the combined phenotype ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for each phenotype. Wait, but how many phenotypes are there? Let's list them:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_), which would be red brown\n2. C dominant (C_B_), which is red brown if B is present\nWait, no, perhaps better to consider each gene separately.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a clearer approach: Each gene contributes to the phenotype independently. So for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C: pigment color is red\n- Absence of C: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B: brown\n- Absence of B: checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the number of phenotypes is 3 * 3 = 9. Each combination of presence or absence for each gene results in a unique phenotype.\n\nNow, the F2 population will have the following phenotypic distribution based on the F2 genotypes. Let's map the F2 genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFrom earlier, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor each of these, we determine the phenotype based on the presence of C and B.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. CC (C present):\n   - Checkered (since c is recessive)\n   - Brown (since B is dominant)\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n2. Cc (C present):\n   - Checkered (c)\n   - Brown (B dominant)\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n3. cc (c absent):\n   - Plain (since c is recessive)\n   - Brown (B dominant)\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. CC (again, same as above)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me clarify: Each genotype maps directly to a phenotype based on dominance. So for each F2 genotype, we look at whether C is present (so checkered or red) and whether B is present (brown or checkered).\n\nSo:\n\n- CC (both C and B dominant): Checkered Brown\n- Cc (either C dominant or B dominant): Checkered Brown (since C is dominant, regardless of B)\n- cc (C recessive, B dominant): Plain Brown\n- cc (C recessive, B recessive): Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of both dominant alleles leads to the highest phenotype. So, for example:\n\n- CC_B_: Checkered Brown\n- Cc_B_: Checkered Brown\n- CC_bb: Checkered Checkered\n- Cc_bb: Checkered Checkered\n- cc_B_: Plain Brown\n- cc_bb: Plain Checkered\n\nBut in terms of probability, each combination's probability is multiplied together. So, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (25%) \u00d7 B_ (75%) = 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc (50%) \u00d7 B_ (75%) = 50% \u00d7 75% = 37.5% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 B_ (75%) = 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc (50%) \u00d7 bb (25%) = 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5% \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 bb (25%) = 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but in the previous calculation, the checkered phenotype comes from either having C (regardless of B) or having B (even if not C). So the total percentage for Checkered Brown is the sum of CC_B_ and Cc_B_, which is 25% + 50% = 75%, but adjusted for the probability of B being present.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since for each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So for each F2 genotype, the chance depends on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. CC (C present, always):\n   - Probability: 25%\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n   - So contribution: 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n\n2. Cc (C present, B present):\n   - Probability: 50% (since Cc is 50%)\n   - So contribution: 50% \u00d7 75% = 37.5%\n\n3. cc (C absent, B present):\n   - Probability: 25%\n   - Contribution: 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. cc (C absent, B absent):\n   - Probability: 25%\n   - Contribution: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding up the contributions:\n\nCheckered Brown: 18.75% + 37.5% = 56.25%\nPlain Brown: 18.75%\nCheckered Checkered: 6.25%\nPlain Checkered: 6.25%\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 100% because 56.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 87.5%. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, because I forgot that the presence of B is checked in the genotype. Wait, no\u2014the presence of B is part of the phenotype. So, for each F2 genotype, we must assess both genes. Let me re-express:\n\nEach F2 genotype has a certain probability, and within that, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant. For example:\n\n- CC (25%):\n   - C is dominant \u2192 Checkered\n   - B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n- Cc (50%):\n   - C is dominant \u2192 Checkered\n   - B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n- cc (25%):\n   - C is recessive \u2192 Plain\n   - B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n- cc (25%):\n   - C is recessive \u2192 Plain\n   - B is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nSo, calculating the percentages:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (25% CC) + (50% Cc) = 75% of F2\n   \u2192 75% \u00d7 probability of B being present (75%)?\nWait, no\u2014it's the product of each gene's probability leading to the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, the overall percentage for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (Probability CC) + (Probability Cc) = 75% of F2 \u2192 75% \u00d7 100% = 75% \u2192 75% of F2 is Checkered Brown.\n- Plain Brown: (Probability cc) \u00d7 (Probability B present) = 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% of F2.\n- Checkered Checkered: (Probability cc) \u00d7 (Probability B absent) = 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% of F2.\n- Plain Checkered: (Probability cc) \u00d7 (Probability B absent) = 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% of F2.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 75% (0.75)\n- Plain Brown: 18.75% (0.1875)\n- Checkered Checkered: 6.25% (0.0625)\n- Plain Checkered: 6.25% (0.0625)\n\nTotal: 75 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 106.25% \u2192 Wait, that's over 100%. That suggests I made a mistake.\n\nAh, I see. Because the presence of dominant alleles leads to the higher phenotype, and the recessive leads to lower. So perhaps I should calculate the probability that each gene is dominant for each phenotype.\n\nLet me approach it differently. For each F2 genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown:\n   - At least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B.\n   \u2192 This includes CC_B_, CC_bb, Cc_B_, Cc_bb\n   \u2192 Probabilities:\n      - CC_B_: 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n      - CC_bb: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n      Total: 25% \u00d7 75% + 25% \u00d7 25% = 18.75 + 6.25 = 25% \u2192 Wait, that seems off.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because the presence of both dominant alleles leads to the highest phenotype. So:\n\n- For Checkered Brown (C_B_):\n   - Either C present and B present \u2192 75% of F2\n   - Or C present and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 Total: 75% of F2\n\n- For Plain Brown (c_B_):\n   - C absent and B present \u2192 25% of F2\n   - C absent and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 Total: 50% of F2\n\n- For Checkered Checkered (c_b_):\n   - C absent and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   - C present and B absent \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 Total: 50% of F2\n\n- For Plain Checkered (c_b_):\n   - C absent and B present \u2192 25% of F2\n   \u2192 25% of F2\n\nWait, now adding these up: 75% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 200% \u2192 Still too high. I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to compute the probability of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Brown (C_B_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability C is present) \u00d7 (Probability B is present)\n   - Probability C is present = 1 - (Probability cc) = 1 - (25% F2) = 75%\n   - Probability B is present = 1 - (Probability bb) = 1 - (25% F2) = 75%\n   - So, 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n2. **Plain Brown (c_B_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability c is present) \u00d7 (Probability B is present)\n   - Probability c is present = 25% F2\n   - Probability B is present = 75%\n   - So, 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\n3. **Checkered Checkered (c_b_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability c is present) \u00d7 (Probability b is present)\n   - Probability c is present = 25% F2\n   - Probability b is present = 25% F2\n   - So, 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\n4. **Plain Checkered (c_b_)**:\n   - Probability = (Probability c is present) \u00d7 (Probability b is present)\n   - Which is the same as above: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdding these: 56.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 87.5% \u2192 Hmm, still missing 2.5%.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. In the F2 generation, some phenotypes might overlap, but according to the calculations, the total percentage is 87.5%, leaving 2.5% unaccounted. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a Punnett square approach, considering all possible gametes and their combinations. Let me try that.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Each gene segregates independently. So, for the C locus, the gametes are CB and cb (each 50%). For the B locus, the gametes are Bb (which breaks into B and b, but in reality, each gamete is either B or b, each 50%).\n\nWait, no\u2014for the B locus, the alleles are B and b, so each gamete has a 50% chance of being B or b.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have gametes formed by combining one C/B gamete and one c/b gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes should include CB and cb. Therefore, F2 genotypes should be:\n\n- 25% CC_B_ (if both gametes are CB)\n- 25% CcBb (if one gamete is CB and the other cb)\n- 25% ccBb (if both gametes are cb)\n- 25% cc_b_ (if one gamete is cb and the other cb)\n\nWait, no, because CB and cb are the gametes, so the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB) \u2192 CC BB\n- 25% (CB x cb) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x CB) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x cb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, that's different than what I thought before. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - C present \u2192 Checkered\n   - B present \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n2. Cc Bb:\n   - C present \u2192 Checkered\n   - B present \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n3. cc bb:\n   - C absent \u2192 Plain\n   - B absent \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25% + 50% = 75% \u2192 Wait, no\u2014only 75% of F2 is Checkered Brown, and 25% is Plain Checkered.\n\nSo, the ratio is Checkered Brown : Plain Checkered = 75% : 25% = 3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That's a 12:2:2:2 ratio, which adds up to 18 parts, not 16. Not matching our 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, 5+3=8, 2+6=8, total 16. Ratio 5:3:2:6. Doesn't fit our 3:1.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16 parts, ratio 6:2:6:2. Simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which fits our 3:1 but scaled up.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16 parts. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Simplifies to 3:9:1:3, which isn't a clean 3:1.\n\nOption D: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1, which is different from our 3:1.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match my conclusion. Option A scales my 3:1 ratio to 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16, and the phenotypes correspond to the counts. But looking at option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. So Checkered Brown is 6, Plain Brown is 2, Checkered Red is 6, Plain Red is 2. That totals 16, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. So it matches.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I had 12 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Brown, 2 Checkered Red, 2 Plain Red, that's 20, which is incorrect because the total should be 16. So scaling factor is 16 divided by 16, giving 12:2:2:2, which is 3:1:3:1. Thus, option A: Checkered Red 6, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Red 6, Plain Brown 2. That's 6+2+6+2=16, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 3:1:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option A is labeled as \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Yes, that fits.\n\nWait, but hold on. The F2 phenotypic ratio was 75% Checkered Brown and 25% Plain Checkered. So the actual count should reflect that. If we assume the F2 population is 16 individuals, then 75% would be 12 Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Checkered would be 4. But none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, if the F2 population is larger, say 16, then option A is correct. If the F2 population is 16, option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the F2",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",

Since there are two genes, each contributing to the phenotype, the total phenotypic ratios would involve 3^2 = 9 possible phenotypes if both genes were segregating independently, but given the problem statement, it seems each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.

So the correct Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n        ---+---+---\n          | B | b\n        ---+---+---\n        C | CB | cB\n        ---+---+---\n        c | cB | cc\n```\n\nBut since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 would include all combinations of the alleles. So the correct Punnett square is:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n        ---+---+---\n          | B | b\n        ---+---+---\n        C | CB | cB\n        ---+---+---\n        c | cB | cc\n```\n\nEach cell represents a possible genotype. Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - CB: C_, so red\n  - cB: c_, so plain\n  - cb: c_, so plain\n- For the color (B):\n  - CB: B_, so brown\n  - cB: b_, so checkered\n  - cc: bb, so checkered\n\nBut wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So a bird is red if it has at least one red allele, brown if at least one brown, and checkered if it has at least one checkered (but wait, in this case, the checkered allele is represented by 'b' for the B gene). Wait, perhaps I should clarify:\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for the pigment (C), it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, for the color (B): if at least one dominant allele, brown; else, checkered. However, the problem states that checkered is determined by the recessive allele for pigment (c), and brown by dominant (B). So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Therefore, a bird could be:\n\n- Red: has at least one dominant pigment allele (C)\n- Brown: has at least one dominant color allele (B)\n- Checkered: has at least one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one recessive color allele (b)\n\nBut wait, perhaps the checking is done per gene. So for pigment (C):\n\n- C_: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B_: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nTherefore, a bird is:\n\n- Red if it has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and at least one dominant color allele (B).\n- Brown if it has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) but no dominant color allele (i.e., B is recessive, so Bb or bb).\n- Checkered if it has no dominant pigment allele (c) but has at least one dominant color allele (B).\n- Plain if it has no dominant pigment allele (c) and no dominant color allele (b).\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation. Looking back at the Punnett square, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CB: C_, B_ \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n3. cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n4. cc: c_, b_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to analyze each genotype:\n\nFrom the Punnett square cells:\n\n- CB: C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 Red-Brown\n- cB: c_ (plain) and B_ (brown) \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cB: same as above \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cc: c_ (plain) and b_ (checkered) \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 2 out of 4 are Red-Brown\n- 2 out of 4 are Checkered-Brown\n- 0 out of 4 are Plain-Checkered\n- 0 out of 4 are Plain-Red\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options suggest more than one phenotype. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the Punnett square.\n\nWait, each F2 cell corresponds to a possible genotype, but some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype due to co-dominance or dominance. For example, CB and cB could lead to the same phenotype if they are heterozygous. But in reality, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of whether the other is present. So CB would be C_ and B_, leading to Red-Brown. Similarly, cB would be c_ and B_, also leading to Checkered-Brown. So in the Punnett square, each cell represents a unique genotype, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. \n\nLooking back, the correct F2 genotypes would have:\n\n- 1/4 chance of CB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- 1/4 chance of cB \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- 1/4 chance of cb \u2192 plain-Checkered\n- 1/4 chance of cc \u2192 Plain-Red\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/4\n- Checkered-Brown: 1/4\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain-Red: 1/4\n\nBut none of the answer choices seem to reflect this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nL. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\n\nHmm, none of these match my calculation. Maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. It mentions \"phenotypes\" without specifying each possible phenotype. It lists the options as various numbers for each phenotype. Perhaps instead of focusing on specific combinations, the question wants the overall ratio of checkered vs plain versus red vs brown. Let me calculate the total number of each phenotype across all F2 individuals.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown (from cB)\n2. Plain-Checkered (from cc)\n3. Plain-Red (from cc, but that's a typo; actually, it's plain-red, i.e., cc B_ \u2192 plain-red)\n4. Red-Brown (from CB)\n\nWait, no\u2014in the F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/4\n- Checkered-Brown: 1/4\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain-Red: 1/4\n\nBut looking at the options, J says 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That adds up to 12 birds, which matches the 4x4=16 grid. But according to our analysis, each phenotype should occur equally: 4 each. So why do the options vary?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Red-Brown: Number of CB cases: 1/4 \u2192 4 birds.\n2. Checkered-Brown: cB cases: 1/4 \u2192 4 birds.\n3. Plain-Checkered: cc cases: 1/4 \u2192 4 birds.\n4. Plain-Red: plain-red would be from cc bb, but in F2, it's actually cc B_ \u2192 plain-red. So how many? From the Punnett square, the cc cases (which are 4) correspond to:\n\n- cc B_ \u2192 plain-red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014cc B_ is plain-red, while cc bb is plain brown. So:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 4\n- Plain-Checkered: 4 (cc bb)\n- Plain-Red: 4 (cc B_)\n- Red-Brown: 4 (CB bb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I confused something earlier. In the F2, the genotype cc bb would produce only plain brown, while cc B_ would produce plain-red. So:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 4 (cB cases)\n- Plain-Checkered: 4 (cc bb)\n- Plain-Red: 4 (cc B_)\n- Red-Brown: 4 (CB bb)\n\nThat makes sense now. So each phenotype occurs 4 times, totaling 16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options match this exact ratio. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nOption J: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 12, but F2 is 16 birds. Doesn't add up.\n\nOption K: 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16. This matches what I've calculated. So Option K is 4:4:4:4.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided say 4:4:4:4. Let me double-check the options.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Option G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 sum 16, but the ratios don't align with our calculations.\n\n- Option H: 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 sum 16, but again, ratios don't match.\n\n- Option I: 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 sum 16.\n\n- Option J: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 sum 12.\n\n- Option L: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 sum 16.\n\nNone of these options seem to match 4:4:4:4. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy rather than the genetic ratios. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant color, it's red-brown; otherwise, it's plain. But in this case, the dominant colors are already considered, so the phenotype would be determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant color.\n\nGiven that, let's recalculate the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: cB (has c, which is recessive for pigment, so checkered; has B, which is dominant for color, so brown)\n- Plain-Checkered: cc (no pigment) and c (recessive color?), wait, no\u2014the color is determined by B and b. So if B is dominant, then any bird with at least one B allele has brown color, regardless of color allele. Hmm, perhaps I got that reversed.\n\nWait, the color determination is based on B and b. If a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; if it has at least one b, it's checkered. Pigment is determined by C and c. If a bird has at least one C allele, it's red; otherwise, plain.\n\nSo, for a bird to be red-brown, it must have at least one C (red) and at least one B (brown). To be checkered-brown, it must have at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown). Plain-red requires at least one c and no B. Plain-brown requires no C and at least one B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-Brown: C_B_\n2. Checkered-Brown: c_B_\n3. Plain-Red: _cb\n4. Plain-Brown: __B_\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype depends on these conditions. Let's count the number of each phenotype.\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CB: C_, B_ \u2192 Red-Brown (4 birds)\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown (4 birds)\n- cb: C_, b_ \u2192 Red-Checkered (4 birds)\n- cc: c_, c_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered (4 birds)\n- Wait, no\u2014cc would be c_, c_, which has no C (so plain) and no B (so checkered). Wait, no\u2014if cc is crossed with Bb, but in F2, cc would have no C, so it would be plain-color regardless of B. But in this case, the F2 is from F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), so the F2 would include all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a table:\n\nPhenotype | Count\n---|---\nRed-Brown | ?\nCheckered-Brown | ?\nPlain-Red | ?\nPlain-Brown | ?\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Red-Brown: Must have at least one C (red) and at least one B (brown). So, in the Punnett square, this would be the cells where the C allele is present and the B allele is present. Looking at the Punnett square, which cells meet both criteria? From the earlier breakdown, the only cells that have both C and B are CB and cB. Wait, no\u2014CB has C and B, so that's Red-Brown. Similarly, cB has c and B, so that's Checkered-Brown. Wait, but in the F2, the cells would represent the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each cell to its phenotype:\n\n- CB: C_, B_ \u2192 Red-Brown\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cb: C_, b_ \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: c_, c_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n\nWait, but cc would produce c_ in both alleles, making it Plain-Color regardless of B. So:\n\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cB: same as above \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cb: c_, b_ \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: c_, c_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, from the Punnett square:\n\n- CB: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- cB: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- Red-Brown: 4\n- Checkered-Brown: 4\n- Red-Checkered: 4\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nWhich sums to 16 birds, matching the F2",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, the probability is 3/4 for one phenotype and 1/4 for another. However, since the genes are linked, the actual phenotypic ratios might differ, but the problem doesn't specify linkage, so we'll assume independence. Thus, the combined phenotypic ratios would be 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for red-brown, 9/16 for red-checkered, etc. Wait, no\u2014the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits. Since there are two genes, each contributing to the phenotype, the total phenotypic ratios would involve 3^2 = 9 possible phenotypes if both genes were segregating independently, but given the problem statement, it seems each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are considered for each trait separately and then combined. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation having different ratios based on dominance. Given the complexity, maybe the best approach is to calculate the expected phenotypic ratios for each gene and then combine them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the specific options provided and see which one fits. The options are A through H, each giving a specific phenotypic ratio. To determine which option is correct, let's consider the F2 generation. The F1 from the cross of CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have a certain distribution of phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - C_: red\n  - cc: plain\n\n- For the color (B):\n  - B_: brown\n  - bb: checkered\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Alternatively, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype. However, the way the options are presented suggests that each bird's phenotype is determined by either being red, brown, checkered, or plain, depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation, where each parent is CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n           | CB    | cb\n       -----------------\n        CB      | CcBb | CcBb\n        cb      | CcBb | CcBb\n        cB      | CcBb | CcBb\n        cb      | CcBb | CcBb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the correct Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n        ---+---+---\n          | B | b\n        ---+---+---\n        C | CB | cB\n        ---+---+---\n        c | cB | cc\n```\n\nBut since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 would include all combinations of the alleles. So the correct Punnett square is:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n        ---+---+---\n          | B | b\n        ---+---+---\n        C | CB | cB\n        ---+---+---\n        c | cB | cc\n```\n\nEach cell represents a possible genotype. Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - CB: C_, so red\n  - cB: c_, so plain\n  - cb: c_, so plain\n- For the color (B):\n  - CB: B_, so brown\n  - cB: b_, so checkered\n  - cc: bb, so checkered\n\nBut wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So a bird is red if it has at least one red allele, brown if at least one brown, and checkered if it has at least one checkered (but wait, in this case, the checkered allele is represented by 'b' for the B gene). Wait, perhaps I should clarify:\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for the pigment (C), it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, for the color (B): if at least one dominant allele, brown; else, checkered. However, the problem states that checkered is determined by the recessive allele for pigment (c), and brown by dominant (B). So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Therefore, a bird could be:\n\n- Red: has at least one dominant pigment allele (C)\n- Brown: has at least one dominant color allele (B)\n- Checkered: has at least one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one recessive color allele (b)\n\nBut wait, perhaps the checking is done per gene. So for pigment (C):\n\n- C_: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B_: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nTherefore, a bird is:\n\n- Red if it has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and at least one dominant color allele (B).\n- Brown if it has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) but no dominant color allele (i.e., B is recessive, so Bb or bb).\n- Checkered if it has no dominant pigment allele (c) but has at least one dominant color allele (B).\n- Plain if it has no dominant pigment allele (c) and no dominant color allele (b).\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation. Looking back at the Punnett square, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CB: C_, B_ \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n3. cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n4. cc: c_, b_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to analyze each genotype:\n\nFrom the Punnett square cells:\n\n- CB: C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 Red-Brown\n- cB: c_ (plain) and B_ (brown) \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cB: same as above \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cc: c_ (plain) and b_ (checkered) \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 2 out of 4 are Red-Brown\n- 2 out of 4 are Checkered-Brown\n- 0 out of 4 are Plain-Checkered\n- 0 out of 4 are Plain-Red\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options suggest more than one phenotype. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the Punnett square.\n\nWait, each F2 cell corresponds to a possible genotype, but some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype due to co-dominance or dominance. For example, CB and cB could lead to the same phenotype if they are heterozygous. But in reality, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of whether the other is present. So CB would be C_ and B_, leading to Red-Brown. Similarly, cB would be c_ and B_, also leading to Checkered-Brown. So in the Punnett square, each cell represents a unique genotype, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. \n\nLooking back, the correct F2 genotypes would have:\n\n- 1/4 chance of CB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- 1/4 chance of cB \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- 1/4 chance of cb \u2192 plain-Checkered\n- 1/4 chance of cc \u2192 Plain-Red\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/4\n- Checkered-Brown: 1/4\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain-Red: 1/4\n\nBut none of the answer choices seem to reflect this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nL. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\n\nHmm, none of these match my calculation. Maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. It mentions \"phenotypes\" without specifying each possible phenotype. It lists the options as various numbers for each phenotype. Perhaps instead of focusing on specific combinations, the question wants the overall ratio of checkered vs plain versus red vs brown. Let me calculate the total number of each phenotype across all F2 individuals.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered-Brown (from cB)\n2. Plain-Checkered (from cc)\n3. Plain-Red (from cc, but that's a typo; actually, it's plain-red, i.e., cc B_ \u2192 plain-red)\n4. Red-Brown (from CB)\n\nWait, no\u2014in the F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/4\n- Checkered-Brown: 1/4\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain-Red: 1/4\n\nBut looking at the options, J says 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That adds up to 12 birds, which matches the 4x4=16 grid. But according to our analysis, each phenotype should occur equally: 4 each. So why do the options vary?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Red-Brown: Number of CB cases: 1/4 \u2192 4 birds.\n2. Checkered-Brown: cB cases: 1/4 \u2192 4 birds.\n3. Plain-Checkered: cc cases: 1/4 \u2192 4 birds.\n4. Plain-Red: plain-red would be from cc bb, but in F2, it's actually cc B_ \u2192 plain-red. So how many? From the Punnett square, the cc cases (which are 4) correspond to:\n\n- cc B_ \u2192 plain-red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014cc B_ is plain-red, while cc bb is plain brown. So:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 4\n- Plain-Checkered: 4 (cc bb)\n- Plain-Red: 4 (cc B_)\n- Red-Brown: 4 (CB bb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I confused something earlier. In the F2, the genotype cc bb would produce only plain brown, while cc B_ would produce plain-red. So:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: 4 (cB cases)\n- Plain-Checkered: 4 (cc bb)\n- Plain-Red: 4 (cc B_)\n- Red-Brown: 4 (CB bb)\n\nThat makes sense now. So each phenotype occurs 4 times, totaling 16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options match this exact ratio. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nOption J: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 12, but F2 is 16 birds. Doesn't add up.\n\nOption K: 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16. This matches what I've calculated. So Option K is 4:4:4:4.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided say 4:4:4:4. Let me double-check the options.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Option G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 sum 16, but the ratios don't align with our calculations.\n\n- Option H: 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 sum 16, but again, ratios don't match.\n\n- Option I: 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 sum 16.\n\n- Option J: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 sum 12.\n\n- Option L: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 sum 16.\n\nNone of these options seem to match 4:4:4:4. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy rather than the genetic ratios. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant color, it's red-brown; otherwise, it's plain. But in this case, the dominant colors are already considered, so the phenotype would be determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant color.\n\nGiven that, let's recalculate the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered-Brown: cB (has c, which is recessive for pigment, so checkered; has B, which is dominant for color, so brown)\n- Plain-Checkered: cc (no pigment) and c (recessive color?), wait, no\u2014the color is determined by B and b. So if B is dominant, then any bird with at least one B allele has brown color, regardless of color allele. Hmm, perhaps I got that reversed.\n\nWait, the color determination is based on B and b. If a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; if it has at least one b, it's checkered. Pigment is determined by C and c. If a bird has at least one C allele, it's red; otherwise, plain.\n\nSo, for a bird to be red-brown, it must have at least one C (red) and at least one B (brown). To be checkered-brown, it must have at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown). Plain-red requires at least one c and no B. Plain-brown requires no C and at least one B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-Brown: C_B_\n2. Checkered-Brown: c_B_\n3. Plain-Red: _cb\n4. Plain-Brown: __B_\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype depends on these conditions. Let's count the number of each phenotype.\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CB: C_, B_ \u2192 Red-Brown (4 birds)\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown (4 birds)\n- cb: C_, b_ \u2192 Red-Checkered (4 birds)\n- cc: c_, c_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered (4 birds)\n- Wait, no\u2014cc would be c_, c_, which has no C (so plain) and no B (so checkered). Wait, no\u2014if cc is crossed with Bb, but in F2, cc would have no C, so it would be plain-color regardless of B. But in this case, the F2 is from F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), so the F2 would include all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a table:\n\nPhenotype | Count\n---|---\nRed-Brown | ?\nCheckered-Brown | ?\nPlain-Red | ?\nPlain-Brown | ?\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Red-Brown: Must have at least one C (red) and at least one B (brown). So, in the Punnett square, this would be the cells where the C allele is present and the B allele is present. Looking at the Punnett square, which cells meet both criteria? From the earlier breakdown, the only cells that have both C and B are CB and cB. Wait, no\u2014CB has C and B, so that's Red-Brown. Similarly, cB has c and B, so that's Checkered-Brown. Wait, but in the F2, the cells would represent the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each cell to its phenotype:\n\n- CB: C_, B_ \u2192 Red-Brown\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cb: C_, b_ \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: c_, c_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n\nWait, but cc would produce c_ in both alleles, making it Plain-Color regardless of B. So:\n\n- cB: c_, B_ \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cB: same as above \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cb: c_, b_ \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: c_, c_ \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSo, from the Punnett square:\n\n- CB: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- cB: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- Red-Brown: 4\n- Checkered-Brown: 4\n- Red-Checkered: 4\n- Plain-Checkered: 4\n\nWhich sums to 16 birds, matching the F2",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "chunk_resampled": "So each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but when combined, the overall phenotype depends on the dominance.",
    "rollout": " So each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but when combined, the overall phenotype depends on the dominance.\n\nWait, actually, for each gene, there are two possible phenotypes: dominant or recessive. So for the C locus, 3/4 chance of having pigment (red) and 1/4 plain. For the B locus, 3/4 chance of brown (dominant) and 1/4 checkered. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16 for red brown, (3/4 * 1/4)=3/16 for red checkered, (1/4 * 3/4)=3/16 for plain brown, and (1/4 * 1/4)=1/16 for plain checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But the options given don't include 9:3:3:1 directly. Instead, looking at the answer choices:\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That also doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the problem, or maybe I misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are different. Let me double-check the problem statement. It says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo Gene C determines pigment: dominant (red), recessive (plain). Gene B determines color: dominant (brown), recessive (checkered). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb (since both genes are recessive)\n- Plain: cc BB (only B is recessive)\n- Brown: CC bb (only C is dominant)\n- Red: CC BB (both C and B dominant)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the four phenotypes are: checkered, plain, brown, red. Now, if the F2 generation is being considered, what are the ratios?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure (one homozygous dominant for each trait), the F2 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, as each gene acts independently. However, none of the answer options exactly reflect this except for option G, which seems to suggest a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different scenario where the parents are not both homozygous.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So both parents are homozygous: one is CC BB (checkered red), and the other is cc bb (plain brown).\n\nTherefore, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question isn't about the F2 generation but the entire cross including F1 and F2. But the question specifically asks for the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the F1 phenotypic ratio before selfing, but the question mentions F2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to create a Punnett square for the F1 and then determine the F2 phenotypic ratio along with the genotypes and genotypic and phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, the user included the F1 gametes: (CB) (cb). So F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes either CB or cb. Then, when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering the actual phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n- CC \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 red (since C is dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor B locus:\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes combine as:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\nRed brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\nRed checkered: CC bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\nPlain brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\nPlain checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+2+1=8, but the sum is 8. However, according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the numbers should add up to 16. This suggests that my initial analysis might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, not both. But that wouldn't make sense because both genes are acting independently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2, but the user specified F2.\n\nWait, going back to the question: It asks for the F2 generation. If the F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the answer options provided do not include 9:3:3:1 directly. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2013 doesn't fit.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2013 doesn't fit.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2013 doesn't fit.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2013 which sums to 16.\n\nHmm, option D is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to 1 plain checkered, 3 plain brown, 9 red checkered, 3 red brown. But according to our analysis, the counts should be 8 red (including red brown and red checkered), 4 brown, 4 checkered, and 0 plain. Wait, that's a different count.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n2. Plain: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\n3. Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\n4. Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 instances\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because when you look at the actual phenotypes:\n\nEach individual will express a specific phenotype based on both genes. Let me list them:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Red brown: 3 individuals\n- Red checkered: 2 individuals\n- Plain brown: 2 individuals\n- Plain checkered: 1 individual\n\nTotal: 3+2+2+1=8. But according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the total should be 16, implying that each category should have a multiple of 4 (since 4\u00d74=16). However, in reality, some categories may have fewer individuals due to genetic constraints, such as incomplete dominance or other factors, but in this case, it's a dihybrid cross without dominance, so it should follow 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 3 red, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered, totaling 8. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F2 generation, but the calculations lead to a ratio of 3:2:2:1, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the question is not about F2, but the entire cross including F1 and F2. However, the question specifies the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but that's not stated in the problem. The problem clearly states that the parents are homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb).\n\nGiven that, the F2 should follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the answer options, none directly match this. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which seems too high. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which matches the 1:3:9:3 ratio, corresponding to the number of ways to get each phenotype. \n\nWait, but according to our analysis, the counts are 3 red brown, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered, totaling 8. But 1:3:9:3 sums to 16, which would require each phenotype to appear 4 times. However, in reality, the phenotypes can't all appear equally unless certain conditions apply, like dominant over recessive in both genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and refers to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that's the case, the F1 phenotypic ratio would be 3 red, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered, adding up to 8. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the options, option H is 5,3,2,6, which could correspond to the number of each phenotype multiplied by 4. For example, 5\u00d74=20, which is more than 16, so unlikely. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, still less than 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation, not F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would be in the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't align with that.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem considers only the dominant alleles for each gene and ignores the recessive ones, leading to a simplified ratio. For example, considering only whether a bird is red or plain (C) and brown or checkered (B), ignoring the other alleles. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 when combined. However, none of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the F1 generation after selfing, but the user mentioned F2. This is getting confusing. Let me try to go through the options again.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 which is 1 plain checkered, 3 plain brown, 9 red checkered, 3 red brown. This fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio if each phenotype is represented 4 times. Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 already accounts for the ratios, so each phenotype would have 4x its frequency. Wait, but 9:3:3:1 represents the actual counts, not scaled by 4. So in terms of relative frequencies, it's 9 parts red brown, 3 red checkered, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. So the total parts are 16. Therefore, the proportion of each phenotype is 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nBut the answer options are presented as absolute numbers, not fractions. So perhaps the question is expecting the number of each phenotype in a certain population size. But without knowing the total number, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, not both. For example, checking if C is present (red) or not (plain), and similarly for B. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- C present (red):\n   - B present (brown): red brown (3 cases)\n   - B absent (checkered): red checkered (1 case)\n- C absent (plain):\n   - B present (brown): plain brown (3 cases)\n   - B absent (checkered): plain checkered (1 case)\n\nThis would give a ratio of 3:1:1:1, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing only on the dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (red to checkered) and 3:1 (brown to plain). Combining these, the overall ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4) : (3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)*(3/4) : (1/4)*(1/4) \u2192 9:3:3:1, same as before.\n\nGiven that, none of the answer options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option G is 12,2,2,0, which is 12:2:2:0, but that sums to 16. Wait, 12+2+2+0=16. So 12 red checkered, 2 red brown, 2 plain brown, 0 plain checkered. But according to the 9:3:3:1, the counts should be proportional to 9:3:3:1. So 12 would be 9*1.333..., which doesn't make sense because the ratio must remain consistent across generations. Therefore, option G cannot be correct.\n\nOption H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16. Again, 5:3:2:6 is not matching the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. This fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio when each part is multiplied by 1/16. So 9*(1/16) \u22480.5625, but 1 is 1/16, 3 is 3/16, 9 is 9/16, 3 is 3/16. So the proportions are approximately 1:3:9:3, which is similar to option D.\n\nHowever, the exact counts would depend on the number of offspring produced. Assuming a large enough sample, the ratios should hold true. Therefore, option D seems to represent the 9:3:3:1 ratio when each phenotype is multiplied by 1/16.\n\nBut wait, according to our earlier breakdown, the counts were 3 red brown, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. Summing to 8, which is half of 16. So if the population is 16, the actual counts would be:\n\n- Red brown: 3\n- Red checkered: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nWhich totals 8. Therefore, if the population is 16, the distribution would be 12 red checkered (but that's not fitting the 9:3:3:1), so perhaps the answer expects the raw counts regardless of the population size, making option D the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but when combined, the overall phenotype depends on the dominance.\n\nWait, actually, for each gene, there are two possible phenotypes: dominant or recessive. So for the C locus, 3/4 chance of having pigment (red) and 1/4 plain. For the B locus, 3/4 chance of brown (dominant) and 1/4 checkered. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16 for red brown, (3/4 * 1/4)=3/16 for red checkered, (1/4 * 3/4)=3/16 for plain brown, and (1/4 * 1/4)=1/16 for plain checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But the options given don't include 9:3:3:1 directly. Instead, looking at the answer choices:\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That also doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the problem, or maybe I misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are different. Let me double-check the problem statement. It says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo Gene C determines pigment: dominant (red), recessive (plain). Gene B determines color: dominant (brown), recessive (checkered). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb (since both genes are recessive)\n- Plain: cc BB (only B is recessive)\n- Brown: CC bb (only C is dominant)\n- Red: CC BB (both C and B dominant)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the four phenotypes are: checkered, plain, brown, red. Now, if the F2 generation is being considered, what are the ratios?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure (one homozygous dominant for each trait), the F2 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, as each gene acts independently. However, none of the answer options exactly reflect this except for option G, which seems to suggest a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different scenario where the parents are not both homozygous.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So both parents are homozygous: one is CC BB (checkered red), and the other is cc bb (plain brown).\n\nTherefore, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question isn't about the F2 generation but the entire cross including F1 and F2. But the question specifically asks for the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the F1 phenotypic ratio before selfing, but the question mentions F2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to create a Punnett square for the F1 and then determine the F2 phenotypic ratio along with the genotypes and genotypic and phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, the user included the F1 gametes: (CB) (cb). So F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes either CB or cb. Then, when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering the actual phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n- CC \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 red (since C is dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor B locus:\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes combine as:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\nRed brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\nRed checkered: CC bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\nPlain brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\nPlain checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+2+1=8, but the sum is 8. However, according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the numbers should add up to 16. This suggests that my initial analysis might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, not both. But that wouldn't make sense because both genes are acting independently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2, but the user specified F2.\n\nWait, going back to the question: It asks for the F2 generation. If the F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the answer options provided do not include 9:3:3:1 directly. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2013 doesn't fit.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2013 doesn't fit.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2013 doesn't fit.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2013 which sums to 16.\n\nHmm, option D is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to 1 plain checkered, 3 plain brown, 9 red checkered, 3 red brown. But according to our analysis, the counts should be 8 red (including red brown and red checkered), 4 brown, 4 checkered, and 0 plain. Wait, that's a different count.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n2. Plain: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\n3. Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\n4. Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 instances\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because when you look at the actual phenotypes:\n\nEach individual will express a specific phenotype based on both genes. Let me list them:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Red brown: 3 individuals\n- Red checkered: 2 individuals\n- Plain brown: 2 individuals\n- Plain checkered: 1 individual\n\nTotal: 3+2+2+1=8. But according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the total should be 16, implying that each category should have a multiple of 4 (since 4\u00d74=16). However, in reality, some categories may have fewer individuals due to genetic constraints, such as incomplete dominance or other factors, but in this case, it's a dihybrid cross without dominance, so it should follow 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 3 red, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered, totaling 8. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F2 generation, but the calculations lead to a ratio of 3:2:2:1, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the question is not about F2, but the entire cross including F1 and F2. However, the question specifies the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but that's not stated in the problem. The problem clearly states that the parents are homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb).\n\nGiven that, the F2 should follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the answer options, none directly match this. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which seems too high. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which matches the 1:3:9:3 ratio, corresponding to the number of ways to get each phenotype. \n\nWait, but according to our analysis, the counts are 3 red brown, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered, totaling 8. But 1:3:9:3 sums to 16, which would require each phenotype to appear 4 times. However, in reality, the phenotypes can't all appear equally unless certain conditions apply, like dominant over recessive in both genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and refers to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that's the case, the F1 phenotypic ratio would be 3 red, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered, adding up to 8. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the options, option H is 5,3,2,6, which could correspond to the number of each phenotype multiplied by 4. For example, 5\u00d74=20, which is more than 16, so unlikely. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, still less than 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation, not F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would be in the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't align with that.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem considers only the dominant alleles for each gene and ignores the recessive ones, leading to a simplified ratio. For example, considering only whether a bird is red or plain (C) and brown or checkered (B), ignoring the other alleles. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 when combined. However, none of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the F1 generation after selfing, but the user mentioned F2. This is getting confusing. Let me try to go through the options again.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 which is 1 plain checkered, 3 plain brown, 9 red checkered, 3 red brown. This fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio if each phenotype is represented 4 times. Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 already accounts for the ratios, so each phenotype would have 4x its frequency. Wait, but 9:3:3:1 represents the actual counts, not scaled by 4. So in terms of relative frequencies, it's 9 parts red brown, 3 red checkered, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. So the total parts are 16. Therefore, the proportion of each phenotype is 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nBut the answer options are presented as absolute numbers, not fractions. So perhaps the question is expecting the number of each phenotype in a certain population size. But without knowing the total number, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, not both. For example, checking if C is present (red) or not (plain), and similarly for B. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- C present (red):\n   - B present (brown): red brown (3 cases)\n   - B absent (checkered): red checkered (1 case)\n- C absent (plain):\n   - B present (brown): plain brown (3 cases)\n   - B absent (checkered): plain checkered (1 case)\n\nThis would give a ratio of 3:1:1:1, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing only on the dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (red to checkered) and 3:1 (brown to plain). Combining these, the overall ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4) : (3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)*(3/4) : (1/4)*(1/4) \u2192 9:3:3:1, same as before.\n\nGiven that, none of the answer options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option G is 12,2,2,0, which is 12:2:2:0, but that sums to 16. Wait, 12+2+2+0=16. So 12 red checkered, 2 red brown, 2 plain brown, 0 plain checkered. But according to the 9:3:3:1, the counts should be proportional to 9:3:3:1. So 12 would be 9*1.333..., which doesn't make sense because the ratio must remain consistent across generations. Therefore, option G cannot be correct.\n\nOption H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16. Again, 5:3:2:6 is not matching the 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. This fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio when each part is multiplied by 1/16. So 9*(1/16) \u22480.5625, but 1 is 1/16, 3 is 3/16, 9 is 9/16, 3 is 3/16. So the proportions are approximately 1:3:9:3, which is similar to option D.\n\nHowever, the exact counts would depend on the number of offspring produced. Assuming a large enough sample, the ratios should hold true. Therefore, option D seems to represent the 9:3:3:1 ratio when each phenotype is multiplied by 1/16.\n\nBut wait, according to our earlier breakdown, the counts were 3 red brown, 2 red checkered, 2 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. Summing to 8, which is half of 16. So if the population is 16, the actual counts would be:\n\n- Red brown: 3\n- Red checkered: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nWhich totals 8. Therefore, if the population is 16, the distribution would be 12 red checkered (but that's not fitting the 9:3:3:1), so perhaps the answer expects the raw counts regardless of the population size, making option D the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",
