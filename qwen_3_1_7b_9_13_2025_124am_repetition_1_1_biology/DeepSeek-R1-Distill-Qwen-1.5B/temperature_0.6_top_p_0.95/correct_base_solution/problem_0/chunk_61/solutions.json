    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo there are four phenotypic categories. Now, the F2 population will have these four categories. To find the exact ratio, I'll calculate how many birds fall into each category.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Absence (c): 1/4 (only cc)\n\nFor the body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment present, body absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n3.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the assumptions.\n\nWait, another approach: If both parents are homozygous for each trait, then the F1 will be heterozygous for both traits, and F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, the actual ratio depends on whether the traits are linked or not. In this case, the genes are likely assorting independently, so the F2 would indeed have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, our previous analysis gave us 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider dominance differently, such as where some phenotypes are the same. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio includes checking for dominance in both traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 phenotypic ratio before moving to F2, but according to the question, it's asking about F2.\n\nWait, the question states: \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps I was correct earlier, but the options don't have 9,3,3,1.

So perhaps the F2 includes all four phenotypes, but the user might have omitted some.\n\nBut according to the question, the options are:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2. To calculate this, I'll use the fact that each gene follows a 3:1 ratio in F2 generation (assuming Mendelian inheritance without any incomplete dominance or other factors).\n\nFor the C locus: the F2 will have 3/4 chance of being C (red) and 1/4 chance of being c (plain).\nFor the B locus: similarly, 3/4 chance of B (brown) and 1/4 chance of b (checkered).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations will have probabilities of:\n\n- (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for Checkered red\n- (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 for Checkered brown\n- (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 for Plain red\n- (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 for Plain brown\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers assuming a large number of birds, say 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't fit. Option A has 6 each, but our calculation shows 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options perfectly match this, but looking at the options, option G seems closest but isn't matching. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Wait, no\u2014it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the user included F2 in the options. But according to my calculations, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown. But none of the options match this exactly. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, whereas our calculation sums to 16 as well (9+3+3+1=16). But the actual counts are different. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the F1 instead of F2. In that case, the F1 would have a phenotypic ratio of 6:2 (checkered red to checkered brown) and 6:2 (plain red to plain brown). But that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean none of the options match exactly, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which is double what I calculated. Maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The question mentions the F2 generation, but the options include various ratios. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead. If so, then the F1 phenotypic ratio is 6:2 (checkered red to checkered brown) and 6:2 (plain red to plain brown). But none of the options match that either. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each gene, hence 9:3:3:1 overall. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's improbable. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again: The question is about the F2 generation, but the options suggest that the F1 is considered. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1, but mistakenly included F2 in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the options don't reflect that. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 overall. Since none of the options match exactly, but perhaps option G is the closest, but it's 12:2:2:0, which suggests a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but scaled up differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to ignore the dominance and count all possible phenotypes, resulting in 16 birds with 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown, leading to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match this exactly, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which is double, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the user provides options, I must choose the best one. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Wait, let's recalculate:\n\nFor F2, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red (cB): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Checkered brown (cb): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain red (CC): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown (cc): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the 16 birds. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the counts are different. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the closest is option G, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1, which would have a phenotypic ratio of 6:2 for each gene, totaling 16 birds. Again, none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the F1 phenotypic ratio as 6:2, but presented it as F2. Since the options don't provide F1, I think the intended answer is option G, even though it doesn't perfectly align. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, but I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. However, the way the question presents it, the possible phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So four possible phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nWait, let's clarify: For the C locus, the presence of C results in red, otherwise plain. For B locus, presence of B results in brown, otherwise checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cB (since c is recessive for C, and B is dominant for B)\n2. Checkered brown: cb (c recessive for C, b recessive for B)\n3. Plain red: CC (C dominant, B recessive)\n4. Plain brown: Cc (C dominant, B dominant)\n\nSo the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotypic combinations for each gene. Now, to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, we need to consider how many birds fall into each category.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: Checkered checkered (but wait, the options don't include this, so maybe it's not part of the F2?)\nWait, no\u2014the options given don't seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options provided, none directly mention \"Checkered checkered.\" Instead, the options are about checkered vs plain red and checkered vs plain brown. So perhaps the F2 includes all four phenotypes, but the user might have omitted some.\n\nBut according to the question, the options are:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2.

Pigment Plain and Checkered (c_bb): Plain, checkered.\n\nSo there are four phenotypes, each corresponding to a specific combination of the two genes' dominant or recessive states. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To calculate this, we need to determine how many birds have each phenotype. Since the parents are both heterozygotes (CcBb), the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently, and combined, it's a 9:3:3:1 for the two genes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_): Both dominant, so red and brown.\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_bb): Pigment red, checkered.\n3. Pigment Plain and Brown (c_B_): Plain, brown.\n4. Pigment Plain and Checkered (c_bb): Plain, checkered.\n\nSo there are four phenotypes, each corresponding to a specific combination of the two genes' dominant or recessive states. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To calculate this, we need to determine how many birds have each phenotype. Since the parents are both heterozygotes (CcBb), the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently, and combined, it's a 9:3:3:1 for the two genes. But let's break it down.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence (C): 3/4\n- Absence (c): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. Let's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_bb):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. Pigment Plain and Brown (c_B_):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. Pigment Plain and Checkered (c_bb):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, converting these fractions into a ratio by finding common denominators:\n\nTotal ratio = 9:3:3:1\n\nBut wait, the question provides options where the sum isn't normalized. Alternatively, sometimes phenotypic ratios are expressed as whole numbers without dividing by the denominator. Looking back at the options given:\n\nOptions A through H list different ratios, including totals like 6+2=8, etc. So perhaps the answer expects the ratio without normalization, adding up the counts.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: the question says \"phenotypic ratio,\" which typically refers to the proportion of each phenotype relative to each other. If we consider the actual counts, then the 9:3:3:1 ratio applies. However, some options might represent the sum of certain phenotypes over others.\n\nLooking at option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 summing to 16. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0 \u2192 also not matching. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype to the total number of birds. In that case, the total is 16, so:\n\nRed Brown: 9/16\nRed Checkered: 3/16\nPlain Brown: 3/16\nPlain Checkered: 1/16\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Alternatively, looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, which matches our 9:3:3:1. But wait, checking the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. This corresponds to 1:3:9:3, which is 9:3:3:1 scaled by 1/16. So this seems to fit our calculation. Therefore, option D could be the correct choice, representing the ratio of each phenotype count.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In the F2 generation, each phenotype's frequency is 9:3:3:1, so the actual counts would be 9,3,3,1. But looking at the options, option D lists them as checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That aligns perfectly with our 9:3:3:1 ratio.

However, option D describes the ratio as \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Yes, that's exactly what we got.

For the B locus: presence (brown) vs absence (checkered). The presence of dominant alleles in both loci leads to the most complex phenotype. But let's approach this systematically.\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n\n1. Pigment color (C/B):\n   - If C is present, red\n   - If c is present, plain\n\n2. Body color (B/b):\n   - If B is present, brown\n   - If b is present, checkered\n\nThe phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\na. Red Brown (C B)\nb. Red Checkered (C b)\nc. Plain Brown (c B)\nd. Plain Checkered (c b)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of dominant alleles in each gene. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each combination of alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C (present): 1 (since CC and Cc are all red)\nWait, no\u2014wait, for the pigment color, the bird is either C (dominant, red) or c (recessive, plain). So the probability of having pigment color (C) is 100%, because any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having plain (c) is also 100%.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if the bird has a recessive allele (c), it will be plain, regardless of the other gene. So for pigment color, the bird will always be red if it has even one C allele. Similarly, for the body color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it will be brown.\n- If it has at least one b allele, it will be checkered.\n\nSo the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, which was CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Wait, no\u2014it's actually F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 would come from F1 (CcBb) selfing, producing four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each at 25% frequency.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype a: Red Brown (C B)\n\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype b: Red Checkered (C b)\n\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype c: Plain Brown (c B)\n\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype d: Plain Checkered (c b)\n\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that can't be right because adding up all probabilities (100% + 50% + 50% + 25%) equals 25%, which is less than 100%. That indicates a mistake in my calculation.\n\nAh, I see! Because each gene contributes independently, but the overall probability isn't simply additive like that. Instead, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations of the two genes. Each gene has two possibilities, so there are four possible phenotypes. But the probabilities aren't additive across them because each phenotype is defined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and then categorize them into phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Red Brown)\n5. Cc Bb (Red Checkered)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n7. cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n8. cc Bb (Checkered Checkered)\n9. cc bb (Checkered Brown)\n\nWait, but actually, each gene's possibilities are independent. So for pigment color, the bird can be RR (if RR?), but no\u2014since the bird is diploid, and each gene has two alleles. So for pigment color (C), the bird can be CC (red), Cc (red), or cc (plain). Similarly for B (B or b).\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Both dominant: C and B \u2192 Red Brown\n- C dominant, b \u2192 Red Checkered\n- c dominant, B \u2192 Plain Brown\n- c dominant, b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nSo now, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nSince the F2 generation is derived from F1 (CcBb) selfing, which gave 25% of each of the four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 population consists of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb or cB + CB)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each F2 genotype comes from the combination of two gametes. So the actual counts are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for example, the probability of being CC and BB is 25% * 25% = 6.25%. Similarly, the probability of CC and Bb is 25% * 50% = 12.5%.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. Red Brown (CC BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. Red Checkered (CC Bb): 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n3. Plain Brown (cc BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. Plain Checkered (cc Bb): 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. That suggests another error. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation combines all possible genotypes, and each genotype maps directly to a phenotype without needing to sum probabilities because each is distinct.\n\nWait, no, each genotype is unique, so the phenotypes correspond directly to the genotypes. So the probability for each phenotype is the same as the probability of that genotype. Thus, the four phenotypes have probabilities:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 50%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n\nBecause:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb: 50% (Red Checkered)\n- cc BB: 25% (Plain Brown)\n- cc Bb: 25% (Plain Checkered)\n\nAdding those up: 25% + 50% + 25% + 25% = 125%, which is impossible. This indicates that I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me clarify. Each F2 individual is a combination of two independent alleles from each parent. So, for the C locus:\n\n- Each parent contributes either C or c, and each has a 50% chance of contributing. So the probability of CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, and cc is 25%.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each locus's probabilities. So:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that totals to 100% because each combination is accounted for. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown (CC BB): 6.25%\n- Red Checkered (CC Bb): 12.5%\n- Plain Brown (cc BB): 6.25%\n- Plain Checkered (cc Bb): 12.5%\n\nWait, but that still sums to 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 37.5%, which is less than 100%. Something is wrong here. Maybe I'm missing some combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each F2 individual is a combination of the two genes, and the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Both genes dominant: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- C dominant, b: (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- c dominant, B: (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u219225%\n- c dominant, b: (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u219225%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 25%*4=100%. So each phenotype corresponds to exactly 25% of the F2 population.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% Red Brown, 25% Red Checkered, 25% Plain Brown, 25% Plain Checkered. So none of the options given seem to match this because all phenotypes have the same proportion. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions A through J don't have all four phenotypes equally represented. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 16%, which doesn't fit our 25% each. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, 25% each. Option H has checkered red 5, brown 3, red 2, brown 6. Still unequal. Option F has equal numbers (4 each). Option G has checkered red 12, brown 2, red 2, brown 0. Only 12+2+2+0=16. Option B has checkered red 8, brown 4, red 0, brown 4. Total 16. Option I has similar to B. Option J has checkered red 2, brown 6, red 3, brown 1. Also 12.\n\nWait, according to our analysis, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, so none of the options provide equal representation except option F and G, but F and G don't have equal parts. Option D has 1 + 3 + 9 +3 =16, which is 4 each, but that's not matching 25%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back. Each F2 individual can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability for each phenotype is indeed 25% because each gene contributes independently. So the expected phenotypic ratio should be 25% Red Brown : 25% Red Checkered : 25% Plain Brown : 25% Plain Checkered. But looking at the options:\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's 25% each, totaling 16 birds. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which matches 25% each.\n\nBut wait, the options say \"phenotypic ratio\" and \"genotypic frequencies\". Let me check the exact wording in the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16 birds. So the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That seems different from what I thought before. So perhaps my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. In the F2 generation, the number of birds is 16 (assuming each F2 individual is represented once). The phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 6\n- Plain brown: 2\n\nTotal: 16.\n\nSo the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 ratio 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 ratio 2:1:0:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 ratio 1:3:9:3, which is a geometric progression, suggesting a 27:9:3:1 ratio if scaled up, but it's presented differently.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 ratio 3:9:1:3, which is 3:9:1:3, but that's 16 birds. Summing 3+9+1+3=16. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to figure out how many birds are in each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will consist of 9 possible genotypes, but considering the probabilities, each genotype has a certain frequency.\n\nThe F2 genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. CC BB (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n2. CC Bb (probability 50%): Checkered Checkered\n3. CC bb (probability 25%): Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n5.

Cc bb (probability 25%): Plain Brown\n7. cc BB (probability 25%): Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 generation includes all possible combinations of the two genes, each with their own probabilities. So the actual counts are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- CC Bb: 50% of 16 = 8 birds\n- CC bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Cc BB: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Cc Bb: 50% of 16 = 8 birds\n- Cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- cc BB: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- cc Bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (4 birds)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (8 birds)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (4 birds)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (4 birds)\n5.

So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 4 (from CC BB) + 4 (Cc BB) + 4 (cc BB) + 4 (cc Bb) = 16 birds? No, wait, each genotype is a single bird. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 4 birds: Checkered Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 8 birds: Checkered Checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 4 birds: Plain Brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 4 birds: Checkered Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 8 birds: Checkered Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 4 birds: Plain Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 4 birds: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 4 birds: Checkered",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. For each gene, if the dominant allele is expressed, the phenotype is present; otherwise, absent. So for the C locus: presence (red) vs absence (plain). For the B locus: presence (brown) vs absence (checkered). The presence of dominant alleles in both loci leads to the most complex phenotype. But let's approach this systematically.\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n\n1. Pigment color (C/B):\n   - If C is present, red\n   - If c is present, plain\n\n2. Body color (B/b):\n   - If B is present, brown\n   - If b is present, checkered\n\nThe phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\na. Red Brown (C B)\nb. Red Checkered (C b)\nc. Plain Brown (c B)\nd. Plain Checkered (c b)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of dominant alleles in each gene. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each combination of alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C (present): 1 (since CC and Cc are all red)\nWait, no\u2014wait, for the pigment color, the bird is either C (dominant, red) or c (recessive, plain). So the probability of having pigment color (C) is 100%, because any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having plain (c) is also 100%.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if the bird has a recessive allele (c), it will be plain, regardless of the other gene. So for pigment color, the bird will always be red if it has even one C allele. Similarly, for the body color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it will be brown.\n- If it has at least one b allele, it will be checkered.\n\nSo the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, which was CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Wait, no\u2014it's actually F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 would come from F1 (CcBb) selfing, producing four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each at 25% frequency.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype a: Red Brown (C B)\n\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype b: Red Checkered (C b)\n\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype c: Plain Brown (c B)\n\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype d: Plain Checkered (c b)\n\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that can't be right because adding up all probabilities (100% + 50% + 50% + 25%) equals 25%, which is less than 100%. That indicates a mistake in my calculation.\n\nAh, I see! Because each gene contributes independently, but the overall probability isn't simply additive like that. Instead, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations of the two genes. Each gene has two possibilities, so there are four possible phenotypes. But the probabilities aren't additive across them because each phenotype is defined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and then categorize them into phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Red Brown)\n5. Cc Bb (Red Checkered)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n7. cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n8. cc Bb (Checkered Checkered)\n9. cc bb (Checkered Brown)\n\nWait, but actually, each gene's possibilities are independent. So for pigment color, the bird can be RR (if RR?), but no\u2014since the bird is diploid, and each gene has two alleles. So for pigment color (C), the bird can be CC (red), Cc (red), or cc (plain). Similarly for B (B or b).\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Both dominant: C and B \u2192 Red Brown\n- C dominant, b \u2192 Red Checkered\n- c dominant, B \u2192 Plain Brown\n- c dominant, b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nSo now, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nSince the F2 generation is derived from F1 (CcBb) selfing, which gave 25% of each of the four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 population consists of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb or cB + CB)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each F2 genotype comes from the combination of two gametes. So the actual counts are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for example, the probability of being CC and BB is 25% * 25% = 6.25%. Similarly, the probability of CC and Bb is 25% * 50% = 12.5%.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. Red Brown (CC BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. Red Checkered (CC Bb): 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n3. Plain Brown (cc BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. Plain Checkered (cc Bb): 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. That suggests another error. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation combines all possible genotypes, and each genotype maps directly to a phenotype without needing to sum probabilities because each is distinct.\n\nWait, no, each genotype is unique, so the phenotypes correspond directly to the genotypes. So the probability for each phenotype is the same as the probability of that genotype. Thus, the four phenotypes have probabilities:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 50%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n\nBecause:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb: 50% (Red Checkered)\n- cc BB: 25% (Plain Brown)\n- cc Bb: 25% (Plain Checkered)\n\nAdding those up: 25% + 50% + 25% + 25% = 125%, which is impossible. This indicates that I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me clarify. Each F2 individual is a combination of two independent alleles from each parent. So, for the C locus:\n\n- Each parent contributes either C or c, and each has a 50% chance of contributing. So the probability of CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, and cc is 25%.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each locus's probabilities. So:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that totals to 100% because each combination is accounted for. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown (CC BB): 6.25%\n- Red Checkered (CC Bb): 12.5%\n- Plain Brown (cc BB): 6.25%\n- Plain Checkered (cc Bb): 12.5%\n\nWait, but that still sums to 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 37.5%, which is less than 100%. Something is wrong here. Maybe I'm missing some combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each F2 individual is a combination of the two genes, and the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Both genes dominant: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- C dominant, b: (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- c dominant, B: (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u219225%\n- c dominant, b: (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u219225%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 25%*4=100%. So each phenotype corresponds to exactly 25% of the F2 population.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% Red Brown, 25% Red Checkered, 25% Plain Brown, 25% Plain Checkered. So none of the options given seem to match this because all phenotypes have the same proportion. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions A through J don't have all four phenotypes equally represented. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 16%, which doesn't fit our 25% each. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, 25% each. Option H has checkered red 5, brown 3, red 2, brown 6. Still unequal. Option F has equal numbers (4 each). Option G has checkered red 12, brown 2, red 2, brown 0. Only 12+2+2+0=16. Option B has checkered red 8, brown 4, red 0, brown 4. Total 16. Option I has similar to B. Option J has checkered red 2, brown 6, red 3, brown 1. Also 12.\n\nWait, according to our analysis, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, so none of the options provide equal representation except option F and G, but F and G don't have equal parts. Option D has 1 + 3 + 9 +3 =16, which is 4 each, but that's not matching 25%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back. Each F2 individual can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability for each phenotype is indeed 25% because each gene contributes independently. So the expected phenotypic ratio should be 25% Red Brown : 25% Red Checkered : 25% Plain Brown : 25% Plain Checkered. But looking at the options:\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's 25% each, totaling 16 birds. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which matches 25% each.\n\nBut wait, the options say \"phenotypic ratio\" and \"genotypic frequencies\". Let me check the exact wording in the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16 birds. So the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That seems different from what I thought before. So perhaps my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. In the F2 generation, the number of birds is 16 (assuming each F2 individual is represented once). The phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 6\n- Plain brown: 2\n\nTotal: 16.\n\nSo the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 ratio 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 ratio 2:1:0:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 ratio 1:3:9:3, which is a geometric progression, suggesting a 27:9:3:1 ratio if scaled up, but it's presented differently.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 ratio 3:9:1:3, which is 3:9:1:3, but that's 16 birds. Summing 3+9+1+3=16. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to figure out how many birds are in each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will consist of 9 possible genotypes, but considering the probabilities, each genotype has a certain frequency.\n\nThe F2 genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. CC BB (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n2. CC Bb (probability 50%): Checkered Checkered\n3. CC bb (probability 25%): Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb (probability 50%): Checkered Checkered\n6. Cc bb (probability 25%): Plain Brown\n7. cc BB (probability 25%): Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb (probability 25%): Checkered Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 generation includes all possible combinations of the two genes, each with their own probabilities. So the actual counts are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- CC Bb: 50% of 16 = 8 birds\n- CC bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Cc BB: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Cc Bb: 50% of 16 = 8 birds\n- Cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- cc BB: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- cc Bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (4 birds)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (8 birds)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (4 birds)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (4 birds)\n5.

So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 4 (from CC BB) + 4 (Cc BB) + 4 (cc BB) + 4 (cc Bb) = 16 birds? No, wait, each genotype is a single bird. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 4 birds: Checkered Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 8 birds: Checkered Checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 4 birds: Plain Brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 4 birds: Checkered Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 8 birds: Checkered Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 4 birds: Plain Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 4 birds: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 4 birds: Checkered",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for pigment color: red or plain; for body color: brown or checkered.",
    "rollout": " So for pigment color: red or plain; for body color: brown or checkered. Thus, four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered\n3.

So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1, or simplifying, 4 parts red-brown, 2 parts red-checkered, 2 parts plain-brown, and 1 part plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the genes or the parents. Let me double-check the setup. The user wrote:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their setup. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the genes.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the genes are acting independently, but the phenotypes are determined by both genes. Let's consider the possible phenotypes again:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: 4/9\n- Pigment red and body checkered: 2/9\n- Pigment plain and body brown: 2/9\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: 1/9\n\nIf the user wants the ratio expressed as phenotypic classes without considering the underlying genetics, perhaps it's presented differently. Alternatively, maybe the user counted the number of each phenotype regardless of order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, treating each phenotype as having a certain count. Let's re-examine the F2 generation. In F2, each bird has a 25% chance of being each genotype. So:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Red, Brown)\n- 25% CcBb (Red, Checkered)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain, Brown)\n- 25% ccbb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nAssuming the user counts the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, the counts would be:\n\n- Red, Brown: 25% of F2 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Red, Checkered: 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Plain, Brown: 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Plain, Checkered: 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n\nWait, that sums to 16, so each phenotype would have 4 individuals. But that contradicts the earlier probability breakdown. Hmm, perhaps the user made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes different genotypes with different phenotypic expressions, and the counts are based on the actual number of each genotype.\n\nLet me recast the F2 generation:\n\nEach F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB (Red, Brown)\n- 1/4 CcBb (Red, Checkered)\n- 1/4 ccBB (Plain, Brown)\n- 1/4 ccbb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nAssuming that in the F2 generation, each bird is represented once, the counts would be:\n\n- Red, Brown: 4\n- Red, Checkered: 4\n- Plain, Brown: 4\n- Plain, Checkered: 4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, or simplified to 1:1:1:1, but the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the user is counting the number of each phenotype, not the number of genotypes. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown): 4\n- Phenotype 2 (Red, Checkered): 4\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): 4\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): 4\n\nTotal: 16. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back, perhaps the user interpreted the counts differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, irrespective of the actual number of genotypes. If the F2 generation is 16 birds, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Red, Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 2: Red, Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 3: Plain, Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 4: Plain, Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nThus, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which can also be written as 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the counts with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the dominance differently.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the user is considering the number of each phenotype based on how many times each phenotype appears across all possible gametes. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB (Red, Brown): 25%\n- CcBb (Red, Checkered): 25%\n- ccBB (Plain, Brown): 25%\n- ccbb (Plain, Checkered): 25%\n\nIf we treat each phenotype as a separate group, regardless of the underlying genotype probabilities, then each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. But since the options don't have 25%, perhaps the user summed them incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the user added the counts incorrectly.\n\nWait, looking at option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12. That doesn't sum to 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16, but what does that correspond to?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is adding the counts based on the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering the actual number of birds with each phenotype. But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAnother approach: Using a Punnett square to determine the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either CB or cb. The Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\n```\n      | C | c\n    -----------------\n    C | CC | Cc\n    -----------------\n    c | cC | cc\n```\n\nWait, no, the Punnett square for CcBb x CcBb would involve all possible combinations. Each gene is independent, so the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb (wait, no\u2014it's simpler: Cc x Cc gives CC, Cc, cC, cc. Similarly, Bb x Bb gives BB, Bb, bB, bb. So combining these, the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, each with equal frequency (25%). But the phenotypic expression depends on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Each gene has three possible phenotypes:\n\n- For pigment color (C): presence (red) vs absence (plain)\n- For body color (B): presence (brown) vs absence (checkered)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each gene. As previously calculated, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment dominant (C), body recessive (b): (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Pigment recessive (c), body dominant (B): (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Pigment recessive (c), body recessive (b): (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSumming these probabilities gives 1. To express the ratio in whole numbers, we can scale them to the smallest common multiple. The denominators are 9, 9, 9, 9, so scaling by 9 gives a ratio of 4:2:2:1. However, none of the answer choices match this exactly. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Summing these gives 16, which matches the total possible individuals. The ratio would be 12:2:2:0, which implies that only the first two phenotypes are present in larger quantities than the last two. But according to our calculation, all four phenotypes should be present. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the user considered the F2 generation to have only the F1 birds, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different method to calculate the phenotypic ratio, such as counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the actual number of birds with each phenotype. But without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the closest option that makes sense. Among the options, option G states a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which could imply that only some phenotypes are present. Alternatively, perhaps the user forgot to account for dominance, thinking that all recessive alleles are absent. But that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the genes. If instead, the B locus was determining the color and the C locus was determining pigment, but perhaps the user swapped the roles, leading to incorrect ratios. However, without further context, it's difficult to conclude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered only one gene at a time. For example, focusing on pigment color first: 4 red and 2 plain, giving a 4:2 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1. But this ignores the effect of the other gene. Alternatively, focusing on body color alone: 4 brown and 2 plain, ratio 2:1. But again, this ignores the interaction between the two genes.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the user focused solely on the presence of a particular gene, ignoring the other. For instance, if they looked at pigment color, ignoring the body color, they might see a 2:1 ratio (red:plain), but this doesn't align with any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user assumed that all recessive alleles are non-functional, but that leads to a ratio of 3:1, which is not among the options.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most plausible answer, despite discrepancies in the probabilities, is option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But this doesn't align with our calculation of 4:2:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user included the F1 generation in their analysis, leading to a different ratio. However, the question specifically asks about the F2 generation, so the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm unsure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color: red or plain; for body color: brown or checkered. Thus, four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered\n3. Pigment plain and body brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype. \n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 2/3 (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c): 1/3\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 2/3 (since B is dominant over b)\n- Absence (b): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and body brown (B)\nProbability = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b)\nProbability = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B)\nProbability = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b)\nProbability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nWait, that adds up to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 1, which checks out. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1, or simplifying, 4 parts red-brown, 2 parts red-checkered, 2 parts plain-brown, and 1 part plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the genes or the parents. Let me double-check the setup. The user wrote:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by dominant gene B, brown by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 would be CcBb (as each parent contributes CB gametes), and then F1 selfs to make F2.\n\nIn F2, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their setup. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the genes.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the genes are acting independently, but the phenotypes are determined by both genes. Let's consider the possible phenotypes again:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: 4/9\n- Pigment red and body checkered: 2/9\n- Pigment plain and body brown: 2/9\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: 1/9\n\nIf the user wants the ratio expressed as phenotypic classes without considering the underlying genetics, perhaps it's presented differently. Alternatively, maybe the user counted the number of each phenotype regardless of order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, treating each phenotype as having a certain count. Let's re-examine the F2 generation. In F2, each bird has a 25% chance of being each genotype. So:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Red, Brown)\n- 25% CcBb (Red, Checkered)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain, Brown)\n- 25% ccbb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nAssuming the user counts the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, the counts would be:\n\n- Red, Brown: 25% of F2 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Red, Checkered: 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Plain, Brown: 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Plain, Checkered: 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n\nWait, that sums to 16, so each phenotype would have 4 individuals. But that contradicts the earlier probability breakdown. Hmm, perhaps the user made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes different genotypes with different phenotypic expressions, and the counts are based on the actual number of each genotype.\n\nLet me recast the F2 generation:\n\nEach F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB (Red, Brown)\n- 1/4 CcBb (Red, Checkered)\n- 1/4 ccBB (Plain, Brown)\n- 1/4 ccbb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nAssuming that in the F2 generation, each bird is represented once, the counts would be:\n\n- Red, Brown: 4\n- Red, Checkered: 4\n- Plain, Brown: 4\n- Plain, Checkered: 4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, or simplified to 1:1:1:1, but the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the user is counting the number of each phenotype, not the number of genotypes. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown): 4\n- Phenotype 2 (Red, Checkered): 4\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): 4\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): 4\n\nTotal: 16. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back, perhaps the user interpreted the counts differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, irrespective of the actual number of genotypes. If the F2 generation is 16 birds, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Red, Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 2: Red, Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 3: Plain, Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 4: Plain, Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nThus, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which can also be written as 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the counts with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the dominance differently.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the user is considering the number of each phenotype based on how many times each phenotype appears across all possible gametes. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB (Red, Brown): 25%\n- CcBb (Red, Checkered): 25%\n- ccBB (Plain, Brown): 25%\n- ccbb (Plain, Checkered): 25%\n\nIf we treat each phenotype as a separate group, regardless of the underlying genotype probabilities, then each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. But since the options don't have 25%, perhaps the user summed them incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the user added the counts incorrectly.\n\nWait, looking at option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12. That doesn't sum to 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16, but what does that correspond to?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is adding the counts based on the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering the actual number of birds with each phenotype. But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAnother approach: Using a Punnett square to determine the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either CB or cb. The Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\n```\n      | C | c\n    -----------------\n    C | CC | Cc\n    -----------------\n    c | cC | cc\n```\n\nWait, no, the Punnett square for CcBb x CcBb would involve all possible combinations. Each gene is independent, so the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb (wait, no\u2014it's simpler: Cc x Cc gives CC, Cc, cC, cc. Similarly, Bb x Bb gives BB, Bb, bB, bb. So combining these, the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, each with equal frequency (25%). But the phenotypic expression depends on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Each gene has three possible phenotypes:\n\n- For pigment color (C): presence (red) vs absence (plain)\n- For body color (B): presence (brown) vs absence (checkered)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each gene. As previously calculated, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment dominant (C), body recessive (b): (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Pigment recessive (c), body dominant (B): (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Pigment recessive (c), body recessive (b): (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSumming these probabilities gives 1. To express the ratio in whole numbers, we can scale them to the smallest common multiple. The denominators are 9, 9, 9, 9, so scaling by 9 gives a ratio of 4:2:2:1. However, none of the answer choices match this exactly. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Summing these gives 16, which matches the total possible individuals. The ratio would be 12:2:2:0, which implies that only the first two phenotypes are present in larger quantities than the last two. But according to our calculation, all four phenotypes should be present. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the user considered the F2 generation to have only the F1 birds, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different method to calculate the phenotypic ratio, such as counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the actual number of birds with each phenotype. But without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the closest option that makes sense. Among the options, option G states a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which could imply that only some phenotypes are present. Alternatively, perhaps the user forgot to account for dominance, thinking that all recessive alleles are absent. But that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the genes. If instead, the B locus was determining the color and the C locus was determining pigment, but perhaps the user swapped the roles, leading to incorrect ratios. However, without further context, it's difficult to conclude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered only one gene at a time. For example, focusing on pigment color first: 4 red and 2 plain, giving a 4:2 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1. But this ignores the effect of the other gene. Alternatively, focusing on body color alone: 4 brown and 2 plain, ratio 2:1. But again, this ignores the interaction between the two genes.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the user focused solely on the presence of a particular gene, ignoring the other. For instance, if they looked at pigment color, ignoring the body color, they might see a 2:1 ratio (red:plain), but this doesn't align with any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user assumed that all recessive alleles are non-functional, but that leads to a ratio of 3:1, which is not among the options.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most plausible answer, despite discrepancies in the probabilities, is option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But this doesn't align with our calculation of 4:2:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user included the F1 generation in their analysis, leading to a different ratio. However, the question specifically asks about the F2 generation, so the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm unsure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene:",
    "rollout": " So for each gene:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- Present (Red): if at least one dominant allele (e.g., C)\n- Absent (Plain): if both alleles are recessive (e.g., c)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- Present (Brown): if at least one dominant allele (e.g., B)\n- Absent (Checkered): if both alleles are recessive (e.g., b)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each trait for the F2 generation.\n\nEach parent is heterozygous (CcBb), so the F1 is also CcBb (since it's selfing). Wait, no\u2014it's F1 from a cross between CC BB and cc bb, which results in CcBb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each gene, assuming independent assortment and no linkage. Wait, no\u2014that's true only if both loci assort independently. In reality, F2 would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bb. But since we're looking at the interaction of both genes, the combined phenotypes would be determined by how many of these combinations result in each phenotype.\n\nLet me list the possible genotypes for the F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake here. Each F2 bird has two copies of each gene, so for pigment (C/c):\n\n- 25% CC (Red)\n- 50% Cc (Red)\n- 25% cc (Plain)\n\nSimilarly for body color (B/b):\n\n- 25% BB (Brown)\n- 50% Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% bb (Plain)\n\nNow, the phenotype for each bird is a combination of these two traits. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to count how many of the nine possible combinations result in each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene has three possible outcomes, the total number of phenotypic combinations is 3\u00d73 = 9, but some combinations may overlap. Let's go through each possible genotype and assign the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount the phenotypes correctly:\n\nLooking back, the actual phenotype depends on whether each trait is expressed. So:\n\n- Pigment: Red (if at least one dominant allele)\n- Pigment: Plain (if both alleles are recessive)\n- Body Color: Brown (if at least one dominant allele)\n- Body Color: Checkered (if both alleles are recessive)\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let's make a table:\n\nBird | Pigment | Body Color | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC BB | Red | Brown | Checkered Red\nCC Bb | Red | Checkered | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Plain | Brown | Plain Red\nCc BB | Red | Brown | Checkered Red\nCc Bb | Red | Checkered | Checkered Brown\nCc bb | Plain | Brown | Plain Red\ncc BB | Plain | Brown | Plain Red\ncc Bb | Plain | Checkered | Plain Brown\ncc bb | Plain | Checkered | Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count the occurrences for each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: How many? Looking at rows where Pigment is Red and Body Color is Checkered. From the table, that's row 2, 4, 6, 9. That's 4 instances.\n- **Checkered Brown**: Rows where Pigment is Red and Body is Checkered. That's rows 2,4,6,9? Wait, no\u2014rows 2 and 4 are Pigment Red, Body Checkered; rows 6 and 9 are Pigment Plain, Body Checkered. Wait, no, from the table above, Pigment Red occurs in rows 1,2,4,6,7 (wait, no: Pigment Red is rows 1,2,4,6,7?), no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nWait, in my earlier table, Pigment Red is rows 1,2,4,6,7? No, wait: Looking back, Pigment Red is any bird where at least one C allele. So:\n\nRow 1: Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\nRow 2: Pigment Red, Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\nRow 4: Same as 2 \u2192 Checkered Brown\nRow 6: Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\nRow 7: Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\nRow 9: Pigment Plain, Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo Pigment Red is rows 1,2,4,6,7 \u2192 5 instances\nPigment Plain is rows 3,5,8 \u2192 3 instances\n\nBody Color Brown is rows 1,3,5,7,9 \u2192 5 instances\nBody Color Checkered is rows 2,4,6,8 \u2192 4 instances\n\nPhenotypes:\n- **Checkered Red**: 2 (rows 2,4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2 (rows 6,9)\n- **Plain Red**: 2 (rows 7,9?) Wait, no: Row 7 is Plain Red, row 9 is Plain Brown. So Plain Red is row 7, and Plain Brown is row 9. So 2 instances.\n- **Plain Brown**: 2 (rows 3,5,8\u2192 wait, no: Row 3 is Brown, row 5 is Brown, row 8 is Brown. So 3 instances)\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1 (row 8)\nWait, no: Pigment Plain is rows 3,5,8. Body Checkered is row 8. So row 8 is both Pigment Plain and Body Checkered, so Phenotype Plain Checkered.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2\n- **Plain Red**: 2\n- **Plain Brown**: 3\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: Rows 2,4 \u2192 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: Rows 6,9 \u2192 2\n- **Plain Red**: Rows 7,9 \u2192 2\n- **Plain Brown**: Rows 3,5,8 \u2192 3\n- **Plain Checkered**: Row 8 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 2+2+2+3+1 = 10, but wait, the F2 generation is 16 birds, but according to the options given, none match exactly. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me go through each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Plain Red\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Brown\n6. Plain Red\n7. Plain Red\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Checkered\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2 (1,4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2 (2,5)\n- **Plain Red**: 3 (3,6,7)\n- **Plain Brown**: 1 (8)\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1 (9)\n\nWait, that totals 2+2+3+1+1=9, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I missed some cases. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was better.\n\nAnother approach: Calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the dihybrid cross. Since both genes are independent and dominant, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each trait separately, but combined as 9:3:3:1 for both traits. But I might be confusing the approaches.\n\nWait, no\u2014when both traits are influenced by the same two genes, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive. Instead, it's the product of the individual ratios. Since each gene contributes three phenotypic categories, the total phenotypic categories are 3\u00d73=9, but overlapping occurs when both traits are present in certain ways.\n\nThe standard F2 dihybrid cross phenotypic ratio when both traits are influenced by the same two genes is indeed 9:3:3:1 for each trait individually, but when considering both traits together, it becomes more complex due to overlapping phenotypes. However, in this case, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by counting the combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio for F2 would be:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2/9\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2/9\n- **Plain Red**: 3/9\n- **Plain Brown**: 1/9\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1/9\n\nWait, but adding these up: 2+2+3+1+1=9, which suggests each is divided by 9. However, the options don't include fractions like 2/9; instead, they present whole numbers. So perhaps the options are presented in terms of counts, not proportions. If that's the case, then the counts would be:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2\n- **Plain Red**: 3\n- **Plain Brown**: 1\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1\n\nAdding these up gives 2+2+3+1+1=9, but the F2 generation should have 16 birds. This discrepancy suggests that either the initial assumption is wrong or the approach needs adjustment.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is by considering the F2 dihybrid cross without considering linked genes, assuming independent assortment. The possible phenotypic combinations would be determined by the interactions of the two genes. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. \n\nTo calculate the exact number of each phenotype, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Identify the possible genotypes for each trait.\n2. Combine them to get the possible phenotypes.\n3. Count the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler method is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, and thus the F2 phenotypic ratio can be derived from the dihybrid cross. \n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each trait alone, but when considering both traits, the phenotypic ratio becomes more complex. However, since both traits are influenced by the same two genes, the phenotypic ratio remains the same as the dihybrid cross, resulting in 9:3:3:1 for each trait, but when combined, it still holds. However, this seems contradictory because the phenotypes are interdependent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to list all possible phenotypes and count them based on the dihybrid cross.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both the pigment and body color traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment Red & Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Pigment Red & Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Pigment Plain & Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pigment Plain & Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Pigment Red & Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that might not cover all possibilities correctly. Let me systematically go through each bird's phenotype.\n\nFrom the previous table, the phenotypes were:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Plain Red\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Brown\n6. Plain Red\n7. Plain Red\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2\n- **Plain Red**: 3 (rows 3,6,7)\n- **Plain Brown**: 1 (row 8)\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1 (row 9)\n\nTotal: 2+2+3+1+1=9, which suggests a ratio of 2:2:3:1:1 across the five phenotypes. But since the F2 generation has 16 birds, this indicates that my initial approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider the possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes. Given that, let me proceed differently.\n\nWhen performing a dihybrid cross (like in this case), the F2 generation will have a specific phenotypic ratio based on the genetic makeup of the parents. The key is to determine how many of the 16 birds will exhibit each phenotype.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross (where F1 is CcBb). The Punnett square will have 16 cells, each representing a possible genotype for the offspring.\n\nThe F1 bird is CcBb. So when crossed with itself, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nThese correspond to the 9 possible genotypic combinations. Now, I'll convert these into phenotypes based on the rules:\n\n- **Pigment (C)**: \n  - C present \u2192 Pigment Red\n  - Both alleles recessive (cc) \u2192 Pigment Plain\n- **Body Color (B)**:\n  - B present \u2192 Body Brown\n  - Both alleles recessive (bb) \u2192 Body Checkered\n\nSo each genotype maps to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: Rows 1,4 \u2192 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: Rows 2,5 \u2192 2\n- **Plain Red**: Rows 3,6,7 \u2192 3\n- **Plain Brown**: Row 8 \u2192 1\n- **Plain Checkered**: Row 9 \u2192 1\n\nSo the counts are 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, totaling 9, but since the F2 generation has 16 birds, this suggests that the initial approach is missing something. Perhaps the confusion arises because the F2 generation includes both the genotypic and phenotypic contributions, and the counts must add up to 16.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, each with a distinct genotype, which maps directly to a distinct phenotype. My previous counts assumed that each genotype leads to a unique phenotype, but actually, some genotypes may result in the same phenotype. For example, in the dihybrid cross, different genotypic combinations can yield the same phenotypic outcome.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. The issue is that multiple genotypic combinations can lead to the same phenotype. For instance, the genotypes CcBb and ccBB could both result in Pigment Red and Body Brown, hence being classified under the same phenotype category. Similarly, other genotypes may share the same phenotype.\n\nTherefore, I cannot simply count the number of each genotype and assume that each corresponds to a unique phenotype. Instead, I need to categorize the genotypes into phenotypic categories and then sum the probabilities accordingly.\n\nThis complicates things. Let me re-examine the process.\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by crossing F1 (CcBb) x (CcBb). The F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, F1 is CcBb, so when forming gametes, it can produce:\n\n- 25% CB (from CcBb)\n- 25% cb (from CcBb)\n- 25% cB (from CcBb)\n- 25% cb (from CcBb)\n\nWait, no, the correct gametes from CcBb are:\n\n- 25% CB (from C and B alleles)\n- 25% cB (from c and B alleles)\n- 25% cB (from c and B alleles)\n- 25% cb (from c and b alleles)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each allele pair segregates independently, so the correct gametes are:\n\n- From Cc (for C):\n  - 50% C\n  - 50% c\n- From Bb (for B):\n  - 50% B\n  - 50% b\n\nThus, the gametes are all possible combinations: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross will have 16 possible combinations, each occurring once (since each gamete is equally likely).\n\nNow, mapping each",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each gene:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- Present (Red): if at least one dominant allele (e.g., C)\n- Absent (Plain): if both alleles are recessive (e.g., c)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- Present (Brown): if at least one dominant allele (e.g., B)\n- Absent (Checkered): if both alleles are recessive (e.g., b)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each trait for the F2 generation.\n\nEach parent is heterozygous (CcBb), so the F1 is also CcBb (since it's selfing). Wait, no\u2014it's F1 from a cross between CC BB and cc bb, which results in CcBb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each gene, assuming independent assortment and no linkage. Wait, no\u2014that's true only if both loci assort independently. In reality, F2 would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bb. But since we're looking at the interaction of both genes, the combined phenotypes would be determined by how many of these combinations result in each phenotype.\n\nLet me list the possible genotypes for the F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake here. Each F2 bird has two copies of each gene, so for pigment (C/c):\n\n- 25% CC (Red)\n- 50% Cc (Red)\n- 25% cc (Plain)\n\nSimilarly for body color (B/b):\n\n- 25% BB (Brown)\n- 50% Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% bb (Plain)\n\nNow, the phenotype for each bird is a combination of these two traits. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to count how many of the nine possible combinations result in each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene has three possible outcomes, the total number of phenotypic combinations is 3\u00d73 = 9, but some combinations may overlap. Let's go through each possible genotype and assign the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Red, Body: Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment: Plain, Body: Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount the phenotypes correctly:\n\nLooking back, the actual phenotype depends on whether each trait is expressed. So:\n\n- Pigment: Red (if at least one dominant allele)\n- Pigment: Plain (if both alleles are recessive)\n- Body Color: Brown (if at least one dominant allele)\n- Body Color: Checkered (if both alleles are recessive)\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let's make a table:\n\nBird | Pigment | Body Color | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC BB | Red | Brown | Checkered Red\nCC Bb | Red | Checkered | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Plain | Brown | Plain Red\nCc BB | Red | Brown | Checkered Red\nCc Bb | Red | Checkered | Checkered Brown\nCc bb | Plain | Brown | Plain Red\ncc BB | Plain | Brown | Plain Red\ncc Bb | Plain | Checkered | Plain Brown\ncc bb | Plain | Checkered | Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count the occurrences for each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: How many? Looking at rows where Pigment is Red and Body Color is Checkered. From the table, that's row 2, 4, 6, 9. That's 4 instances.\n- **Checkered Brown**: Rows where Pigment is Red and Body is Checkered. That's rows 2,4,6,9? Wait, no\u2014rows 2 and 4 are Pigment Red, Body Checkered; rows 6 and 9 are Pigment Plain, Body Checkered. Wait, no, from the table above, Pigment Red occurs in rows 1,2,4,6,7 (wait, no: Pigment Red is rows 1,2,4,6,7?), no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nWait, in my earlier table, Pigment Red is rows 1,2,4,6,7? No, wait: Looking back, Pigment Red is any bird where at least one C allele. So:\n\nRow 1: Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\nRow 2: Pigment Red, Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\nRow 4: Same as 2 \u2192 Checkered Brown\nRow 6: Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\nRow 7: Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\nRow 9: Pigment Plain, Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo Pigment Red is rows 1,2,4,6,7 \u2192 5 instances\nPigment Plain is rows 3,5,8 \u2192 3 instances\n\nBody Color Brown is rows 1,3,5,7,9 \u2192 5 instances\nBody Color Checkered is rows 2,4,6,8 \u2192 4 instances\n\nPhenotypes:\n- **Checkered Red**: 2 (rows 2,4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2 (rows 6,9)\n- **Plain Red**: 2 (rows 7,9?) Wait, no: Row 7 is Plain Red, row 9 is Plain Brown. So Plain Red is row 7, and Plain Brown is row 9. So 2 instances.\n- **Plain Brown**: 2 (rows 3,5,8\u2192 wait, no: Row 3 is Brown, row 5 is Brown, row 8 is Brown. So 3 instances)\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1 (row 8)\nWait, no: Pigment Plain is rows 3,5,8. Body Checkered is row 8. So row 8 is both Pigment Plain and Body Checkered, so Phenotype Plain Checkered.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2\n- **Plain Red**: 2\n- **Plain Brown**: 3\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: Rows 2,4 \u2192 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: Rows 6,9 \u2192 2\n- **Plain Red**: Rows 7,9 \u2192 2\n- **Plain Brown**: Rows 3,5,8 \u2192 3\n- **Plain Checkered**: Row 8 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 2+2+2+3+1 = 10, but wait, the F2 generation is 16 birds, but according to the options given, none match exactly. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me go through each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Plain Red\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Brown\n6. Plain Red\n7. Plain Red\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Checkered\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2 (1,4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2 (2,5)\n- **Plain Red**: 3 (3,6,7)\n- **Plain Brown**: 1 (8)\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1 (9)\n\nWait, that totals 2+2+3+1+1=9, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I missed some cases. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was better.\n\nAnother approach: Calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the dihybrid cross. Since both genes are independent and dominant, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each trait separately, but combined as 9:3:3:1 for both traits. But I might be confusing the approaches.\n\nWait, no\u2014when both traits are influenced by the same two genes, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive. Instead, it's the product of the individual ratios. Since each gene contributes three phenotypic categories, the total phenotypic categories are 3\u00d73=9, but overlapping occurs when both traits are present in certain ways.\n\nThe standard F2 dihybrid cross phenotypic ratio when both traits are influenced by the same two genes is indeed 9:3:3:1 for each trait individually, but when considering both traits together, it becomes more complex due to overlapping phenotypes. However, in this case, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by counting the combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio for F2 would be:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2/9\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2/9\n- **Plain Red**: 3/9\n- **Plain Brown**: 1/9\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1/9\n\nWait, but adding these up: 2+2+3+1+1=9, which suggests each is divided by 9. However, the options don't include fractions like 2/9; instead, they present whole numbers. So perhaps the options are presented in terms of counts, not proportions. If that's the case, then the counts would be:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2\n- **Plain Red**: 3\n- **Plain Brown**: 1\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1\n\nAdding these up gives 2+2+3+1+1=9, but the F2 generation should have 16 birds. This discrepancy suggests that either the initial assumption is wrong or the approach needs adjustment.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is by considering the F2 dihybrid cross without considering linked genes, assuming independent assortment. The possible phenotypic combinations would be determined by the interactions of the two genes. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. \n\nTo calculate the exact number of each phenotype, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Identify the possible genotypes for each trait.\n2. Combine them to get the possible phenotypes.\n3. Count the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler method is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, and thus the F2 phenotypic ratio can be derived from the dihybrid cross. \n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each trait alone, but when considering both traits, the phenotypic ratio becomes more complex. However, since both traits are influenced by the same two genes, the phenotypic ratio remains the same as the dihybrid cross, resulting in 9:3:3:1 for each trait, but when combined, it still holds. However, this seems contradictory because the phenotypes are interdependent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to list all possible phenotypes and count them based on the dihybrid cross.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both the pigment and body color traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment Red & Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Pigment Red & Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Pigment Plain & Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pigment Plain & Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Pigment Red & Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that might not cover all possibilities correctly. Let me systematically go through each bird's phenotype.\n\nFrom the previous table, the phenotypes were:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Plain Red\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Brown\n6. Plain Red\n7. Plain Red\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 2\n- **Plain Red**: 3 (rows 3,6,7)\n- **Plain Brown**: 1 (row 8)\n- **Plain Checkered**: 1 (row 9)\n\nTotal: 2+2+3+1+1=9, which suggests a ratio of 2:2:3:1:1 across the five phenotypes. But since the F2 generation has 16 birds, this indicates that my initial approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider the possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes. Given that, let me proceed differently.\n\nWhen performing a dihybrid cross (like in this case), the F2 generation will have a specific phenotypic ratio based on the genetic makeup of the parents. The key is to determine how many of the 16 birds will exhibit each phenotype.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross (where F1 is CcBb). The Punnett square will have 16 cells, each representing a possible genotype for the offspring.\n\nThe F1 bird is CcBb. So when crossed with itself, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nThese correspond to the 9 possible genotypic combinations. Now, I'll convert these into phenotypes based on the rules:\n\n- **Pigment (C)**: \n  - C present \u2192 Pigment Red\n  - Both alleles recessive (cc) \u2192 Pigment Plain\n- **Body Color (B)**:\n  - B present \u2192 Body Brown\n  - Both alleles recessive (bb) \u2192 Body Checkered\n\nSo each genotype maps to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment Red, Body Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Brown \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment Plain, Body Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: Rows 1,4 \u2192 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: Rows 2,5 \u2192 2\n- **Plain Red**: Rows 3,6,7 \u2192 3\n- **Plain Brown**: Row 8 \u2192 1\n- **Plain Checkered**: Row 9 \u2192 1\n\nSo the counts are 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, totaling 9, but since the F2 generation has 16 birds, this suggests that the initial approach is missing something. Perhaps the confusion arises because the F2 generation includes both the genotypic and phenotypic contributions, and the counts must add up to 16.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, each with a distinct genotype, which maps directly to a distinct phenotype. My previous counts assumed that each genotype leads to a unique phenotype, but actually, some genotypes may result in the same phenotype. For example, in the dihybrid cross, different genotypic combinations can yield the same phenotypic outcome.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. The issue is that multiple genotypic combinations can lead to the same phenotype. For instance, the genotypes CcBb and ccBB could both result in Pigment Red and Body Brown, hence being classified under the same phenotype category. Similarly, other genotypes may share the same phenotype.\n\nTherefore, I cannot simply count the number of each genotype and assume that each corresponds to a unique phenotype. Instead, I need to categorize the genotypes into phenotypic categories and then sum the probabilities accordingly.\n\nThis complicates things. Let me re-examine the process.\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by crossing F1 (CcBb) x (CcBb). The F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, F1 is CcBb, so when forming gametes, it can produce:\n\n- 25% CB (from CcBb)\n- 25% cb (from CcBb)\n- 25% cB (from CcBb)\n- 25% cb (from CcBb)\n\nWait, no, the correct gametes from CcBb are:\n\n- 25% CB (from C and B alleles)\n- 25% cB (from c and B alleles)\n- 25% cB (from c and B alleles)\n- 25% cb (from c and b alleles)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each allele pair segregates independently, so the correct gametes are:\n\n- From Cc (for C):\n  - 50% C\n  - 50% c\n- From Bb (for B):\n  - 50% B\n  - 50% b\n\nThus, the gametes are all possible combinations: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross will have 16 possible combinations, each occurring once (since each gamete is equally likely).\n\nNow, mapping each",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "rollout": " Since each gene has two alleles, and each trait is determined by whether the allele is dominant or recessive, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Plain brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain checkered\n\nBut wait, the user defined the phenotype as \"red\" vs \"plain\" and \"brown\" vs \"checkered.\" So the four phenotypes are: Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Assuming Mendelian inheritance, each allele is equally likely to be passed on. So for the C locus: 50% chance of C (red) or c (plain). Similarly, for the B locus: 50% chance of B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_B: Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_b: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. c_B: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain red\n4. c_b: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency in the F2 generation. However, looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly, but let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because the F2 isn't just a simple 2x2 grid due to dominance and blending. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the crossing. Let me re-examine the question. The question says: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014that seems different from what I thought earlier. In an adihybridcross, both parents are heterozygotes. Here, the parents are homozygous: one is CC BB (homozygous checkered red), and the other is cc bb (homozygous plain brown). That changes things because the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would follow standard Mendelian rules.\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross,\" which usually involves two heterozygotes. Here, one parent is homozygous, so perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Let me clarify: If the parents are both homozygous (one CC BB, another cc bb), then their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be based on their selfing. So the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with a certain frequency, leading to four phenotypes. From earlier analysis, each phenotype would occur at 25%, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But none of the options seem to reflect that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Let me read the original question again: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, one is homozygous (CC BB), and the other is homozygous (cc bb). So their F1 is CcBb, and F2 follows.\n\nSo, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nEach of these leads to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSince each of these four genotypes has an equal probability (25%), each phenotype appears once every four birds, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer choices, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Perhaps I've missed something else. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of each phenotype rather than their ratio. Looking at option G: phenotypic ratio 12:2:2:2. That adds up to 18, but the sum of all is 1+1+1+1=4 parts. Option D: 1:3:9:3, which doesn't fit our scenario. Option E: 3:9:1:3, also different. Option J: 2:6:3:1, still not matching. Option B: 8:4:0:4, adding up to 16. Option A: 6:2:6:2, totaling 16. Option C: 9:3:3:1, totaling 16. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which fits our 1:1:1:1 ratio scaled by 4. Wait, that makes sense because each phenotype would appear 4 times in a sample of 16 birds. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, option F shows 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:1 when divided by 4. So perhaps the answer is F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount. Each of the four genotypes (phenotypes) has 25% chance. If we take a large sample, say 100 birds, 25 would be each phenotype. So the ratio would be 25:25:25:25, which is 1:1:1:1. But none of the options have this exact format except option F, which states checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This matches because each phenotype would have 25% of 100, which is 25 each. Wait, but the options don't list 25:25:25:25; instead, option F lists 4:4:4:4. That must be a typo, but according to the options, option F is the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) will indeed produce phenotypes in the ratio of 9:3:3:1. Here's why: For each gene, the probability of the dominant allele (C or B) is 3/4, and the recessive (c or b) is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Red Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Red Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014that doesn't add up to 1. Because 9+3+3+1=16, so yes, each fraction represents the proportion. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts Red Brown, 3 Red Checkered, 3 Plain Brown, 1 Plain Checkered.\n\nBut now, looking at the options given, none directly match this. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio after the F2 generation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me create a table for each bird:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n- Dominant (C): Red\n- Recessive (c): Plain\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- Dominant (B): Brown\n- Recessive (b): Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes for each bird are combinations of these two traits. There are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B)\n2. Red Checkered (C_b)\n3. Plain Brown (c_B)\n4. Plain Checkered (c_b)\n\nNow, to determine how many birds have each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being present.\n\nFirst, let's determine the genotype ratios in F2. Since each bird is produced from a selfing of F1, which was a dihybrid (CcBb), the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance. Wait, but let me confirm that.

Because 9+3+3+1=16, so yes, each fraction represents the proportion. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts Red Brown, 3 Red Checkered, 3 Plain Brown, 1 Plain Checkered.\n\nBut now, looking at the options given, none directly match this.

    "rollout": " So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red bird\n2. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Plain red bird\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) would be Checkered brown. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) could also be plain red. Wait, no\u2014I think I need to clarify. The bird's phenotype depends on both genes. If the bird is C (pigment red) and B (brown), then it's a Checkered brown. If it's C (pigment red) and b (checkered), it's a Plain red. Similarly, if it's cc (plain) and B (brown), it's Checkered brown. And if it's cc (plain) and b (checkered), it's Plain checkered.\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (C_B_)\n2. Plain red (C_b_)\n3. Checkered brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, the probability for each class would be determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. For each gene, the probability is 50% for each allele. So the probability for each phenotype is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, so 25% for each phenotype. But wait, let's make sure. Alternatively, since each gene has two alleles, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor C: CC (pigment red), Cc (pigment red), cc (plain)\nFor B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nThe combination of these genotypes leads to the phenotypes. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for example, the probability of having pigment red (C_) and brown (B_) is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, so 25%. Similarly for each phenotype:\n\nCheckered brown (c_B_): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nPlain red (C_b_): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nCheckered brown (c_B_): same as above\nPlain checkered (c_b_): same as above\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 25% for each phenotype. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H list various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 4:4:0:4, etc. None of them say 25%, so I must have misunderstood something. Maybe the user made a mistake in setting up the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't being considered correctly. Wait, the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the F2 refers to the F2 of the F1 generation, which itself is the F1 of the original parents. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F2 generation of the dihybrid cross between the two parents. Either way, perhaps my approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation instead of F2, but that doesn't align with the question. Let me re-examine the setup. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F1 selfs to get F2, which is what the question is asking about. So the F2 phenotypes would follow the Mendelian ratios for two loci. Each gene has two alleles, so each locus has three possible phenotypes (presence/absence of the allele). However, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios combine the effects of both genes. \n\nEach gene contributes a factor of 2 (two phenotypes) for each, leading to 4 possible phenotypic classes. As previously determined, each has a 25% chance. However, none of the options match 25% for each phenotype. This suggests that either the user made a mistake in presenting the options or perhaps I've misinterpreted the question.\n\nWait, looking again at the options provided, option D states a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which might imply a different scenario. Perhaps the user confused the number of traits or miscounted the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a monohybrid cross, but no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 of the F1 cross, making it the F2 of the original parents. That seems unlikely.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the dihybrid cross involves two genes, each with two alleles, leading to four possible phenotypes. The expected ratios for each phenotype would be 1:2:1:2 if each gene is segregating independently, but that's not exactly the case here because each bird's phenotype combines both genes. Actually, the standard dihybrid cross yields a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's when each trait is expressed independently. In this case, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios for each of the four combinations would each be 25%.\n\nGiven that, the options do not reflect 25% for each phenotype. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me double-check the problem statement. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c for the checkering gene, and the checkered color is due to the recessive allele b for the pigment gene. Pigment color is determined by the dominant allele B. Red is dominant over plain (c).\n\nSo, the bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Each bird's genotype will determine their phenotype based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. C is dominant, b is recessive: C_b_ \u2192 Plain red\n3. c is recessive, B is dominant: c_B_ \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both genes are recessive: c_b_ \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is indeed 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options. Hence, perhaps the user intended to ask about a different scenario or made a mistake in the options presented.\n\nLooking back at the options, perhaps the user meant the F1 generation instead of F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and its phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered brown\n- C_b_: Plain red\n- c_B_: Checkered brown\n- c_b_: Plain checkered\n\nAssuming equal distribution, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2:2:2, but that simplifies to 1:1:1:1, which still doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the F1 as the F2 of the F1 cross, which wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a monohybrid cross, but that's not stated.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user intended to ask about the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross without considering the recessive traits properly, but I can't see how that would change the outcome unless there's a miscalculation in the probabilities.\n\nGiven that none of the options seem to fit the expected 25% ratio, perhaps the correct answer is E, which has a ratio of 3:1:3:1, suggesting a different kind of inheritance. Alternatively, perhaps the user included an extra recessive allele, but that's not indicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given that, I'll have to proceed under the assumption that the correct ratio is 25% for each phenotype, but since that's not an option, I'll select the closest one, which might be D, but that doesn't add up either.\n\nWait, let me calculate the actual number of individuals for each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming the parents are heterozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 would be CcBb, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following:\n\n- For each gene, the F1 can produce gametes with C (50%) and c (50%). So for each gene, the proportion of each allele in the gametes is 50% C and 50% c.\n- Combining the two genes, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (p pigment red, brown)\n- 25% Cc (p pigment red, plain)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown, checkered)\n- 25% Bb (brown, plain)\n- 25% bb (checkered, checkered)\n- 25% bb (checkered, plain)\n\nHowever, when considering both genes together, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes' phenotypes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Checkered brown\n2. C_b_: Plain red\n3. c_B_: Checkered brown\n4. c_b_: Plain checkered\n\nAnd each of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options provided don't include this. Therefore, I must conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back to the user's question, they asked for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. The options are A through J, with varying ratios. Perhaps I should recalculate the actual counts for each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's assume each parent is heterozygous for both genes. The F1 is CcBb, which produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations of gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nThis results in the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all C and B alleles)\n- 25% CC Bb (C and B)\n- 25% CC bb (C and b)\n- 25% CC bb (same as above)\nWait, perhaps better to count each possible combination:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. C_B_: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes. Looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, but this is incorrect. The correct breakdown would involve each genotype contributing to the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each combination of C and B will lead to a specific phenotype. Since each gene is independent, the number of each phenotype is (number of C alleles \u00d7 number of B alleles)/4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red bird\n2. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Plain red bird\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) would be Checkered brown. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) could also be plain red. Wait, no\u2014I think I need to clarify. The bird's phenotype depends on both genes. If the bird is C (pigment red) and B (brown), then it's a Checkered brown. If it's C (pigment red) and b (checkered), it's a Plain red. Similarly, if it's cc (plain) and B (brown), it's Checkered brown. And if it's cc (plain) and b (checkered), it's Plain checkered.\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (C_B_)\n2. Plain red (C_b_)\n3. Checkered brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, the probability for each class would be determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. For each gene, the probability is 50% for each allele. So the probability for each phenotype is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, so 25% for each phenotype. But wait, let's make sure. Alternatively, since each gene has two alleles, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor C: CC (pigment red), Cc (pigment red), cc (plain)\nFor B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nThe combination of these genotypes leads to the phenotypes. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for example, the probability of having pigment red (C_) and brown (B_) is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, so 25%. Similarly for each phenotype:\n\nCheckered brown (c_B_): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nPlain red (C_b_): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nCheckered brown (c_B_): same as above\nPlain checkered (c_b_): same as above\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 25% for each phenotype. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H list various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 4:4:0:4, etc. None of them say 25%, so I must have misunderstood something. Maybe the user made a mistake in setting up the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't being considered correctly. Wait, the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the F2 refers to the F2 of the F1 generation, which itself is the F1 of the original parents. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F2 generation of the dihybrid cross between the two parents. Either way, perhaps my approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation instead of F2, but that doesn't align with the question. Let me re-examine the setup. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F1 selfs to get F2, which is what the question is asking about. So the F2 phenotypes would follow the Mendelian ratios for two loci. Each gene has two alleles, so each locus has three possible phenotypes (presence/absence of the allele). However, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios combine the effects of both genes. \n\nEach gene contributes a factor of 2 (two phenotypes) for each, leading to 4 possible phenotypic classes. As previously determined, each has a 25% chance. However, none of the options match 25% for each phenotype. This suggests that either the user made a mistake in presenting the options or perhaps I've misinterpreted the question.\n\nWait, looking again at the options provided, option D states a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which might imply a different scenario. Perhaps the user confused the number of traits or miscounted the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a monohybrid cross, but no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 of the F1 cross, making it the F2 of the original parents. That seems unlikely.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the dihybrid cross involves two genes, each with two alleles, leading to four possible phenotypes. The expected ratios for each phenotype would be 1:2:1:2 if each gene is segregating independently, but that's not exactly the case here because each bird's phenotype combines both genes. Actually, the standard dihybrid cross yields a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's when each trait is expressed independently. In this case, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios for each of the four combinations would each be 25%.\n\nGiven that, the options do not reflect 25% for each phenotype. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me double-check the problem statement. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c for the checkering gene, and the checkered color is due to the recessive allele b for the pigment gene. Pigment color is determined by the dominant allele B. Red is dominant over plain (c).\n\nSo, the bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Each bird's genotype will determine their phenotype based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. C is dominant, b is recessive: C_b_ \u2192 Plain red\n3. c is recessive, B is dominant: c_B_ \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both genes are recessive: c_b_ \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is indeed 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options. Hence, perhaps the user intended to ask about a different scenario or made a mistake in the options presented.\n\nLooking back at the options, perhaps the user meant the F1 generation instead of F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and its phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered brown\n- C_b_: Plain red\n- c_B_: Checkered brown\n- c_b_: Plain checkered\n\nAssuming equal distribution, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2:2:2, but that simplifies to 1:1:1:1, which still doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the F1 as the F2 of the F1 cross, which wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a monohybrid cross, but that's not stated.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user intended to ask about the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross without considering the recessive traits properly, but I can't see how that would change the outcome unless there's a miscalculation in the probabilities.\n\nGiven that none of the options seem to fit the expected 25% ratio, perhaps the correct answer is E, which has a ratio of 3:1:3:1, suggesting a different kind of inheritance. Alternatively, perhaps the user included an extra recessive allele, but that's not indicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given that, I'll have to proceed under the assumption that the correct ratio is 25% for each phenotype, but since that's not an option, I'll select the closest one, which might be D, but that doesn't add up either.\n\nWait, let me calculate the actual number of individuals for each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming the parents are heterozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 would be CcBb, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following:\n\n- For each gene, the F1 can produce gametes with C (50%) and c (50%). So for each gene, the proportion of each allele in the gametes is 50% C and 50% c.\n- Combining the two genes, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (p pigment red, brown)\n- 25% Cc (p pigment red, plain)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown, checkered)\n- 25% Bb (brown, plain)\n- 25% bb (checkered, checkered)\n- 25% bb (checkered, plain)\n\nHowever, when considering both genes together, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes' phenotypes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Checkered brown\n2. C_b_: Plain red\n3. c_B_: Checkered brown\n4. c_b_: Plain checkered\n\nAnd each of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options provided don't include this. Therefore, I must conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back to the user's question, they asked for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. The options are A through J, with varying ratios. Perhaps I should recalculate the actual counts for each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's assume each parent is heterozygous for both genes. The F1 is CcBb, which produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations of gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nThis results in the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all C and B alleles)\n- 25% CC Bb (C and B)\n- 25% CC bb (C and b)\n- 25% CC bb (same as above)\nWait, perhaps better to count each possible combination:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. C_B_: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes. Looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, but this is incorrect. The correct breakdown would involve each genotype contributing to the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each combination of C and B will lead to a specific phenotype. Since each gene is independent, the number of each phenotype is (number of C alleles \u00d7 number of B alleles)/4. But perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that each of the four phenotypes will occur equally in the F2 generation, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Thus, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. Therefore, I must consider that perhaps the user intended a different scenario, such as a monohybrid cross.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes.",
    "rollout": " So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes.\n\nWait, but in reality, it's more accurate to consider that each gene contributes to one trait, and the presence of dominant alleles results in the trait being expressed. So for pigment color (C/B), the bird is either red (C present) or plain (c present). Similarly, for body color (B/b), it's either brown (B present) or checkered (b present). So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. So four phenotypes in total. However, some phenotypes may not be observed if certain alleles are absent. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 will have a mix of these phenotypes based on their genotype distribution.\n\nSo let's calculate the F2 phenotypic ratio. Each gene is segregating into two possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele), so combined, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypic classes. However, since the genes are independent, each class will occur with a probability equal to the product of the probabilities of each gene's segregation. Since both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1 will be heterozygous (CcBb), and the F2 will be the result of independent assortment for each gene, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypic classes. But let's verify that.\n\nFor the C locus: The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So for C:\n- CB: C (dominant)\n- cb: c (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for B locus: F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (both C's dominant)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, c recessive)\n- 25% cc (both recessive)\n- 25% bb\n\nBut now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: pigment red (since C is dominant) and B present (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc: pigment red (C dominant) and B absent (checkered) \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc: pigment plain (c) and B present (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n- bb: pigment plain (c) and B absent (checkered) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype do we expect? Since each gene segregates 50%, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across all four phenotypes. However, wait\u2014is that true? Because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are combinations. But since each trait is determined independently, the phenotypic ratios should indeed be 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me look at the options:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, etc. That suggests that the answer is probably based on the number of offspring in each category rather than a simple 1:1:1:1 ratio because the parents are homozygous and the cross might lead to different phenotypic counts due to dominance and blending.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself. Let's construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes:\n- From C locus: C (from CC) or c (from cc)\n- From B locus: B (from BB) or b (from bb)\n\nEach gamete combines one allele from each locus. So the gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Now, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C present), Body color brown (B present) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C present), Body color checkered (b present) \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc: Pigment plain (c present), Body color brown (B present) \u2192 plain-brown\n- bb: Pigment plain (c present), Body color checkered (b present) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype will there be? Since each gene segregates into two possible outcomes equally, the F2 should have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Instead, the options suggest that the phenotypic ratio is something else, like option D (1,3,9,3) or others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem isn't asking for a 1:1:1:1 ratio but instead expects us to consider the actual number of individuals in each phenotype group based on the possible gamete combinations, taking into account dominance and blending. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to count the number of each type of gamete and then determine the phenotypic ratio accordingly.\n\nLet me try another approach. The F1 is CcBb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB, cb, cB, or cb. Now, when F1 (CcBb) produces gametes, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes, and the F2 genotypes are formed by combining these gametes. Actually, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations. Let me list them:\n\n1. CB (from C and B) + CB (from C and B) \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb\n4. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n5. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n7. cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n8. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but this seems off. Actually, the correct method is to use a Punnett square where each F1 gamete combines with every other F1 gamete. So, the F2 will have:\n\n- Four combinations where both alleles are C (from CB + CB)\n- Two combinations where one allele is C and the other is c (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- One combination where both alleles are c (from cb + cb)\n- Two combinations where one allele is B and the other is b (from CB + cb and cb + cB)\n- One combination where both alleles are b (from cB + cB?)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct this. The F1 gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each can combine with any other gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- From CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- From CB + cB \u2192 CcBb\n- From CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- From cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- From cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n- From cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n- From cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n- From cB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- From cB + cb \u2192 ccBb\n- From cB + cB \u2192 ccBB\n- From cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n- From cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that each gene segregates independently, leading to 1/4 chance for each gamete. Thus, the F2 will have the following genotype distributions:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 0% (since B and b are recessive)\n- bb: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Each gene segregates into two possibilities, so the four phenotypes in terms of genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 0% (since B and b are recessive)\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut this leads to only five phenotypes, which contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the original idea that each gene segregates into two possible outcomes, and thus the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none of them say 1:1:1:1. They all vary differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of offspring in each phenotype group, considering dominance and blending. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele, it will express the corresponding color. So, let's see:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C present (red) \u2192 phenotype depends on B\n  - c present (plain) \u2192 phenotype depends on B\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B present (brown) \u2192 phenotype depends on C\n  - b present (checkered) \u2192 phenotype depends on C\n\nThus, each phenotype is a combination of these two traits. To find the expected phenotypic ratio, we can calculate how many offspring fall into each category.\n\nGiven the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. The F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four possible genotypic combinations (as previously listed), but each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet me count the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red-Brown (R-B)**: Occurs when C is present (regardless of B) and B is present (regardless of C). This includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, and Cc Bb.\n2. **Red-Checkered (R-b)**: Occurs when C is present (regardless of B) and B is absent (b). This includes CC bb and Cc bb.\n3. **Plain-Brown (r-B)**: Occurs when C is absent (c) and B is present (B). This includes cc BB and cc Bb.\n4. **Plain-Checkered (r-b)**: Occurs when C is absent (c) and B is absent (b). This includes cc bb.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each:\n\nAssuming each gamete combination is 25%, but the actual number depends on the number of offspring produced. However, without knowing the exact number of eggs and sperm, it's tricky, but often in these problems, we assume 100% efficiency and focus on the phenotypic ratios based on the genetic makeup.\n\nLet's calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- **Red-Brown**: Phenotype requires at least one dominant allele in both genes. So, the genotypes contributing to this are:\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n  So, 4 out of 16 (since each gamete combination leads to 16 possible offspring).\n  \n- **Red-Checkered**: Requires C dominant (so at least one C allele) and B recessive (no B alleles). Genotypes:\n  - CC bb\n  - Cc bb\n  So, 2 out of 16.\n\n- **Plain-Brown**: Requires C recessive (no C alleles) and B dominant (at least one B allele). Genotypes:\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n  So, 2 out of 16.\n\n- **Plain-Checkered**: Requires both C and B recessive. Genotype:\n  - cc bb\n  So, 1 out of 16.\n\nAdding up: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Red-Brown : Red-Checkered : Plain-Brown : Plain-Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which refers to plain-red) is 1, checkered brown (red-brown) is 4, plain red (Red-brown) is 4, and plain brown (red-checkered) is 2. Wait, no, perhaps my terminology is off.\n\nWait, the options mention \"checkered\" and \"plain\", so perhaps:\n\n- Checkered red: likely refers to plain red (cc RR), which is 1/16.\n- Checkered brown: red-brown (RR Rr, etc.) which is 4/16.\n- Plain red: red-plain (rr RR, etc.) which is 4/16?\nWait, no, confusion arises. Let me clarify the terms used in the options.\n\nIn the options:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:2:4, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red (plain-red) = 1 part\n- Checkered brown (red-brown) = 2 parts\n- Plain red (red-plain) = 2 parts\n- Plain brown (checkered-brown) = 4 parts\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9 parts, which doesn't align with any of the options. Option C states 9,3,3,1. That totals 16, which matches the 16 possible offspring. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the counts. Let's consider that each gene has two alleles, and for each gene, the presence of dominant allele increases the likelihood of expressing the trait. However, the exact number of offspring in each phenotype depends on the number of ways the alleles can combine.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that for each bird, the probability of having a particular phenotype is based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles. However, since the parents are homozygous and the genes are independent, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes, leading to 25% each. But the options don't include this ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds in each phenotype group after considering the number of gametes produced. Each bird can produce gametes in a certain ratio, and the total number of offspring would reflect the sum of these contributions.\n\nHowever, without knowing the number of eggs or sperm, it's challenging to provide an exact count. But typically, in genetics problems, unless specified otherwise, the ratio is considered based on the genetic makeup, ignoring the number of offspring. So, the ratio of the four phenotypes should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them reflect this exactly. Option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, totaling 16. That fits perfectly with a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is typical when dealing with multiple genes with two alleles each, as each gene doubles the number of phenotypes. However, in this case, we have two genes, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but if we consider the dominance hierarchy, perhaps it becomes 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering dominance in each gene separately. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it expresses that color. Otherwise, it remains checkered. In that case, the phenotypes would be combinations of dominant and non-dominant traits.\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (at least one dominant allele in each):\n   - C present (pigment red) AND B present (body brown) \u2192 red-brown (phenotype R-B)\n   - C present AND B absent \u2192 red-checkered (R-r)\n   - c absent AND B present \u2192 plain-brown (r-B)\n   - c absent AND B absent \u2192 plain-checkered (r-r)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype based on the F2 distribution:\n\nEach gene segregates into two outcomes, so each phenotype has a certain number of offspring.\n\n- R-B: All cases where at least one C and at least one B are present. This would be 13 out of 16 (since 3 out of 4 possibilities are not meeting both conditions).\n- R-r: Cases where C is present (so at least one C) and B is absent. This happens in 2 cases: CC bb and Cc bb.\n- r-B: Cases where C is absent (so cc) and B is present (BB or Bb). This also happens in 2 cases: cc BB and cc Bb.\n- r-r: Cases where both C and B are absent (cc and bb). Only 1 case: cc bb.\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 13:2:2:1. None of the options match this exactly. Option G mentions",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes.\n\nWait, but in reality, it's more accurate to consider that each gene contributes to one trait, and the presence of dominant alleles results in the trait being expressed. So for pigment color (C/B), the bird is either red (C present) or plain (c present). Similarly, for body color (B/b), it's either brown (B present) or checkered (b present). So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. So four phenotypes in total. However, some phenotypes may not be observed if certain alleles are absent. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 will have a mix of these phenotypes based on their genotype distribution.\n\nSo let's calculate the F2 phenotypic ratio. Each gene is segregating into two possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele), so combined, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypic classes. However, since the genes are independent, each class will occur with a probability equal to the product of the probabilities of each gene's segregation. Since both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1 will be heterozygous (CcBb), and the F2 will be the result of independent assortment for each gene, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypic classes. But let's verify that.\n\nFor the C locus: The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So for C:\n- CB: C (dominant)\n- cb: c (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for B locus: F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (both C's dominant)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, c recessive)\n- 25% cc (both recessive)\n- 25% bb\n\nBut now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: pigment red (since C is dominant) and B present (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc: pigment red (C dominant) and B absent (checkered) \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc: pigment plain (c) and B present (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n- bb: pigment plain (c) and B absent (checkered) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype do we expect? Since each gene segregates 50%, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across all four phenotypes. However, wait\u2014is that true? Because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are combinations. But since each trait is determined independently, the phenotypic ratios should indeed be 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me look at the options:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, etc. That suggests that the answer is probably based on the number of offspring in each category rather than a simple 1:1:1:1 ratio because the parents are homozygous and the cross might lead to different phenotypic counts due to dominance and blending.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself. Let's construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes:\n- From C locus: C (from CC) or c (from cc)\n- From B locus: B (from BB) or b (from bb)\n\nEach gamete combines one allele from each locus. So the gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Now, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C present), Body color brown (B present) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C present), Body color checkered (b present) \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc: Pigment plain (c present), Body color brown (B present) \u2192 plain-brown\n- bb: Pigment plain (c present), Body color checkered (b present) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype will there be? Since each gene segregates into two possible outcomes equally, the F2 should have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Instead, the options suggest that the phenotypic ratio is something else, like option D (1,3,9,3) or others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem isn't asking for a 1:1:1:1 ratio but instead expects us to consider the actual number of individuals in each phenotype group based on the possible gamete combinations, taking into account dominance and blending. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to count the number of each type of gamete and then determine the phenotypic ratio accordingly.\n\nLet me try another approach. The F1 is CcBb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB, cb, cB, or cb. Now, when F1 (CcBb) produces gametes, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes, and the F2 genotypes are formed by combining these gametes. Actually, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations. Let me list them:\n\n1. CB (from C and B) + CB (from C and B) \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb\n4. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n5. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n7. cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n8. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but this seems off. Actually, the correct method is to use a Punnett square where each F1 gamete combines with every other F1 gamete. So, the F2 will have:\n\n- Four combinations where both alleles are C (from CB + CB)\n- Two combinations where one allele is C and the other is c (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- One combination where both alleles are c (from cb + cb)\n- Two combinations where one allele is B and the other is b (from CB + cb and cb + cB)\n- One combination where both alleles are b (from cB + cB?)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct this. The F1 gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each can combine with any other gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- From CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- From CB + cB \u2192 CcBb\n- From CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- From cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- From cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n- From cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n- From cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n- From cB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- From cB + cb \u2192 ccBb\n- From cB + cB \u2192 ccBB\n- From cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n- From cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that each gene segregates independently, leading to 1/4 chance for each gamete. Thus, the F2 will have the following genotype distributions:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 0% (since B and b are recessive)\n- bb: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Each gene segregates into two possibilities, so the four phenotypes in terms of genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 0% (since B and b are recessive)\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut this leads to only five phenotypes, which contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the original idea that each gene segregates into two possible outcomes, and thus the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none of them say 1:1:1:1. They all vary differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of offspring in each phenotype group, considering dominance and blending. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele, it will express the corresponding color. So, let's see:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C present (red) \u2192 phenotype depends on B\n  - c present (plain) \u2192 phenotype depends on B\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B present (brown) \u2192 phenotype depends on C\n  - b present (checkered) \u2192 phenotype depends on C\n\nThus, each phenotype is a combination of these two traits. To find the expected phenotypic ratio, we can calculate how many offspring fall into each category.\n\nGiven the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. The F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four possible genotypic combinations (as previously listed), but each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet me count the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red-Brown (R-B)**: Occurs when C is present (regardless of B) and B is present (regardless of C). This includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, and Cc Bb.\n2. **Red-Checkered (R-b)**: Occurs when C is present (regardless of B) and B is absent (b). This includes CC bb and Cc bb.\n3. **Plain-Brown (r-B)**: Occurs when C is absent (c) and B is present (B). This includes cc BB and cc Bb.\n4. **Plain-Checkered (r-b)**: Occurs when C is absent (c) and B is absent (b). This includes cc bb.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each:\n\nAssuming each gamete combination is 25%, but the actual number depends on the number of offspring produced. However, without knowing the exact number of eggs and sperm, it's tricky, but often in these problems, we assume 100% efficiency and focus on the phenotypic ratios based on the genetic makeup.\n\nLet's calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- **Red-Brown**: Phenotype requires at least one dominant allele in both genes. So, the genotypes contributing to this are:\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n  So, 4 out of 16 (since each gamete combination leads to 16 possible offspring).\n  \n- **Red-Checkered**: Requires C dominant (so at least one C allele) and B recessive (no B alleles). Genotypes:\n  - CC bb\n  - Cc bb\n  So, 2 out of 16.\n\n- **Plain-Brown**: Requires C recessive (no C alleles) and B dominant (at least one B allele). Genotypes:\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n  So, 2 out of 16.\n\n- **Plain-Checkered**: Requires both C and B recessive. Genotype:\n  - cc bb\n  So, 1 out of 16.\n\nAdding up: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Red-Brown : Red-Checkered : Plain-Brown : Plain-Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which refers to plain-red) is 1, checkered brown (red-brown) is 4, plain red (Red-brown) is 4, and plain brown (red-checkered) is 2. Wait, no, perhaps my terminology is off.\n\nWait, the options mention \"checkered\" and \"plain\", so perhaps:\n\n- Checkered red: likely refers to plain red (cc RR), which is 1/16.\n- Checkered brown: red-brown (RR Rr, etc.) which is 4/16.\n- Plain red: red-plain (rr RR, etc.) which is 4/16?\nWait, no, confusion arises. Let me clarify the terms used in the options.\n\nIn the options:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:2:4, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red (plain-red) = 1 part\n- Checkered brown (red-brown) = 2 parts\n- Plain red (red-plain) = 2 parts\n- Plain brown (checkered-brown) = 4 parts\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9 parts, which doesn't align with any of the options. Option C states 9,3,3,1. That totals 16, which matches the 16 possible offspring. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the counts. Let's consider that each gene has two alleles, and for each gene, the presence of dominant allele increases the likelihood of expressing the trait. However, the exact number of offspring in each phenotype depends on the number of ways the alleles can combine.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that for each bird, the probability of having a particular phenotype is based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles. However, since the parents are homozygous and the genes are independent, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes, leading to 25% each. But the options don't include this ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds in each phenotype group after considering the number of gametes produced. Each bird can produce gametes in a certain ratio, and the total number of offspring would reflect the sum of these contributions.\n\nHowever, without knowing the number of eggs or sperm, it's challenging to provide an exact count. But typically, in genetics problems, unless specified otherwise, the ratio is considered based on the genetic makeup, ignoring the number of offspring. So, the ratio of the four phenotypes should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them reflect this exactly. Option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, totaling 16. That fits perfectly with a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is typical when dealing with multiple genes with two alleles each, as each gene doubles the number of phenotypes. However, in this case, we have two genes, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but if we consider the dominance hierarchy, perhaps it becomes 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering dominance in each gene separately. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it expresses that color. Otherwise, it remains checkered. In that case, the phenotypes would be combinations of dominant and non-dominant traits.\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (at least one dominant allele in each):\n   - C present (pigment red) AND B present (body brown) \u2192 red-brown (phenotype R-B)\n   - C present AND B absent \u2192 red-checkered (R-r)\n   - c absent AND B present \u2192 plain-brown (r-B)\n   - c absent AND B absent \u2192 plain-checkered (r-r)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype based on the F2 distribution:\n\nEach gene segregates into two outcomes, so each phenotype has a certain number of offspring.\n\n- R-B: All cases where at least one C and at least one B are present. This would be 13 out of 16 (since 3 out of 4 possibilities are not meeting both conditions).\n- R-r: Cases where C is present (so at least one C) and B is absent. This happens in 2 cases: CC bb and Cc bb.\n- r-B: Cases where C is absent (so cc) and B is present (BB or Bb). This also happens in 2 cases: cc BB and cc Bb.\n- r-r: Cases where both C and B are absent (cc and bb). Only 1 case: cc bb.\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 13:2:2:1. None of the options match this exactly. Option G mentions",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for pigment color, red (C) or plain (c); for body color, brown (B) or checkered (b).",
    "rollout": " So for pigment color, red (C) or plain (c); for body color, brown (B) or checkered (b). Thus, four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will show different numbers of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios. To calculate the number of each phenotype, we'll look at the proportion of each genotype in the F2.\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian ratio. Since the parents are Cc and Bb, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined ratios are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into phenotypes. Alternatively, we can compute the probability for each phenotype by looking at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count how many of each phenotype:\n\nRed Brown: Cases 1, 4, 5 \u2192 3 cases\nRed Checkered: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\nPlain Brown: Cases 3, 6, 7 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain Checkered: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3 : 1 : 3 : 2, adding up to 9 parts.\n\nBut wait, according to our earlier calculation, the counts were approximately 3/9, 1/9, 3/9, 2/9. That matches. Now, translating this into a ratio: 3:1:3:2.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Wait, but our count was 3:1:3:2. If we scale up by factor 3, checkered red becomes 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match any option directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual counts without scaling. According to my previous analysis, the counts are 3 red brown, 1 red checkered, 3 plain brown, and 2 plain checkered. Total of 9 birds.\n\nIf the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, then it would be 3:1:3:2. But none of the options seem to exactly match this. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\nL.3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E\n\nWait, none of them have the exact 3:1:3:2 ratio. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check. The genotypic ratios for each gene are 25%, 50%, 25% for C and B respectively. The combined phenotypic ratios would indeed lead to 3:1:3:2. So perhaps the options are presented differently. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16. Our calculation shows 3:1:3:2, which could also be represented as 9:3:9:6 if scaled by 3, but that's not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the fact that some phenotypes might not occur due to being homozygous. Wait, but the F2 includes all possible genotypes, including homozygotes like cc bb. So the phenotypic ratios include all four possibilities.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Our calculation suggests 3:1:3:2, which scales to 9:3:9:6. None of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown \u2013 3 individuals\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered \u2013 1\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown \u2013 3\nPhenotype 4: Plain Checkered \u2013 2\n\nTotal: 3+1+3+2=9\n\nSo 3:1:3:2. This can be written as 9:3:9:6 if scaled by 3, but none of the options do that. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the non-homogamous phenotypes, excluding the homozygous ones. In that case:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 2\n\nSum: 9. So 3:1:3:2, same as before. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum 16. Doesn't align.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. Again, 1:3:9:3. Hmm, that looks like a ratio where the checkered red is the least, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine. The checkered color is determined by the recessive allele 'c', and the brown color by 'B'. Pigment color is determined by 'C' (dominant, red), while body color is determined by 'B' (dominant, brown). So the order of dominance is: C > B, meaning if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will display red pigment regardless of the body color (since B is dominant, but red is expressed even if brown is present).\n\nWait, but no\u2014that's not quite right. The expression depends on both genes. For pigment color, C is dominant over c. For body color, B is dominant over b. So, a bird with C and B (C_B_) will have red pigment and brown body. A bird with C and b (C_bb) will have red pigment and plain body. Similarly, a bird with c and B (cbB) will have plain pigment and brown body. Finally, a bird with c and b (cbb) will have plain pigment and plain body.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- C_B_: Red Brown\n- C_bb: Red Plain\n- cbB: Plain Brown\n- cbb: Plain Plain\n\nThe counts are as follows:\n\nFrom F2:\n\n- C_B_: 3/9 = 1/3 of total\n- C_bb: 3/9 = 1/3\n- cbB: 3/9 = 1/3\n- cbb: 2/9\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 3:1:3:2, but now I see that the correct breakdown is:\n\nRed Brown: 3 cases\nRed Plain: 3 cases\nPlain Brown: 3 cases\nPlain Plain: 2 cases\n\nWhich adds up to 9 cases.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 3:3:3:2, which simplifies to 3:1:1:0.666... But since ratios are integers, we can express it as 9:9:9:6 when scaled up by 3. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 total. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16 total. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total. 1:3:9:3, which seems to follow a geometric progression, suggesting a 3:1:3:1 ratio, but our count is 3:3:3:2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the non-homogamous phenotypes. If so, checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (2). Sum 11. Not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the non-homogamous red birds, i.e., those with C and B. Those would be 3, plus the checkered brown (1), and plain red (3). So 3:1:3. But none of the options match that either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach. Using the Punnett square, the possible genotypic ratios are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red Brown (R_B)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered (R_b)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (p_B)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown (R_B)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown (R_B)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (p_b)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (p_B)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (p_b)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (p_b)\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- R_B: 25% CC BB + 25% CC Bb + 25% Cc BB = 75%\n- R_b: 50% CC Bb\n- p_B: 25% CC bb + 25% Cc BB + 25% Cc Bb = 75% of R_B?\nWait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nActually, each percentage corresponds to a specific phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 R_B: 25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 R_b: 50%\n- CC bb \u2192 p_B: 25%\n- Cc BB \u2192 R_B: 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 R_B: 25%\n- Cc bb \u2192 p_b: 25%\n- cc BB \u2192 p_B: 25%\n- cc Bb \u2192 p_b: 25%\n- cc bb \u2192 p_b: 25%\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | R_B\nCC Bb | R_b\nCC bb | p_B\nCc BB | R_B\nCc Bb | R_B\nCc bb | p_b\ncc BB | p_B\ncc Bb | p_b\ncc bb | p_b\n\nNow, percentages:\n\n- R_B: CC BB (25%) + CC Bb (50%) + Cc BB (25%) = 100%? Wait no\u2014wait, each percentage represents the proportion of each genotype. So:\n\n- R_B: CC BB (25%), CC Bb (50%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 total 100% \u2192 All R_B.\nWait, that's impossible because each percentage adds up to 100%. Wait, no\u2014if CC BB is 25%, CC Bb 50%, and Cc BB 25%, that totals 100%, so R_B is 100%, which isn't possible because some other phenotypes must exist. Wait, that's clearly wrong. I must have miscounted.\n\nAh, no\u2014I messed up the breakdown. Let me clarify:\n\nEach of the nine genotypes contributes to the next generation. The phenotypes are determined by the combination of C/B and b/b.\n\nBut the correct way is:\n\n- R_B (Red Brown): Any bird with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. So CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 75% of the population.\n- R_b (Red Checkered): Only CC Bb \u2192 50%.\n- p_B (Plain Brown): Any bird with at least one recessive b (i.e., not R_B) \u2192 These are CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because some of these would fall under p_B.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. The correct way is to realize that the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- R_B: 75% (all except those with p_B)\n- R_b: 25% (only those with CC Bb)\n- p_B: 25% (all except those with R_B)\n- p_b: 25% (all except those with R_B and p_B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me use the Punnett square approach.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes based on their genotypes:\n\n1. R_B: 3 cases (RR_B_, RR_bb, r_r_B_)\n2. R_b: 1 case (RR_bb)\n3. p_B: 3 cases (rr_R_, rr_bb, r_r_B_)\n4. p_b: 2 cases (rr_rr)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:1:3:2.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:2.\n\nLooking at the options again, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Our correct ratio is 3:1:3:2, which adds to 9 parts. Scaling up by 3, we'd get 9:3:9:6. But none of the options match exactly.\n\nWait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16. It doesn't match our 3:1:3:2.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. It's 1:3:9:3, which doesn't align with our 3:1:3:2.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12. Not matching.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color, red (C) or plain (c); for body color, brown (B) or checkered (b). Thus, four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will show different numbers of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios. To calculate the number of each phenotype, we'll look at the proportion of each genotype in the F2.\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian ratio. Since the parents are Cc and Bb, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined ratios are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into phenotypes. Alternatively, we can compute the probability for each phenotype by looking at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, count how many of each phenotype:\n\nRed Brown: Cases 1, 4, 5 \u2192 3 cases\nRed Checkered: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\nPlain Brown: Cases 3, 6, 7 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain Checkered: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3 : 1 : 3 : 2, adding up to 9 parts.\n\nBut wait, according to our earlier calculation, the counts were approximately 3/9, 1/9, 3/9, 2/9. That matches. Now, translating this into a ratio: 3:1:3:2.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Wait, but our count was 3:1:3:2. If we scale up by factor 3, checkered red becomes 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match any option directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual counts without scaling. According to my previous analysis, the counts are 3 red brown, 1 red checkered, 3 plain brown, and 2 plain checkered. Total of 9 birds.\n\nIf the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, then it would be 3:1:3:2. But none of the options seem to exactly match this. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\nL.3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E\n\nWait, none of them have the exact 3:1:3:2 ratio. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check. The genotypic ratios for each gene are 25%, 50%, 25% for C and B respectively. The combined phenotypic ratios would indeed lead to 3:1:3:2. So perhaps the options are presented differently. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16. Our calculation shows 3:1:3:2, which could also be represented as 9:3:9:6 if scaled by 3, but that's not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the fact that some phenotypes might not occur due to being homozygous. Wait, but the F2 includes all possible genotypes, including homozygotes like cc bb. So the phenotypic ratios include all four possibilities.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Our calculation suggests 3:1:3:2, which scales to 9:3:9:6. None of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown \u2013 3 individuals\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered \u2013 1\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown \u2013 3\nPhenotype 4: Plain Checkered \u2013 2\n\nTotal: 3+1+3+2=9\n\nSo 3:1:3:2. This can be written as 9:3:9:6 if scaled by 3, but none of the options do that. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the non-homogamous phenotypes, excluding the homozygous ones. In that case:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 2\n\nSum: 9. So 3:1:3:2, same as before. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum 16. Doesn't align.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. Again, 1:3:9:3. Hmm, that looks like a ratio where the checkered red is the least, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine. The checkered color is determined by the recessive allele 'c', and the brown color by 'B'. Pigment color is determined by 'C' (dominant, red), while body color is determined by 'B' (dominant, brown). So the order of dominance is: C > B, meaning if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will display red pigment regardless of the body color (since B is dominant, but red is expressed even if brown is present).\n\nWait, but no\u2014that's not quite right. The expression depends on both genes. For pigment color, C is dominant over c. For body color, B is dominant over b. So, a bird with C and B (C_B_) will have red pigment and brown body. A bird with C and b (C_bb) will have red pigment and plain body. Similarly, a bird with c and B (cbB) will have plain pigment and brown body. Finally, a bird with c and b (cbb) will have plain pigment and plain body.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- C_B_: Red Brown\n- C_bb: Red Plain\n- cbB: Plain Brown\n- cbb: Plain Plain\n\nThe counts are as follows:\n\nFrom F2:\n\n- C_B_: 3/9 = 1/3 of total\n- C_bb: 3/9 = 1/3\n- cbB: 3/9 = 1/3\n- cbb: 2/9\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 3:1:3:2, but now I see that the correct breakdown is:\n\nRed Brown: 3 cases\nRed Plain: 3 cases\nPlain Brown: 3 cases\nPlain Plain: 2 cases\n\nWhich adds up to 9 cases.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 3:3:3:2, which simplifies to 3:1:1:0.666... But since ratios are integers, we can express it as 9:9:9:6 when scaled up by 3. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 total. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16 total. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total. 1:3:9:3, which seems to follow a geometric progression, suggesting a 3:1:3:1 ratio, but our count is 3:3:3:2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the non-homogamous phenotypes. If so, checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (2). Sum 11. Not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the non-homogamous red birds, i.e., those with C and B. Those would be 3, plus the checkered brown (1), and plain red (3). So 3:1:3. But none of the options match that either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach. Using the Punnett square, the possible genotypic ratios are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red Brown (R_B)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered (R_b)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (p_B)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown (R_B)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown (R_B)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (p_b)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (p_B)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (p_b)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (p_b)\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- R_B: 25% CC BB + 25% CC Bb + 25% Cc BB = 75%\n- R_b: 50% CC Bb\n- p_B: 25% CC bb + 25% Cc BB + 25% Cc Bb = 75% of R_B?\nWait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nActually, each percentage corresponds to a specific phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 R_B: 25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 R_b: 50%\n- CC bb \u2192 p_B: 25%\n- Cc BB \u2192 R_B: 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 R_B: 25%\n- Cc bb \u2192 p_b: 25%\n- cc BB \u2192 p_B: 25%\n- cc Bb \u2192 p_b: 25%\n- cc bb \u2192 p_b: 25%\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | R_B\nCC Bb | R_b\nCC bb | p_B\nCc BB | R_B\nCc Bb | R_B\nCc bb | p_b\ncc BB | p_B\ncc Bb | p_b\ncc bb | p_b\n\nNow, percentages:\n\n- R_B: CC BB (25%) + CC Bb (50%) + Cc BB (25%) = 100%? Wait no\u2014wait, each percentage represents the proportion of each genotype. So:\n\n- R_B: CC BB (25%), CC Bb (50%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 total 100% \u2192 All R_B.\nWait, that's impossible because each percentage adds up to 100%. Wait, no\u2014if CC BB is 25%, CC Bb 50%, and Cc BB 25%, that totals 100%, so R_B is 100%, which isn't possible because some other phenotypes must exist. Wait, that's clearly wrong. I must have miscounted.\n\nAh, no\u2014I messed up the breakdown. Let me clarify:\n\nEach of the nine genotypes contributes to the next generation. The phenotypes are determined by the combination of C/B and b/b.\n\nBut the correct way is:\n\n- R_B (Red Brown): Any bird with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. So CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 75% of the population.\n- R_b (Red Checkered): Only CC Bb \u2192 50%.\n- p_B (Plain Brown): Any bird with at least one recessive b (i.e., not R_B) \u2192 These are CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because some of these would fall under p_B.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. The correct way is to realize that the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- R_B: 75% (all except those with p_B)\n- R_b: 25% (only those with CC Bb)\n- p_B: 25% (all except those with R_B)\n- p_b: 25% (all except those with R_B and p_B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me use the Punnett square approach.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes based on their genotypes:\n\n1. R_B: 3 cases (RR_B_, RR_bb, r_r_B_)\n2. R_b: 1 case (RR_bb)\n3. p_B: 3 cases (rr_R_, rr_bb, r_r_B_)\n4. p_b: 2 cases (rr_rr)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:1:3:2.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:2.\n\nLooking at the options again, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Our correct ratio is 3:1:3:2, which adds to 9 parts. Scaling up by 3, we'd get 9:3:9:6. But none of the options match exactly.\n\nWait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16. It doesn't match our 3:1:3:2.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. It's 1:3:9:3, which doesn't align with our 3:1:3:2.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12. Not matching.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nOption L: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as G.\n\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as I.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16. This matches our 9:3:9:6 when scaled by 3, but still not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nAssuming the F2 genotypic ratio is 25% CC BB, 50% CC Bb, 25% CC bb, 25% Cc BB, 50% Cc Bb, 25% Cc bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb, 25% cc bb.\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 R_B (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb \u2192 R_b (Red Checkered)\n- CC bb \u2192 p_B (Plain Brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 R_B\n- Cc Bb \u2192 R_B\n- Cc bb \u2192 p_b\n- cc BB \u2192 p_B\n- cc Bb \u2192 p_b\n- cc bb \u2192 p_b\n\nSo the counts are:\n\nR_B: CC BB (25%), CC Bb (50%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 total 100%\nR_b: CC Bb (50%) \u2192 50%\np_B: CC bb (25%) + Cc Bb (25%) + cc BB (25%) + cc Bb (25%) \u2192 100%\np_b: Cc bb (25%) + cc bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n\nWait, that can't be.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Pigment Red, Body Brown \u2192 RrBb (but wait, the letters are uppercase for presence, so it's actually RR for pigment, BB for body. So, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1.

    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene is acting independently, the phenotypic ratios would be the product of the individual ratios.",
    "rollout": " Since each gene is acting independently, the phenotypic ratios would be the product of the individual ratios.\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s not exactly that. Each gene contributes to one trait. So for pigment color, the presence (C) is red, absence (c) is plain. For body color, presence (B) is brown, absence (b) is checkered. Since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering all combinations of these traits. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red brown (checkered bird?)\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states that the dominant allele C controls pigment color, making the bird red. The recessive allele c makes it plain. Similarly, B controls brown, and b makes it checkered. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: red brown (but checkered is when both are recessive, i.e., c and b)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the phenotype is determined by the alleles present. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it is red.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it is brown.\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these. But the checkered color refers to the body color when both genes are recessive. Wait, the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So regardless of the pigment color, if it's plain (c), then it's plain. Similarly, brown is determined by the presence of B. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of C/B status.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent)\n\nBut wait, in reality, if a bird is red (C is present) and has brown body (B is present), it would be red brown. If it's red and checkered (B absent), it's red checkered. Similarly, plain (no C) and brown (B present) is plain brown, and plain and checkered is plain checkered.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. So let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic categories if dominance applies, but in this case, dominance leads to one phenotype. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and whether B is present. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 red checkered\n3. Not C and B \u2192 plain brown\n4. Not C and not B \u2192 plain checkered\n\nTo determine the frequency of each phenotype, we'll consider the probability of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present:\n   - P(C) = 3/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: red brown\n\n2. C present, B absent:\n   - P(C) = 3/4\n   - P(b) = 1/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: red checkered\n\n3. C absent, B present:\n   - P(c) = 1/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: plain brown\n\n4. Both C and B absent:\n   - P(c) = 1/4\n   - P(b) = 1/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: plain checkered\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts, assuming a large population where the ratios hold approximately:\n\n- red brown: 9/16\n- red checkered: 3/16\n- plain brown: 3/16\n- plain checkered: 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16 parts: 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches our calculation\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, doesn't fit\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\nK.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene is acting independently, the phenotypic ratios would be the product of the individual ratios.\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s not exactly that. Each gene contributes to one trait. So for pigment color, the presence (C) is red, absence (c) is plain. For body color, presence (B) is brown, absence (b) is checkered. Since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering all combinations of these traits. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red brown (checkered bird?)\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states that the dominant allele C controls pigment color, making the bird red. The recessive allele c makes it plain. Similarly, B controls brown, and b makes it checkered. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: red brown (but checkered is when both are recessive, i.e., c and b)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the phenotype is determined by the alleles present. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it is red.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it is brown.\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these. But the checkered color refers to the body color when both genes are recessive. Wait, the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So regardless of the pigment color, if it's plain (c), then it's plain. Similarly, brown is determined by the presence of B. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of C/B status.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent)\n\nBut wait, in reality, if a bird is red (C is present) and has brown body (B is present), it would be red brown. If it's red and checkered (B absent), it's red checkered. Similarly, plain (no C) and brown (B present) is plain brown, and plain and checkered is plain checkered.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. So let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic categories if dominance applies, but in this case, dominance leads to one phenotype. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and whether B is present. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 red checkered\n3. Not C and B \u2192 plain brown\n4. Not C and not B \u2192 plain checkered\n\nTo determine the frequency of each phenotype, we'll consider the probability of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present:\n   - P(C) = 3/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: red brown\n\n2. C present, B absent:\n   - P(C) = 3/4\n   - P(b) = 1/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: red checkered\n\n3. C absent, B present:\n   - P(c) = 1/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: plain brown\n\n4. Both C and B absent:\n   - P(c) = 1/4\n   - P(b) = 1/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: plain checkered\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts, assuming a large population where the ratios hold approximately:\n\n- red brown: 9/16\n- red checkered: 3/16\n- plain brown: 3/16\n- plain checkered: 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16 parts: 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches our calculation\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, doesn't fit\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\nK. Wait, none of the options seem to directly correspond except option K, which isn't listed. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's double-check the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Let me confirm:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- C (present) \u2192 red\n- B (present) \u2192 brown\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the presence of C and B.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are indeed as I calculated before: 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nLooking at the answer options, option C matches 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 red brown, 3 red checkered, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo the four phenotypic categories are as above. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of both genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 would combine the alleles from the parents.\n\nFor the C locus (C is dominant over c):\n- In F1 (CcBb), the gametes are CB and cb.\n- So, for each F1, there's a 50% chance of contributing C or c.\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so for each gene, the F1 can produce gametes with either C or c, each at 50% probability. Similarly, for the B locus (B is dominant over b), F1 is Bb, so gametes are B or b, each at 50%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are determined by the independent assortment of these genes. For each gene, the possible outcomes are C (for pigment) or c (plain), and B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_B_)**\n   - This requires C (from C) and B (from B).\n   - Probability = (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n   \n2. **Plain red (c_B_)**\n   - Requires c (from c) and B (from B).\n   - Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n   \n3. **Checkered brown (C_bb)**\n   - Requires C (from C) and b (from b).\n   - Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n   \n4. **Plain brown (c_bb)**\n   - Requires c (from c) and b (from b).\n   - Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nBut wait, this doesn't account for dominance properly. Wait, no\u2014the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is segregating into two alleles, and each allele's presence affects the phenotype, the probabilities should add up correctly. So, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none directly say a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of surviving offspring rather than phenotypic ratios. Wait, but the question specifically asks for phenotypic ratios. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the segregation. Wait, each gene segregates independently, so the overall F2 would indeed have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 no, that doesn't match. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2014 also different. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are counted. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of the order.\n\nLet me try another approach. Considering that each F2 bird's genotype determines its phenotype:\n\n- C_B_: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- c_B_: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- C_bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c_bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nIf we sum these, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none of them state 1:1:1:1. Instead, all options seem to have some variation where one phenotype is absent. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the number of birds with certain phenotypes, not the proportion. Let me see:\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes. Assuming all F2 birds survive, the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 12 birds, but without knowing the total population, it's hard to determine the exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio within a specific context, like considering survival rates.\n\nWait, the problem statement might imply that not all offspring survive, especially those with certain coat colors. But the question does mention \"phenotypic ratio,\" implying the ratio of surviving individuals. However, without knowing the survival rate, it's impossible to calculate the actual ratio. So perhaps the intended approach is to assume that all F2 birds survive, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect that exactly. \n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16 birds, with 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 1 plain brown, 3 plain red. Doesn't fit 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16. Again, not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is being interpreted differently. Let me consider that each bird may display multiple traits, but the question seems to focus on each phenotype individually. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype relative to others, ignoring the fourth category.\n\nWait, another angle: Perhaps the problem assumes that the checkered bird (cc BB) is the most common phenotype, while the plain bird (cc bb) is rare. But according to our earlier analysis, all four phenotypes occur equally often in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with dominant versus recessive traits, but given that each bird can have multiple traits, it's unclear.\n\nGiven that none of the options perfectly align with a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. How?\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities, possibly including dominance. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are working, then each bird's phenotype is determined by both alleles, so the probabilities remain 25% each for the four phenotypes. Unless the question is counting the number of birds with at least one dominant trait, but that's not what the question states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of pigment, ignoring the body color. If that were the case, then:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 Checkered red (if B is brown) or plain red (if b is brown)\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 Checkered brown (if B is brown) or plain brown (if b is brown)\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red: Checkered red (B present) : plain red (b present) \u2192 2:1\n- Pigment plain: Checkered brown (B present) : plain brown (b present) \u2192 2:1\n\nBut since the question specifies both traits, it's unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer considers only the pigment color, making the phenotypic ratio 6:2:6:2 (option A), but the question mentions both traits, so that might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation was done incorrectly, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not among the options, I must reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation. Let me redo the Punnett square.\n\nParental cross is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb. Each parent produces gametes:\n\n- CcBb can produce CB or cb\n- ccbb can produce cb only\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal numbers. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs:\n\n- Each gamete CB can combine with CB, resulting in CC BB (probability 25%), CB combined with cb results in Cc Bb (but wait, no\u2014each gamete is either CB or cb, so combining CB and cb gives Cc (for the C locus) and Bb (for the B locus). Wait, no\u2014wait, the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB or cb gametes. So when F1 \u00d7 F1, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc Bb (another 25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because each F1 produces two types of gametes, CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) s, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut now, considering dominance, each of these gametes leads to the following phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, body brown (since B is dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red, plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (1/4)\n- Pigment red & brown: 50% (1/2)\n- Plain red & brown: 25% (1/4)\n\nBut again, the options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps the original assumption is wrong, and the question expects us to count the number of birds with each phenotype, not the proportion. Let's see the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total of 16 birds. If 9 have checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 1 plain brown, 3 plain red, adding up to 16. That could mean that the F2 generation includes 16 birds, with the distribution as above. But why 9 instead of 4? It's possible that the parents' gametes are not as assumed.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the gametes was incorrect. Let me double-check. The F1 from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb would indeed produce CB and cb gametes in equal amounts, right? So each parent's gametes would be 50% CB and 50% cb. Thus, the F2 would have a 25% chance of each genotype: CC BB, Cc Bb, cc bb. Then, converting to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, brown (so both traits expressed)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red, plain brown\n\nEach phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so in a group of 16, we'd expect 4 of each. But option E suggests 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 1 plain brown, 3 plain red. That adds up to 16, but with a higher count for checkered brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that only the presence of pigment matters, not the body color. If so, then:\n\n- Pigment red: Checkered red (B present) : Plain red (b present) \u2192 2:1\n- Pigment plain: Checkered brown (B present) : Plain brown (b present) \u2192 2:1\n\nBut the question combines both traits, so that reasoning isn't applicable.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the question is considering only the pigment color, ignoring the body color. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 6:2:6:2 (option A), but the question mentions both traits, so that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the dominance and consider all possible combinations. Wait, but in reality, dominance changes the phenotypic ratio.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. How would that happen?\n\nWait, if each F2 bird has a 1/4 chance of each phenotype, and if we're considering all four phenotypes, the total would be 4 parts. However, option D suggests 1,3,9,3, totaling 16 birds. That implies that the F2 generation has 16 birds, with 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo the four phenotypic categories are as above. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of both genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 would combine the alleles from the parents.\n\nFor the C locus (C is dominant over c):\n- In F1 (CcBb), the gametes are CB and cb.\n- So, for each F1, there's a 50% chance of contributing C or c.\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so for each gene, the F1 can produce gametes with either C or c, each at 50% probability. Similarly, for the B locus (B is dominant over b), F1 is Bb, so gametes are B or b, each at 50%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are determined by the independent assortment of these genes. For each gene, the possible outcomes are C (for pigment) or c (plain), and B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_B_)**\n   - This requires C (from C) and B (from B).\n   - Probability = (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n   \n2. **Plain red (c_B_)**\n   - Requires c (from c) and B (from B).\n   - Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n   \n3. **Checkered brown (C_bb)**\n   - Requires C (from C) and b (from b).\n   - Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n   \n4. **Plain brown (c_bb)**\n   - Requires c (from c) and b (from b).\n   - Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nBut wait, this doesn't account for dominance properly. Wait, no\u2014the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is segregating into two alleles, and each allele's presence affects the phenotype, the probabilities should add up correctly. So, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none directly say a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of surviving offspring rather than phenotypic ratios. Wait, but the question specifically asks for phenotypic ratios. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the segregation. Wait, each gene segregates independently, so the overall F2 would indeed have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 no, that doesn't match. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2014 also different. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are counted. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of the order.\n\nLet me try another approach. Considering that each F2 bird's genotype determines its phenotype:\n\n- C_B_: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- c_B_: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- C_bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c_bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nIf we sum these, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none of them state 1:1:1:1. Instead, all options seem to have some variation where one phenotype is absent. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the number of birds with certain phenotypes, not the proportion. Let me see:\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes. Assuming all F2 birds survive, the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 12 birds, but without knowing the total population, it's hard to determine the exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio within a specific context, like considering survival rates.\n\nWait, the problem statement might imply that not all offspring survive, especially those with certain coat colors. But the question does mention \"phenotypic ratio,\" implying the ratio of surviving individuals. However, without knowing the survival rate, it's impossible to calculate the actual ratio. So perhaps the intended approach is to assume that all F2 birds survive, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect that exactly. \n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16 birds, with 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 1 plain brown, 3 plain red. Doesn't fit 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16. Again, not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is being interpreted differently. Let me consider that each bird may display multiple traits, but the question seems to focus on each phenotype individually. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype relative to others, ignoring the fourth category.\n\nWait, another angle: Perhaps the problem assumes that the checkered bird (cc BB) is the most common phenotype, while the plain bird (cc bb) is rare. But according to our earlier analysis, all four phenotypes occur equally often in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with dominant versus recessive traits, but given that each bird can have multiple traits, it's unclear.\n\nGiven that none of the options perfectly align with a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. How?\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities, possibly including dominance. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are working, then each bird's phenotype is determined by both alleles, so the probabilities remain 25% each for the four phenotypes. Unless the question is counting the number of birds with at least one dominant trait, but that's not what the question states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of pigment, ignoring the body color. If that were the case, then:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 Checkered red (if B is brown) or plain red (if b is brown)\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 Checkered brown (if B is brown) or plain brown (if b is brown)\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red: Checkered red (B present) : plain red (b present) \u2192 2:1\n- Pigment plain: Checkered brown (B present) : plain brown (b present) \u2192 2:1\n\nBut since the question specifies both traits, it's unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer considers only the pigment color, making the phenotypic ratio 6:2:6:2 (option A), but the question mentions both traits, so that might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation was done incorrectly, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not among the options, I must reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation. Let me redo the Punnett square.\n\nParental cross is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb. Each parent produces gametes:\n\n- CcBb can produce CB or cb\n- ccbb can produce cb only\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal numbers. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs:\n\n- Each gamete CB can combine with CB, resulting in CC BB (probability 25%), CB combined with cb results in Cc Bb (but wait, no\u2014each gamete is either CB or cb, so combining CB and cb gives Cc (for the C locus) and Bb (for the B locus). Wait, no\u2014wait, the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB or cb gametes. So when F1 \u00d7 F1, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc Bb (another 25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because each F1 produces two types of gametes, CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) s, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut now, considering dominance, each of these gametes leads to the following phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, body brown (since B is dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red, plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (1/4)\n- Pigment red & brown: 50% (1/2)\n- Plain red & brown: 25% (1/4)\n\nBut again, the options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps the original assumption is wrong, and the question expects us to count the number of birds with each phenotype, not the proportion. Let's see the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total of 16 birds. If 9 have checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 1 plain brown, 3 plain red, adding up to 16. That could mean that the F2 generation includes 16 birds, with the distribution as above. But why 9 instead of 4? It's possible that the parents' gametes are not as assumed.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the gametes was incorrect. Let me double-check. The F1 from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb would indeed produce CB and cb gametes in equal amounts, right? So each parent's gametes would be 50% CB and 50% cb. Thus, the F2 would have a 25% chance of each genotype: CC BB, Cc Bb, cc bb. Then, converting to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, brown (so both traits expressed)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red, plain brown\n\nEach phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so in a group of 16, we'd expect 4 of each. But option E suggests 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 1 plain brown, 3 plain red. That adds up to 16, but with a higher count for checkered brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that only the presence of pigment matters, not the body color. If so, then:\n\n- Pigment red: Checkered red (B present) : Plain red (b present) \u2192 2:1\n- Pigment plain: Checkered brown (B present) : Plain brown (b present) \u2192 2:1\n\nBut the question combines both traits, so that reasoning isn't applicable.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the question is considering only the pigment color, ignoring the body color. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 6:2:6:2 (option A), but the question mentions both traits, so that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the dominance and consider all possible combinations. Wait, but in reality, dominance changes the phenotypic ratio.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. How would that happen?\n\nWait, if each F2 bird has a 1/4 chance of each phenotype, and if we're considering all four phenotypes, the total would be 4 parts. However, option D suggests 1,3,9,3, totaling 16 birds. That implies that the F2 generation has 16 birds, with 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. But under Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype should have 4 birds (assuming 16), unless there's a selection against certain phenotypes.\n\nBut the question doesn't mention any selection, so that shouldn't be the case. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the F2 generation has a 1:1:1:1 ratio, and thus the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to count the number of birds with at least one dominant trait, but that interpretation is unclear.\n\nGiven that none of the options perfectly match the 1:1:1:1 ratio, and considering the options provided, I think the closest plausible answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This comes from the idea that the F2 generation has 16 birds, with 1 each of the four phenotypes, but scaled up to 16 birds. However, without further clarification, I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that doesn't make sense because both traits should influence the phenotype.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the distribution of the phenotypes across the F2 generation.",
    "rollout": " So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the distribution of the phenotypes across the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Since each bird has two genes, each determining one trait, the number of possible phenotypes depends on how the dominance works. Since the traits are separate, each bird can express any of the four combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify. Each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Checkered red\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Plain red\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Checkered brown\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Plain brown\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Plain pigment (c) and Brown color (B): Checkered brown\n- Plain pigment (c) and Brown color (B): Plain brown\n\nAnd same for blue and green, but in this case, we don't have another gene. Wait, no\u2014the problem states two genes: pigment (C and c) and color (B and b). So each bird has two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes based on the combination of the two traits. But the options given suggest that some phenotypes may not occur due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this case, the dominance is straightforward: dominant alleles are expressed, recessive are not. So, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C_B) | C_B | 25%\nPlain red (c_B) | c_B | 25%\nCheckered brown (C_b) | C_b | 25%\nPlain brown (c_b) | c_b | 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 25% each for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A-G include various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Perhaps the actual phenotypes aren't equally likely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of the recessive allele leads to different phenotypes. Wait, but according to standard Mendelian genetics, each phenotype is expressed based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles, regardless of the order. So the phenotypes are equally likely in a dihybrid cross where both genes are segregating independently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation considering the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are fully dominant, then the phenotypes would follow the sum of the probabilities squared. Wait, but in reality, each gene is independent, so the total phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% each. But none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check them again:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which doesn't add up to 16. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 16.\n\nHmm, so all options except A and B sum to 16. Option A sums to 6+2+6+2=16, and option B sums to 8+4+0+4=16. So why do I think the answer is different?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the problem is considering that some phenotypes cannot coexist, such as being both checkered and having brown color. But according to the dominance hierarchy, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot have brown (b) color. Because the dominance is such that the recessive allele for one trait masks the dominant one for the other. So a bird with c (checkered) would always be plain in color (since b is dominant). Similarly, a bird with B (brown) would always have red color (since b is recessive).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, but that seems redundant. Actually, the correct phenotypes are based on the combination of the two traits. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that's still four phenotypes, but some phenotypes are overlapping. Specifically, the third and fourth phenotypes are the same as the first and second respectively. So effectively, there are two unique phenotypes: checkered (both c and b) and plain (either c or b, but not both). Wait, no\u2014that's not right. The phenotypes are based on whether each trait is present or not. So:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (c) in pigment and brown (b) in color: Checkered red\n- If the bird is checkered in pigment but plain in color: Checkered brown\n- If plain in pigment but checkered in color: Plain red\n- If plain in pigment and plain in color: Plain brown\n\nSo, there are four possible phenotypes. However, depending on the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes might not exist. For example, if the pigment is completely dominant, then checkered (c) would mean the bird is red regardless of color. But in this case, since pigment is determined by C and c, and color by B and b, and they act independently, each bird will have a distinct phenotype based on the combination of the two traits.\n\nWait, but in reality, each trait is expressed separately. So a bird could have both traits expressed, resulting in a specific phenotype. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that's confusing. Actually, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: c_B\n2. Checkered brown: c_b\n3. Plain red: c_B (which is the same as 1, so perhaps I'm double-counting)\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are combinations of both traits. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nBut that suggests that Checkered red and Plain red are two phenotypes, and similarly for brown and plain. But wait, no\u2014each bird has both traits, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B)\n- Checkered brown (c_b)\n- Plain red (c_B)\n- Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because that would imply four phenotypes, but in reality, each trait is expressed independently, so the phenotypes would be combinations of the two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, in this scenario, the presence of one trait affects the expression of the other. For instance, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot be brown (b), and vice versa. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B)\n- Checkered brown (c_b)\n- Plain red (c_B)\n- Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that's still four phenotypes, but some phenotypes are duplicates. So perhaps the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nBut that\u2019s still four phenotypes. However, in reality, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nBut perhaps in terms of phenotypic ratios, we consider the possible combinations without worrying about duplication. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% each for the four phenotypes. However, looking back at the options, none of them reflect a 25% each. Instead, most options have varying numbers adding up to 16. This makes me think I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the two genes interact in a way that the presence of a certain allele masks the others. For example, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot be brown (b), and vice versa. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B)\n- Checkered brown (c_b)\n- Plain red (c_B)\n- Plain brown (c_b)\n\nBut in reality, the four phenotypes would overlap, making the count of unique phenotypes less than four. Wait, no\u2014each bird has both traits, so each bird must have either both traits or neither. But given the dominance hierarchy, if a bird is checkered (c), it can't be brown (b), and if it's brown (b), it can't be checkered (c). Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, but that's still four phenotypes, but some are duplicates. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the four phenotypes are equally likely, giving a phenotypic ratio of 25% each, but in practice, due to the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes may not occur together. However, in this problem, since the genes are independent and fully dominant, all four phenotypes should theoretically occur, each at 25%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the closest match seems to be option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. Wait, that can't be right because if each phenotype is 25%, they should be 4 each, but option G shows 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't make sense unless some phenotypes are not occurring due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this problem, both genes are fully dominant, so complete dominance applies, and all phenotypes should occur. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 4 each, but none of the options match this exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered bird is homozygous for the recessive allele (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous for the dominant allele (CC). The dihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So when these are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated. \n\nNow, considering the dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the two traits. Each trait is expressed independently, so the phenotypic ratio is determined by the squares of the coefficients for each gene. Since both genes are fully dominant, each phenotypic class is represented as follows:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B): 25%\n- Checkered brown (c_b): 25%\n- Plain red (c_B): 25%\n- Plain brown (c_b): 25%\n\nBut since some phenotypes may not coexist (e.g., if a bird were both checkered and brown, which isn't possible), the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nEach at 25%, totaling 100%. However, looking at the options, none seem to align perfectly with this. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That doesn't fit. Option D has 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Also doesn't fit. Option J has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Again, not matching. Option A has 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Total is 16, which fits. Option B has 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. Also totals 16. \n\nBut according to my analysis, each phenotype should occur at 25%. So why are the options showing larger numbers? Perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider. In genetic terms, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot be brown (b), and vice versa. So, the presence of one trait masks the other. Therefore, a bird that is checkered (c) cannot be brown (b); thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Always present.\n2. Checkered brown (c_b): Impossible.\n3. Plain red (c_B): Impossible.\n4. Plain brown (c_b): Impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a bird is checkered, it can't be brown, so brown is not possible. Conversely, if a bird is brown, it must be checkered. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): All checkered birds are red.\n2. Plain brown (c_b): All brown birds are plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 100%\n- Plain brown: 100%\n\nWhich would correspond to option A, where checkered red is 6, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 6, plain brown is 2. But that contradicts the previous understanding because if a bird is checkered, it's red, and if it's brown, it's plain. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 100% checkered red and 100% plain brown, leading to option A.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting conclusions based on how I interpret the dominance hierarchy. Earlier, I thought each trait was expressed independently, leading to four phenotypes, but now I'm seeing that checkered implies red, and brown implies plain, leading to two phenotypes. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nIn the context of dihybrid crosses with independent genes, each gene is considered separately. However, in this problem, the two genes are interacting because the presence of one trait affects the expression of the other. Specifically, a bird can only have one trait at a time: either it is checkered (c) and red (B), or it is brown (b) and plain (B). Therefore, the two genes are actually linked or functionally related, meaning that the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of each trait, not their interaction. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Can only happen if the bird is both checkered (c) and has red pigment (B).\n2. Brown (b): Only happens if the bird is brown (b) and has brown pigment (b), but wait, brown pigment requires at least one dominant B allele. Wait, no\u2014wait, if the bird is brown (b), it means it has at least one dominant B allele, but if it's also checkered (c), then it's c_B. Otherwise, if it's brown (b) but not checkered (cc), it would have brown color but not checkering, which isn't possible because brown is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele, and checkering is determined by recessive alleles. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Checkered (c): recessive allele for coat color.\n- Brown (B): dominant allele for coat color.\n\nIf a bird is checkered (c), it can't be brown (b). If it's brown (b), it can't be checkered (c). Therefore, a bird can only be either checkered (c) or brown (b), but not both. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Checkered (c) and red (B).\n2. Checkered brown (c_b): Checkered (c) and brown (b). Wait, no\u2014because if it's checkered (c), it can't be brown (b). So this would be impossible. Therefore, the only possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Checkered (c) and red (B).\n2. Brown (b): Brown (b) and whatever color it is. But since brown is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele, and checkering is recessive, a bird with at least one B allele and at least one c allele would be brown and not checkered. Wait, but if it's brown (b), does that mean it's brown regardless of coloration? No, brown is a separate trait. So, a bird that is brown (b) and has at least one B allele would be brown-colored, but not necessarily checkered. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that checkering is a separate trait from color. So a bird can be either checkered or brown, but not both. Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Checkered (c) and red (B).\n2. Brown (b): Brown (b) and whatever color it is. But since brown is determined by B, a bird with B would be brown, regardless of checkering. Wait, but if a bird is brown (b), it doesn't necessarily mean it's not checkered. Wait, confusion arises. Let me think again.\n\nThe two traits are coat color (B/b) and pigment color (B/b). They are independent. A bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (c): Always red (B), regardless of color.\n- Brown (b): Always brown (b), regardless",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the distribution of the phenotypes across the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Since each bird has two genes, each determining one trait, the number of possible phenotypes depends on how the dominance works. Since the traits are separate, each bird can express any of the four combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify. Each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Checkered red\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Plain red\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Checkered brown\n- Red pigment (C) and Brown color (B): Plain brown\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Plain pigment (c) and Brown color (B): Checkered brown\n- Plain pigment (c) and Brown color (B): Plain brown\n\nAnd same for blue and green, but in this case, we don't have another gene. Wait, no\u2014the problem states two genes: pigment (C and c) and color (B and b). So each bird has two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes based on the combination of the two traits. But the options given suggest that some phenotypes may not occur due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this case, the dominance is straightforward: dominant alleles are expressed, recessive are not. So, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C_B) | C_B | 25%\nPlain red (c_B) | c_B | 25%\nCheckered brown (C_b) | C_b | 25%\nPlain brown (c_b) | c_b | 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 25% each for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A-G include various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Perhaps the actual phenotypes aren't equally likely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of the recessive allele leads to different phenotypes. Wait, but according to standard Mendelian genetics, each phenotype is expressed based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles, regardless of the order. So the phenotypes are equally likely in a dihybrid cross where both genes are segregating independently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation considering the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are fully dominant, then the phenotypes would follow the sum of the probabilities squared. Wait, but in reality, each gene is independent, so the total phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% each. But none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check them again:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which doesn't add up to 16. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 16.\n\nHmm, so all options except A and B sum to 16. Option A sums to 6+2+6+2=16, and option B sums to 8+4+0+4=16. So why do I think the answer is different?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the problem is considering that some phenotypes cannot coexist, such as being both checkered and having brown color. But according to the dominance hierarchy, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot have brown (b) color. Because the dominance is such that the recessive allele for one trait masks the dominant one for the other. So a bird with c (checkered) would always be plain in color (since b is dominant). Similarly, a bird with B (brown) would always have red color (since b is recessive).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, but that seems redundant. Actually, the correct phenotypes are based on the combination of the two traits. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that's still four phenotypes, but some phenotypes are overlapping. Specifically, the third and fourth phenotypes are the same as the first and second respectively. So effectively, there are two unique phenotypes: checkered (both c and b) and plain (either c or b, but not both). Wait, no\u2014that's not right. The phenotypes are based on whether each trait is present or not. So:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (c) in pigment and brown (b) in color: Checkered red\n- If the bird is checkered in pigment but plain in color: Checkered brown\n- If plain in pigment but checkered in color: Plain red\n- If plain in pigment and plain in color: Plain brown\n\nSo, there are four possible phenotypes. However, depending on the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes might not exist. For example, if the pigment is completely dominant, then checkered (c) would mean the bird is red regardless of color. But in this case, since pigment is determined by C and c, and color by B and b, and they act independently, each bird will have a distinct phenotype based on the combination of the two traits.\n\nWait, but in reality, each trait is expressed separately. So a bird could have both traits expressed, resulting in a specific phenotype. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that's confusing. Actually, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: c_B\n2. Checkered brown: c_b\n3. Plain red: c_B (which is the same as 1, so perhaps I'm double-counting)\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are combinations of both traits. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nBut that suggests that Checkered red and Plain red are two phenotypes, and similarly for brown and plain. But wait, no\u2014each bird has both traits, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B)\n- Checkered brown (c_b)\n- Plain red (c_B)\n- Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because that would imply four phenotypes, but in reality, each trait is expressed independently, so the phenotypes would be combinations of the two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, in this scenario, the presence of one trait affects the expression of the other. For instance, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot be brown (b), and vice versa. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B)\n- Checkered brown (c_b)\n- Plain red (c_B)\n- Plain brown (c_b)\n\nWait, that's still four phenotypes, but some phenotypes are duplicates. So perhaps the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nBut that\u2019s still four phenotypes.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the four phenotypes are equally likely, giving a phenotypic ratio of 25% each, but in practice, due to the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes may not occur together. However, in this problem, since the genes are independent and fully dominant, all four phenotypes should theoretically occur, each at 25%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the closest match seems to be option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. Wait, that can't be right because if each phenotype is 25%, they should be 4 each, but option G shows 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't make sense unless some phenotypes are not occurring due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this problem, both genes are fully dominant, so complete dominance applies, and all phenotypes should occur. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 4 each, but none of the options match this exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered bird is homozygous for the recessive allele (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous for the dominant allele (CC). The dihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So when these are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated. \n\nNow, considering the dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the two traits. Each trait is expressed independently, so the phenotypic ratio is determined by the squares of the coefficients for each gene. Since both genes are fully dominant, each phenotypic class is represented as follows:\n\n- Checkered red (c_B): 25%\n- Checkered brown (c_b): 25%\n- Plain red (c_B): 25%\n- Plain brown (c_b): 25%\n\nBut since some phenotypes may not coexist (e.g., if a bird were both checkered and brown, which isn't possible), the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b)\n3. Plain red (c_B)\n4. Plain brown (c_b)\n\nEach at 25%, totaling 100%. However, looking at the options, none seem to align perfectly with this. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That doesn't fit. Option D has 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Also doesn't fit. Option J has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Again, not matching. Option A has 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Total is 16, which fits. Option B has 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. Also totals 16. \n\nBut according to my analysis, each phenotype should occur at 25%. So why are the options showing larger numbers? Perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider. In genetic terms, if a bird is checkered (c), it cannot be brown (b), and vice versa. So, the presence of one trait masks the other. Therefore, a bird that is checkered (c) cannot be brown (b); thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Always present.\n2. Checkered brown (c_b): Impossible.\n3. Plain red (c_B): Impossible.\n4. Plain brown (c_b): Impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a bird is checkered, it can't be brown, so brown is not possible. Conversely, if a bird is brown, it must be checkered. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): All checkered birds are red.\n2. Plain brown (c_b): All brown birds are plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 100%\n- Plain brown: 100%\n\nWhich would correspond to option A, where checkered red is 6, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 6, plain brown is 2. But that contradicts the previous understanding because if a bird is checkered, it's red, and if it's brown, it's plain. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 100% checkered red and 100% plain brown, leading to option A.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting conclusions based on how I interpret the dominance hierarchy. Earlier, I thought each trait was expressed independently, leading to four phenotypes, but now I'm seeing that checkered implies red, and brown implies plain, leading to two phenotypes. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nIn the context of dihybrid crosses with independent genes, each gene is considered separately. However, in this problem, the two genes are interacting because the presence of one trait affects the expression of the other. Specifically, a bird can only have one trait at a time: either it is checkered (c) and red (B), or it is brown (b) and plain (B). Therefore, the two genes are actually linked or functionally related, meaning that the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of each trait, not their interaction. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Can only happen if the bird is both checkered (c) and has red pigment (B).\n2. Brown (b): Only happens if the bird is brown (b) and has brown pigment (b), but wait, brown pigment requires at least one dominant B allele. Wait, no\u2014wait, if the bird is brown (b), it means it has at least one dominant B allele, but if it's also checkered (c), then it's c_B. Otherwise, if it's brown (b) but not checkered (cc), it would have brown color but not checkering, which isn't possible because brown is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele, and checkering is determined by recessive alleles. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Checkered (c): recessive allele for coat color.\n- Brown (B): dominant allele for coat color.\n\nIf a bird is checkered (c), it can't be brown (b). If it's brown (b), it can't be checkered (c). Therefore, a bird can only be either checkered (c) or brown (b), but not both. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Checkered (c) and red (B).\n2. Checkered brown (c_b): Checkered (c) and brown (b). Wait, no\u2014because if it's checkered (c), it can't be brown (b). So this would be impossible. Therefore, the only possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Checkered (c) and red (B).\n2. Brown (b): Brown (b) and whatever color it is. But since brown is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele, and checkering is recessive, a bird with at least one B allele and at least one c allele would be brown and not checkered. Wait, but if it's brown (b), does that mean it's brown regardless of coloration? No, brown is a separate trait. So, a bird that is brown (b) and has at least one B allele would be brown-colored, but not necessarily checkered. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that checkering is a separate trait from color. So a bird can be either checkered or brown, but not both. Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B): Checkered (c) and red (B).\n2. Brown (b): Brown (b) and whatever color it is. But since brown is determined by B, a bird with B would be brown, regardless of checkering. Wait, but if a bird is brown (b), it doesn't necessarily mean it's not checkered. Wait, confusion arises. Let me think again.\n\nThe two traits are coat color (B/b) and pigment color (B/b). They are independent. A bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (c): Always red (B), regardless of color.\n- Brown (b): Always brown (b), regardless",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the genetic makeup of the F2. Let's calculate the probabilities.

So the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor the body color gene (B/b):\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both traits. To calculate the phenotypic ratio, we consider each combination:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered Red (probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n- C and b: Plain Red (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n- c and B: Checkered Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n- c and b: Plain Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nBut wait, this assumes complete dominance where the presence of any dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. In reality, the presence of the dominant allele may lead to blending of traits, but the question states that the traits are determined by the dominant and recessive alleles. So under the assumption that each dominant allele fully expresses its trait, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, the options given don't match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nLooking at option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems like a ratio of 3:9:1:1, which doesn't fit our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the dominant phenotype, but the recessive is expressed differently. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the phenotypic expression isn't additive, but rather, the combination of both genes determines the phenotype without blending. So, perhaps each bird can only express one trait based on the dominant allele. For example, if a bird has C (picturized red), then regardless of the body color, it's red. Similarly, if it has c (plain), regardless of body color, it's plain. Same logic applies for B. So the phenotypes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Pigment red and color checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n3. Pigment plain and color brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Pigment plain and color checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWith equal probabilities, each occurring at 25%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nOption K:4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\nOption L:12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G\nOption M:5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match my previous thought. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 is not CcBb but something else. Let me go through the initial part again. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\n\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. So the F1 genotypes are CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb. So the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is F2) would involve these gametes.\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Homozygous checkered red\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 F1\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 F1\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Homozygous plain brown\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each with equal probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor gene C: C/C (probability 25%), C/c (50%), c/c (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B: B/B (25%), B/b (50%), b/b (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So each phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratios can be determined as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Red (probability 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 Plain Red (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 Plain Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to 4 equal parts. But none of the options match this. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering different ratios due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but according to the given information, each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check: the problem says a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be generated by selfing F1. As discussed, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, leading to 4 equal parts. But the options don't include 1:1:1:1. Instead, looking at option E: 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Option C:9:3:3:1, also sums to 16. Option H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. None matches 1:1:1:1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the genes' effects.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's determine the phenotypic ratios based on the possible genotypes and their expressions. For pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Checkered Red (CR)\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain Red (PR)\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown (Br)\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered (Ch)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. CR + Br \u2192 Checkered Red (CRBr)\n2. CR + Ch \u2192 Checkered Brown (CRCh)\n3. PR + Br \u2192 Plain Brown (PRBr)\n4. PR + Ch \u2192 Plain Red (PRCh)\n\nAssuming each dominant allele fully expresses its trait, the phenotypes are distinct. Therefore, each of these four phenotypes would occur with equal frequency, giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that, but the options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering the dominance hierarchy differently. For example, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the dominant phenotype, while the recessive leads to the recessive phenotype. In this case, the phenotypes would still be fourfold equally likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as considering the number of dominant alleles per gene, but that doesn't change the outcome significantly.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio in terms of the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, rather than exact counts. But even so, the ratios remain 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the F2 phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nIf each gene has two phenotypes, then the total number of phenotypes is 2 x 2 = 4. Each phenotype occurs with a probability of 1/4, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, none of the options match this. But looking at the options again, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16. Option C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16. Option H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. None of these have a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question is considering the dominance differently, or that the initial analysis was incorrect. Another possibility: Maybe the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but instead something else. Wait, the question states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is selfed.\n\nLet me verify the F2 genotypes again. The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 population consists of:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (F1)\n- 25% CcBb (F1)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Brown)\n\nBut this is before considering dominance. Since both genes are acting independently, each bird has four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene is controlled by a different pair of alleles, but the options suggest that the phenotypic ratio is based on a different calculation. Let me try to compute the actual phenotypic ratios based on the genetic makeup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying the dominance hierarchy. For instance, suppose that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the dominant phenotype, and the recessive leads to the recessive. But in this case, the four phenotypes are still present, each with equal likelihood.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options and see which makes sense. If the correct answer is supposed to have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not among the options, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance and consider only the number of possible phenotypes, which could be four, but the options don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the question clearly states F2.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps 'adihybrid' refers to a dihybrid cross, but the term 'adihybrid' is sometimes used to denote a cross between two heterozygotes. But in this case, the parents are homozygous. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the F2 generation would be based on the F1 cross, which itself comes from a dihybrid cross. So F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nIn that case, the F2 genotypes would be as previously: 25% CC BB, 25% CcBb, 25% CcBb, 25% cc bb. Then, applying dominance to each gene, each bird would have four possible phenotypes, each with 25% probability.\n\nBut again, the options don't reflect this. Perhaps the question is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the dominant phenotype, and the recessive leads to the recessive. But the four phenotypes remain, each with 25% chance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio. Wait, how does that come about?\n\nLet me recalculate: If each gene's effect combines, perhaps the number of dominant alleles affects the phenotype. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it becomes Checkered Red, otherwise, it's Plain Brown. But that would group some phenotypes together, reducing the number of phenotypes. Let me explore this possibility.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it's Checkered Red (CR).\n- Otherwise, it's Plain Brown (PB).\n\nThen, the possible genotypes would be:\n\n1. CC, B_: CR (both dominant)\n2. CC, bb: PB\n3. cc, B_: PB\n4. cc, bb: PB\n\nWait, but this grouping reduces the phenotypic ratio. However, in reality, each gene operates independently, so the phenotypes are still fourfold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the dominance in a way that combines both genes, resulting in a different phenotypic ratio. For example, if having at least one dominant allele in either gene leads to a specific phenotype, but the exact grouping would affect the ratio.\n\nBut this line of thinking complicates things further. Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the initial assumption that the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross between F1 and F1, but I've already considered that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotype ratio, but the question specifies F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach to calculate dominance ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that each gene has two phenotypes, leading to four phenotypes, each occurring at 25%, thus a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nLooking at the options, perhaps option E (3:9:1:3) is derived from a different calculation, possibly considering the number of dominant alleles in each gene separately. For instance, if the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to a certain phenotype, but the exact grouping leads to different ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the number of possible phenotypes is fewer due to dominance, but that contradicts standard Mendelian inheritance principles.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I think the most plausible answer is option E, as it reflects a common Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio of 1:1:1:1, although this isn't reflected in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't include this. Without further information, I'll select option E based on the reasoning that the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, despite it not being listed, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16, and option C is 9:3:3:1, which also adds to 16. These represent ratios where one phenotype is rare (1) and others are more frequent. Perhaps the question is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to a specific phenotype, but the calculations show different ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio is based on the number of possible combinations after considering dominance, leading to different ratios. For example, if the dominant allele in one gene masks the other, but that's not typically the case unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of possible phenotypes, treating each possible phenotype as separate, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since it's not an option, I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation's phenotype ratio is determined by the number of possible combinations of the dominant alleles in each gene, leading to different ratios. For example, for the pigment gene, the possible dominant alleles are C and c, and similarly for the body color. The phenotypic ratio would then be based on the product of the possible allele combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nGiven that, but since the options don't include this, perhaps I should revisit the question to ensure I understood it correctly. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, I'll proceed with option E (3:9:1:3), which is commonly cited in similar problems.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment: Red (C), Color: Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Pigment: Plain (c), Color: Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. Pigment: Red (C), Color: Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Pigment: Plain (c), Color: Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these combinations can occur independently, leading to four phenotypic classes. However, the actual probabilities might differ based on the dominance relationships.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the dominance is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor the body color gene (B/b):\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both traits. To calculate the phenotypic ratio, we consider each combination:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered Red (probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n- C and b: Plain Red (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n- c and B: Checkered Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n- c and b: Plain Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nBut wait, this assumes complete dominance where the presence of any dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. In reality, the presence of the dominant allele may lead to blending of traits, but the question states that the traits are determined by the dominant and recessive alleles. So under the assumption that each dominant allele fully expresses its trait, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, the options given don't match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nLooking at option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems like a ratio of 3:9:1:1, which doesn't fit our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the dominant phenotype, but the recessive is expressed differently. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the phenotypic expression isn't additive, but rather, the combination of both genes determines the phenotype without blending. So, perhaps each bird can only express one trait based on the dominant allele. For example, if a bird has C (picturized red), then regardless of the body color, it's red. Similarly, if it has c (plain), regardless of body color, it's plain. Same logic applies for B. So the phenotypes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and color brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Pigment red and color checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n3. Pigment plain and color brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Pigment plain and color checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWith equal probabilities, each occurring at 25%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nOption K:4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\nOption L:12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G\nOption M:5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match my previous thought. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 is not CcBb but something else. Let me go through the initial part again. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\n\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. So the F1 genotypes are CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb. So the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is F2) would involve these gametes.\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Homozygous checkered red\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 F1\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 F1\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Homozygous plain brown\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each with equal probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor gene C: C/C (probability 25%), C/c (50%), c/c (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B: B/B (25%), B/b (50%), b/b (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So each phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratios can be determined as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Red (probability 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 Plain Red (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 Plain Brown (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to 4 equal parts. But none of the options match this. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering different ratios due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but according to the given information, each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check: the problem says a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be generated by selfing F1. As discussed, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, leading to 4 equal parts. But the options don't include 1:1:1:1. Instead, looking at option E: 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Option C:9:3:3:1, also sums to 16. Option H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. None matches 1:1:1:1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the genes' effects.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's determine the phenotypic ratios based on the possible genotypes and their expressions. For pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Checkered Red (CR)\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain Red (PR)\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown (Br)\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered (Ch)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. CR + Br \u2192 Checkered Red (CRBr)\n2. CR + Ch \u2192 Checkered Brown (CRCh)\n3. PR + Br \u2192 Plain Brown (PRBr)\n4. PR + Ch \u2192 Plain Red (PRCh)\n\nAssuming each dominant allele fully expresses its trait, the phenotypes are distinct. Therefore, each of these four phenotypes would occur with equal frequency, giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that, but the options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering the dominance hierarchy differently. For example, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the dominant phenotype, while the recessive leads to the recessive phenotype. In this case, the phenotypes would still be fourfold equally likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as considering the number of dominant alleles per gene, but that doesn't change the outcome significantly.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio in terms of the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, rather than exact counts. But even so, the ratios remain 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the F2 phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nIf each gene has two phenotypes, then the total number of phenotypes is 2 x 2 = 4. Each phenotype occurs with a probability of 1/4, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, none of the options match this. But looking at the options again, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16. Option C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16. Option H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. None of these have a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question is considering the dominance differently, or that the initial analysis was incorrect. Another possibility: Maybe the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but instead something else. Wait, the question states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is selfed.\n\nLet me verify the F2 genotypes again. The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 population consists of:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (F1)\n- 25% CcBb (F1)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Brown)\n\nBut this is before considering dominance. Since both genes are acting independently, each bird has four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene is controlled by a different pair of alleles, but the options suggest that the phenotypic ratio is based on a different calculation. Let me try to compute the actual phenotypic ratios based on the genetic makeup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying the dominance hierarchy. For instance, suppose that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the dominant phenotype, and the recessive leads to the recessive. But in this case, the four phenotypes are still present, each with equal likelihood.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options and see which makes sense. If the correct answer is supposed to have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not among the options, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance and consider only the number of possible phenotypes, which could be four, but the options don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the question clearly states F2.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps 'adihybrid' refers to a dihybrid cross, but the term 'adihybrid' is sometimes used to denote a cross between two heterozygotes. But in this case, the parents are homozygous. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the F2 generation would be based on the F1 cross, which itself comes from a dihybrid cross. So F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nIn that case, the F2 genotypes would be as previously: 25% CC BB, 25% CcBb, 25% CcBb, 25% cc bb. Then, applying dominance to each gene, each bird would have four possible phenotypes, each with 25% probability.\n\nBut again, the options don't reflect this. Perhaps the question is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the dominant phenotype, and the recessive leads to the recessive. But the four phenotypes remain, each with 25% chance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio. Wait, how does that come about?\n\nLet me recalculate: If each gene's effect combines, perhaps the number of dominant alleles affects the phenotype. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it becomes Checkered Red, otherwise, it's Plain Brown. But that would group some phenotypes together, reducing the number of phenotypes. Let me explore this possibility.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it's Checkered Red (CR).\n- Otherwise, it's Plain Brown (PB).\n\nThen, the possible genotypes would be:\n\n1. CC, B_: CR (both dominant)\n2. CC, bb: PB\n3. cc, B_: PB\n4. cc, bb: PB\n\nWait, but this grouping reduces the phenotypic ratio. However, in reality, each gene operates independently, so the phenotypes are still fourfold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the dominance in a way that combines both genes, resulting in a different phenotypic ratio. For example, if having at least one dominant allele in either gene leads to a specific phenotype, but the exact grouping would affect the ratio.\n\nBut this line of thinking complicates things further. Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the initial assumption that the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross between F1 and F1, but I've already considered that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotype ratio, but the question specifies F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach to calculate dominance ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that each gene has two phenotypes, leading to four phenotypes, each occurring at 25%, thus a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nLooking at the options, perhaps option E (3:9:1:3) is derived from a different calculation, possibly considering the number of dominant alleles in each gene separately. For instance, if the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to a certain phenotype, but the exact grouping leads to different ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the number of possible phenotypes is fewer due to dominance, but that contradicts standard Mendelian inheritance principles.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I think the most plausible answer is option E, as it reflects a common Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio of 1:1:1:1, although this isn't reflected in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't include this. Without further information, I'll select option E based on the reasoning that the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, despite it not being listed, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16, and option C is 9:3:3:1, which also adds to 16. These represent ratios where one phenotype is rare (1) and others are more frequent. Perhaps the question is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to a specific phenotype, but the calculations show different ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio is based on the number of possible combinations after considering dominance, leading to different ratios. For example, if the dominant allele in one gene masks the other, but that's not typically the case unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of possible phenotypes, treating each possible phenotype as separate, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since it's not an option, I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation's phenotype ratio is determined by the number of possible combinations of the dominant alleles in each gene, leading to different ratios. For example, for the pigment gene, the possible dominant alleles are C and c, and similarly for the body color. The phenotypic ratio would then be based on the product of the possible allele combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nGiven that, but since the options don't include this, perhaps I should revisit the question to ensure I understood it correctly. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, I'll proceed with option E (3:9:1:3), which is commonly cited in similar problems.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, but the options given are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability of each phenotype directly.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a bird having a certain phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nLet me create a table for all four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n2. Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND checkered (b): 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are approximately 4:2:2:1. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios. Option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit our calculation. Option J has 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option D suggests 1:3:9:3, which seems like a trihybrid approach, but here we have two genes. Maybe the question is mixing up genes. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't additive, so some traits might mask others. Alternatively, perhaps the initial analysis was incorrect regarding the number of phenotypes.\n\nWait, another thought: in reality, when both genes are considered, the number of phenotypes could be less due to dominance. For example, if the presence of both dominant alleles results in the same phenotype, then fewer phenotypes emerge. In this case, however, each gene contributes independently, so unless dominance plays a role across both genes, the number of phenotypes remains four. But looking back at the options, none directly reflect 4:2:2:1. Instead, option G is 12:2:2:0, which implies 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one gene affecting each trait, but the way it's phrased, it's two genes influencing each trait separately. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I haven't misinterpreted anything.\n\nThe problem states that checkered red is CC BB, and plain brown is cc bb. The genes are C and B, determining pigment and color respectively. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b).\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the dihybrid cross of CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2). Wait, but actually, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself. So the F2 would include all possible combinations of Cc and Bb from the parents. So the possible genotypes for each gene are C (dominant) and c (recessive), and similarly for B and b.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each parent is CcBb, so the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be any combination where each gene is C/C, C/c, c/c, and B/B, B/b, b/b. But since the F1 is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, this is a dihybrid cross, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but scaled by the number of phenotypic categories. But in reality, each gene has multiple phenotypic expressions, leading to more complex ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and treating each gene independently, leading to four phenotypes with specific ratios.\n\nBut looking back, the options don't have a 4:2:2:1 ratio. They have ratios like 12:2:2:0, which suggests 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. This would imply that only checkered and plain colors exist, without brown. But according to our earlier analysis, brown (B) is an independent trait, so brown should appear in the F2 generation. Unless dominance over B masks the effect of b, but that depends on whether the dominance relationships are hierarchical. If both genes are working, then brown should still express.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering only one gene for each trait, but the wording suggests two separate genes influencing each trait. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, let's consider the actual possible phenotypes and their counts. Each bird has two traits: pigment color (C) and body color (B). Each trait can be either dominant (C or B) or recessive (c or b). The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we need to compute the probabilities of each combination occurring in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach bird is a dihybrid individual (Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb), so the F2 would have the following probabilities:\n\n- Probability of pigment red (C): 3/4\n- Probability of pigment plain (c): 1/4\n- Probability of body brown (B): 3/4\n- Probability of body checkered (b): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is the product of these:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Plain red (C and b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Checkered brown (c and B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain brown (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But this is for a trihybrid scenario, but here we have two genes, so each part corresponds to a unique combination.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, they have various numbers adding up to 16. Looking at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16, but with different ratios. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also adds up to 12, so that can't be right. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, but that would require a trihybrid, which isn't applicable here. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar to G but reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering dominance across both genes. For example, if both dominant alleles must be present for a phenotype to manifest. In such cases, the phenotype hierarchy might change. Let me assume that the presence of both dominant alleles (C and B) leads to the most distinct phenotype, followed by the presence of dominant C and recessive B, etc. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of both dominant alleles hides the recessive ones, leading to a dominant phenotype. But without explicit dominance information, it's hard to say. Given that the options provided, option G's 12:2:2:0 seems plausible if the dominant phenotype is overrepresented. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, checkered red is 9/16, checkered brown is 3/16, plain red is 3/16, plain brown is 1/16. So in terms of counts, 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G is 12:2:2:0. That would suggest 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't align with our calculation. Perhaps the question is considering that when both dominant alleles are present, the phenotype is the same, thus reducing the number of phenotypes. For example, if both C and B are needed for a particular phenotype, the others may fall into a single category. But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly setting up the phenotypes, and only three phenotypes exist instead of four. For instance, if brown (B) is always dominant over checkered (b), making plain brown (b) non-existent. But that contradicts the problem statement which clearly mentions checkered and brown as distinct phenotypes.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 12:2:2:0, implying that checkered red is the most common phenotype, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and plain brown is rare or absent. But according to our calculations, plain brown should occur 1/16 of the time, while plain red is 3/16, checkered brown is 3/16, and checkered red is 9/16. None of the options match this exactly, except perhaps option G, which has 12:2:2:0, summing to 16. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that only one gene affects the phenotype, but the problem explicitly lists two genes. Alternatively, maybe the question is counting only visible traits regardless of dominance, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that both genes are required for a phenotype, making some phenotypes impossible. For example, if both C and B are necessary to display a certain color, then some combinations wouldn't exist. But that would complicate the count beyond what's provided in the options.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is option G, which suggests 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. According to our calculations, checkered red is 9/16, which would correspond to 9 units, but option G has 12. That discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is considering only one gene for each trait, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. For example, checkered red requires at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). Plain red requires at least one recessive allele for pigment (c) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). Similarly, checkered brown requires at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and at least one recessive color allele (b). Plain brown requires at least one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one recessive color allele (b). But even then, the phenotypic ratios would differ.\n\nIn this case, the number of phenotypes would be limited, but the options provided indicate multiple phenotypes. Without clear instructions, it's challenging to proceed, but based on the options and assuming the question intends for each gene to contribute to the phenotype independently, the most likely intended answer is option G: 12:2:2:0.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, but the options given are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability of each phenotype directly.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a bird having a certain phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nLet me create a table for all four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n2. Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND checkered (b): 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are approximately 4:2:2:1. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios. Option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit our calculation. Option J has 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option D suggests 1:3:9:3, which seems like a trihybrid approach, but here we have two genes. Maybe the question is mixing up genes. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't additive, so some traits might mask others. Alternatively, perhaps the initial analysis was incorrect regarding the number of phenotypes.\n\nWait, another thought: in reality, when both genes are considered, the number of phenotypes could be less due to dominance. For example, if the presence of both dominant alleles results in the same phenotype, then fewer phenotypes emerge. In this case, however, each gene contributes independently, so unless dominance plays a role across both genes, the number of phenotypes remains four. But looking back at the options, none directly reflect 4:2:2:1. Instead, option G is 12:2:2:0, which implies 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one gene affecting each trait, but the way it's phrased, it's two genes influencing each trait separately. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I haven't misinterpreted anything.\n\nThe problem states that checkered red is CC BB, and plain brown is cc bb. The genes are C and B, determining pigment and color respectively. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b).\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the dihybrid cross of CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2). Wait, but actually, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself. So the F2 would include all possible combinations of Cc and Bb from the parents. So the possible genotypes for each gene are C (dominant) and c (recessive), and similarly for B and b.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each parent is CcBb, so the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be any combination where each gene is C/C, C/c, c/c, and B/B, B/b, b/b. But since the F1 is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, this is a dihybrid cross, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but scaled by the number of phenotypic categories. But in reality, each gene has multiple phenotypic expressions, leading to more complex ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and treating each gene independently, leading to four phenotypes with specific ratios.\n\nBut looking back, the options don't have a 4:2:2:1 ratio. They have ratios like 12:2:2:0, which suggests 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. This would imply that only checkered and plain colors exist, without brown. But according to our earlier analysis, brown (B) is an independent trait, so brown should appear in the F2 generation. Unless dominance over B masks the effect of b, but that depends on whether the dominance relationships are hierarchical. If both genes are working, then brown should still express.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering only one gene for each trait, but the wording suggests two separate genes influencing each trait. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, let's consider the actual possible phenotypes and their counts. Each bird has two traits: pigment color (C) and body color (B). Each trait can be either dominant (C or B) or recessive (c or b). The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we need to compute the probabilities of each combination occurring in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach bird is a dihybrid individual (Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb), so the F2 would have the following probabilities:\n\n- Probability of pigment red (C): 3/4\n- Probability of pigment plain (c): 1/4\n- Probability of body brown (B): 3/4\n- Probability of body checkered (b): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is the product of these:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Plain red (C and b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Checkered brown (c and B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain brown (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But this is for a trihybrid scenario, but here we have two genes, so each part corresponds to a unique combination.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, they have various numbers adding up to 16. Looking at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16, but with different ratios. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also adds up to 12, so that can't be right. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, but that would require a trihybrid, which isn't applicable here. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar to G but reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering dominance across both genes. For example, if both dominant alleles must be present for a phenotype to manifest. In such cases, the phenotype hierarchy might change. Let me assume that the presence of both dominant alleles (C and B) leads to the most distinct phenotype, followed by the presence of dominant C and recessive B, etc. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of both dominant alleles hides the recessive ones, leading to a dominant phenotype. But without explicit dominance information, it's hard to say. Given that the options provided, option G's 12:2:2:0 seems plausible if the dominant phenotype is overrepresented. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, checkered red is 9/16, checkered brown is 3/16, plain red is 3/16, plain brown is 1/16. So in terms of counts, 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G is 12:2:2:0. That would suggest 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't align with our calculation. Perhaps the question is considering that when both dominant alleles are present, the phenotype is the same, thus reducing the number of phenotypes. For example, if both C and B are needed for a particular phenotype, the others may fall into a single category. But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly setting up the phenotypes, and only three phenotypes exist instead of four. For instance, if brown (B) is always dominant over checkered (b), making plain brown (b) non-existent. But that contradicts the problem statement which clearly mentions checkered and brown as distinct phenotypes.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 12:2:2:0, implying that checkered red is the most common phenotype, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and plain brown is rare or absent. But according to our calculations, plain brown should occur 1/16 of the time, while plain red is 3/16, checkered brown is 3/16, and checkered red is 9/16. None of the options match this exactly, except perhaps option G, which has 12:2:2:0, summing to 16. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that only one gene affects the phenotype, but the problem explicitly lists two genes. Alternatively, maybe the question is counting only visible traits regardless of dominance, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that both genes are required for a phenotype, making some phenotypes impossible. For example, if both C and B are necessary to display a certain color, then some combinations wouldn't exist. But that would complicate the count beyond what's provided in the options.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is option G, which suggests 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. According to our calculations, checkered red is 9/16, which would correspond to 9 units, but option G has 12. That discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is considering only one gene for each trait, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. For example, checkered red requires at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). Plain red requires at least one recessive allele for pigment (c) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). Similarly, checkered brown requires at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and at least one recessive color allele (b). Plain brown requires at least one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one recessive color allele (b). But even then, the phenotypic ratios would differ.\n\nIn this case, the number of phenotypes would be limited, but the options provided indicate multiple phenotypes. Without clear instructions, it's challenging to proceed, but based on the options and assuming the question intends for each gene to contribute to the phenotype independently, the most likely intended answer is option G: 12:2:2:0.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by looking at the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C_: 75% (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c_: 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B_: 75%\n- Probability of b_: 25%\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C_ and B_: (75%)(75%) = 56.25%\n2. C_ and b_: (75%)(25%) = 18.75%\n3. c_ and B_: (25%)(75%) = 18.75%\n4. c_ and b_: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. Simplifying this by dividing each by 6.25 gives us 9:3:3:1. But wait, let me double-check the math. Adding up 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 equals 100%, which checks out. So the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. That corresponds to option H: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, hold on\u2014the options listed don't exactly match my simplified ratios. Let me see:\n\nWait, the actual counts based on the 9:3:3:1 ratio would mean:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Checkered Red (which includes both C_ and B_, and c_ and b_) \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype 2: Checkered Brown (only C_ and B_) \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype 3: Plain Red (only c_ and B_) \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4: Plain Brown (only c_ and b_) \u2192 1 part\n\nAdding up 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't align.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Reversed.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not exact.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 4:4:4:4, which doesn't fit.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes!

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene:",
    "rollout": " So for each gene:\n\n- Pigment color (C/B):\n   - Presence (C): red\n   - Absence (c): plain\n- Body color (B/b):\n   - Presence (B): brown\n   - Absence (b): checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigmented and brown: red-brown\n2. Pigmented and checkered: red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown: plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered: plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- 50% chance C (red)\n- 50% chance c (plain)\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- 50% chance B (brown)\n- 50% chance b (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined probabilities are 25% for each of the four possible phenotypic combinations. However, some phenotypes might combine into one if the alleles are dominant over recessive. For example, if an animal is Cc for pigment and Bb for body color, it could be either red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, or plain-checkered. But in reality, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So regardless of the actual alleles, the phenotype is determined by whether the dominant allele is present. \n\nWait, but in this case, the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So for pigment color, any C results in red, and any c results in plain. Similarly for body color. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and brown: red-brown\n2. Pigmented and checkered: red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown: plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered: plain-checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur at a 1:1:1:1 ratio because each gene contributes equally, and the genes are independent. So, in a large population, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. However, the question asks for the specific ratio given in the options. Let's look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H list different ratios. Looking at them, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my expectation of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G also suggests a similar distribution but with checkered being less frequent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Usually, the recessive allele is the one that makes an organism appear as a certain phenotype. If \"checkered\" is the recessive phenotype, then \"plain\" must be the dominant phenotype for that trait. Similarly, for color: \"red\" is dominant, and \"brown\" is dominant. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n   - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n- For body color (B):\n   - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n   - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Now, looking at the options, none seem to match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me double-check the possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that having at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype. So for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. Therefore, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented and brown: red-brown\n2. Pigmented and checkered: red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown: plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered: plain-checkered\n\nAnd each would have a 25% chance. So in a large population, the ratio would be 25% for each. But the options don't reflect that. Instead, they suggest ratios like 1:3 for checkered compared to red.\n\nLooking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because if all phenotypes are equally likely, there shouldn't be zero plain brown. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the problem assumes that checkered is the recessive phenotype, meaning it's always present, while plain is dominant. Similarly, brown is dominant, and red is recessive. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf \"checkered\" is recessive (c), meaning it's always expressed, then:\n\n- The bird is always checkered if it has at least one c allele (since c is recessive).\n- For the pigment color, if the bird is checkered (has at least one c), then the pigment color is determined by the other gene. Since c is recessive, if the bird is checkered, the pigment color (C) would be dominant, resulting in red if C is present, otherwise plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B), if the bird is checkered (has at least one c), then the color is determined by the other gene. Since b is dominant (as it's the recessive allele for the B locus?), wait no\u2014if \"b\" is recessive for the B locus, then having at least one B (dominant) results in brown, and at least one b (recessive) results in checkered. But if checkered is due to recessive alleles, then for B, having a dominant allele (B) would make the bird brown, and having a recessive (b) would make it checkered.\n\nBut now, let me clarify:\n\n- \"Checkered\" is determined by recessive allele c.\n- \"Plain\" is dominant, so presence of C allele (dominant) results in plain.\n- \"Brown\" is determined by dominant allele B (assuming B is dominant for brown, so presence of B makes it brown, else checkered).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the problem says \"red\" is determined by C, so if C is present, it's red. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, \"brown\" is determined by B, so if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered. And \"checkered\" is determined by recessive c. So:\n\n- For pigment color: C (present) \u2192 red; c (present) \u2192 plain.\n- For body color: B (present) \u2192 brown; b (present) \u2192 checkered.\n\nNow, if \"checkered\" is recessive (i.e., requires at least one c), then a bird is checkered if it has at least one c allele. Otherwise, it's plain (if C is present) or brown (if c is present). So let's model this.\n\nThe parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both alleles for C and B are dominant.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 both alleles for c and b are recessive.\n\nWhen crossing these two, the F1 would be all CB, since Parent 1 can only give CB (both dominant) and Parent 2 can only give cb (both recessive). Therefore, F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nIn F2, each gene segregates independently. For pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 25% + 50% (from CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB, cb + cb)\nWait, no\u2014actually, for each gene, the segregation is independent. So for pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly for body color (B/b):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore:\n\n- Probability of both C and B (red and brown) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Probability of C and b (red and checkered) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of c and B (plain and brown) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of c and b (plain and checkered) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red-Brown (9/16)\n2. Red-Checkered (3/16)\n3. Plain-Brown (3/16)\n4. Plain-Checkered (1/16)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options, let me see:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems like a 1:3:9:9 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Again, a 12:2:2:0 ratio, which doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the question isn't about the proportion of each phenotype but rather the number of each type in terms of F2 generation. Let me consider how many F2 individuals would express each phenotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 would consist of 16 individuals (since each gene segregates into two, leading to 2^4=16 possible combinations for the four phenotypic categories). But actually, for each trait, the number is 2^n where n is the number of loci, but since we have two loci, each with three phenotypes, it's a bit more complicated. However, according to Mendelian inheritance, each gene segregates into two, leading to 2*2=4 phenotypic classes, each with 1/4 frequency.\n\nTherefore, in F2, each phenotype would have 1/4 of the population. So 16 birds in total, with 4 in each category.\n\nHowever, the options don't reflect that. Instead, they list numbers indicating the count for each phenotype. Let's calculate:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds.\n\nAccording to our earlier analysis:\n\n- 9/16: Red-Brown \u2192 9 birds\n- 3/16: Red-Checkered \u2192 3 birds\n- 3/16: Plain-Brown \u2192 3 birds\n- 1/16: Plain-Checkered \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\nRed-Brown: 9\n\nRed-Checkered: 3\n\nPlain-Brown: 3\n\nPlain-Checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options directly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 That matches exactly what I just calculated: 1,3,9,3.\n\nYes! So option D lists the counts as:\n\n- checkered red: 1\n\n- checkered brown: 3\n\n- plain red: 9\n\n- plain brown: 3\n\nWhich adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, matching the total number of F2 birds. Therefore, option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each gene:\n\n- Pigment color (C/B):\n   - Presence (C): red\n   - Absence (c): plain\n- Body color (B/b):\n   - Presence (B): brown\n   - Absence (b): checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigmented and brown: red-brown\n2. Pigmented and checkered: red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown: plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered: plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- 50% chance C (red)\n- 50% chance c (plain)\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- 50% chance B (brown)\n- 50% chance b (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined probabilities are 25% for each of the four possible phenotypic combinations. However, some phenotypes might combine into one if the alleles are dominant over recessive. For example, if an animal is Cc for pigment and Bb for body color, it could be either red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, or plain-checkered. But in reality, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So regardless of the actual alleles, the phenotype is determined by whether the dominant allele is present. \n\nWait, but in this case, the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So for pigment color, any C results in red, and any c results in plain. Similarly for body color. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and brown: red-brown\n2. Pigmented and checkered: red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown: plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered: plain-checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur at a 1:1:1:1 ratio because each gene contributes equally, and the genes are independent. So, in a large population, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. However, the question asks for the specific ratio given in the options. Let's look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H list different ratios. Looking at them, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my expectation of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G also suggests a similar distribution but with checkered being less frequent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Usually, the recessive allele is the one that makes an organism appear as a certain phenotype. If \"checkered\" is the recessive phenotype, then \"plain\" must be the dominant phenotype for that trait. Similarly, for color: \"red\" is dominant, and \"brown\" is dominant. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n   - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n- For body color (B):\n   - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n   - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Now, looking at the options, none seem to match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me double-check the possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that having at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype. So for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype. Therefore, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented and brown: red-brown\n2. Pigmented and checkered: red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown: plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered: plain-checkered\n\nAnd each would have a 25% chance. So in a large population, the ratio would be 25% for each. But the options don't reflect that. Instead, they suggest ratios like 1:3 for checkered compared to red.\n\nLooking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because if all phenotypes are equally likely, there shouldn't be zero plain brown. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the problem assumes that checkered is the recessive phenotype, meaning it's always present, while plain is dominant. Similarly, brown is dominant, and red is recessive. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf \"checkered\" is recessive (c), meaning it's always expressed, then:\n\n- The bird is always checkered if it has at least one c allele (since c is recessive).\n- For the pigment color, if the bird is checkered (has at least one c), then the pigment color is determined by the other gene. Since c is recessive, if the bird is checkered, the pigment color (C) would be dominant, resulting in red if C is present, otherwise plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B), if the bird is checkered (has at least one c), then the color is determined by the other gene. Since b is dominant (as it's the recessive allele for the B locus?), wait no\u2014if \"b\" is recessive for the B locus, then having at least one B (dominant) results in brown, and at least one b (recessive) results in checkered. But if checkered is due to recessive alleles, then for B, having a dominant allele (B) would make the bird brown, and having a recessive (b) would make it checkered.\n\nBut now, let me clarify:\n\n- \"Checkered\" is determined by recessive allele c.\n- \"Plain\" is dominant, so presence of C allele (dominant) results in plain.\n- \"Brown\" is determined by dominant allele B (assuming B is dominant for brown, so presence of B makes it brown, else checkered).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the problem says \"red\" is determined by C, so if C is present, it's red. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, \"brown\" is determined by B, so if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered. And \"checkered\" is determined by recessive c. So:\n\n- For pigment color: C (present) \u2192 red; c (present) \u2192 plain.\n- For body color: B (present) \u2192 brown; b (present) \u2192 checkered.\n\nNow, if \"checkered\" is recessive (i.e., requires at least one c), then a bird is checkered if it has at least one c allele. Otherwise, it's plain (if C is present) or brown (if c is present). So let's model this.\n\nThe parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both alleles for C and B are dominant.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 both alleles for c and b are recessive.\n\nWhen crossing these two, the F1 would be all CB, since Parent 1 can only give CB (both dominant) and Parent 2 can only give cb (both recessive). Therefore, F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nIn F2, each gene segregates independently. For pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 25% + 50% (from CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB, cb + cb)\nWait, no\u2014actually, for each gene, the segregation is independent. So for pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly for body color (B/b):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore:\n\n- Probability of both C and B (red and brown) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Probability of C and b (red and checkered) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of c and B (plain and brown) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of c and b (plain and checkered) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red-Brown (9/16)\n2. Red-Checkered (3/16)\n3. Plain-Brown (3/16)\n4. Plain-Checkered (1/16)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options, let me see:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems like a 1:3:9:9 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Again, a 12:2:2:0 ratio, which doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the question isn't about the proportion of each phenotype but rather the number of each type in terms of F2 generation. Let me consider how many F2 individuals would express each phenotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 would consist of 16 individuals (since each gene segregates into two, leading to 2^4=16 possible combinations for the four phenotypic categories). But actually, for each trait, the number is 2^n where n is the number of loci, but since we have two loci, each with three phenotypes, it's a bit more complicated. However, according to Mendelian inheritance, each gene segregates into two, leading to 2*2=4 phenotypic classes, each with 1/4 frequency.\n\nTherefore, in F2, each phenotype would have 1/4 of the population. So 16 birds in total, with 4 in each category.\n\nHowever, the options don't reflect that. Instead, they list numbers indicating the count for each phenotype. Let's calculate:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds.\n\nAccording to our earlier analysis:\n\n- 9/16: Red-Brown \u2192 9 birds\n- 3/16: Red-Checkered \u2192 3 birds\n- 3/16: Plain-Brown \u2192 3 birds\n- 1/16: Plain-Checkered \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\nRed-Brown: 9\n\nRed-Checkered: 3\n\nPlain-Brown: 3\n\nPlain-Checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options directly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 That matches exactly what I just calculated: 1,3,9,3.\n\nYes! So option D lists the counts as:\n\n- checkered red: 1\n\n- checkered brown: 3\n\n- plain red: 9\n\n- plain brown: 3\n\nWhich adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, matching the total number of F2 birds. Therefore, option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "rollout": " Since each gene has two alleles, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor Pigment:\n- Presence (Red): C present\n- Absence (Plain): c absent (since c is recessive)\n\nWait, no, c is recessive, so presence means the bird has at least one C allele. Similarly, for B:\n- Presence (Brown): B present\n- Absence (Checkered): b absent.\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the phenotype can be represented as a combination of these two traits. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (both traits present)\n- Checkered Brown (B present, b absent)\n- Plain Red (c absent, B absent)\n- Plain Brown (c absent, B present)\n\nSo each bird has one of these four phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the proportion of each genotype in the F2 population. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian ratio. For each gene, the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio (dominant: recessive = 3:1), but combined across two genes, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, where each term corresponds to the number of birds with each phenotype. Let me verify that.\n\nWait, no, each gene has a 3:1 ratio, but when considering two independent genes, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

So the phenotypes are distinct unless certain conditions apply. But since each bird has two independent genes, the number of possible phenotypic categories is 2x2=4, but some may combine into fewer categories due to dominance.

Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nWe need to determine how many of these phenotypes occur in the F2 generation.\n\nLet's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: C_b_ \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: c_B_ \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 4: c_b_ \u2192 25%\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for dominance properly because some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014if both traits are expressed, each phenotype is distinct. So, the distribution remains 25% for each phenotype.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of those traits. If both traits are expressed, the phenotype is determined by the combination. Since each gene acts independently, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for each phenotype. But wait, each bird has two traits, so the actual numbers would be:\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds (since 4 x 4).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red and Brown: 4 birds\n- Red and Checkered: 4 birds\n- Plain and Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 birds\n\nBut that's not accurate because the distribution isn't uniform across all combinations. Wait, no\u2014it's based on the independent assortment. Each gene assorts independently, so the phenotypic ratio should reflect the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014each trait is expressed independently. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. But looking at the options given, none of them have equal ratios. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOptions A through H list specific ratios like 6:2:6:2, which sum up to 16, matching the F2 size (4x4=16). So the correct option must show a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but none of the options seem to match that exactly. Wait, checking the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. That seems to fit because checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. Adding up to 16.\n\nAnother possibility is Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 9 \u2192 Also adds up to 16.\n\nBut according to our previous reasoning, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options directly state that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe the way the phenotypes are counted is different. Perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the plain color, which is determined by the recessive allele c. So, plain color could mean either checkered or something else. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that plain color is determined by c, so checkered is determined by b. So \"checkered\" implies the presence of the recessive allele, while \"plain\" is the dominant.\n\nIn terms of pigmentation, \"red\" is dominant (C), and \"brown\" is dominant (B). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nSince each trait is expressed independently, each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none provide such a ratio. Instead, all options have specific numbers adding up to 16. So perhaps the question expects us to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another approach: Using a Punnett square for F2. Let me construct it.\n\nParental cross: F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nThe F2 would come from F1 selfing, which results in the following:\n\nGametes from F1 (CcBb): CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%)\n\nF2 genotypes:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cB: Cc (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (25%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014this approach is confusing. Alternatively, the Punnett square for F2 would involve the combination of gametes from F1.\n\nAlternatively, since F1 is CcBb, F2 is generated by crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The Punnett square for this would be:\n\n          | C | c\n        -----------------\n        C     | CC | Cc\n        c      | Cc | cc\n\nSimilarly for B alleles:\n\n          | B | b\n        -----------------\n        B     | BB | Bb\n        b      | Bb | bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Cc BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each bird is characterized by both traits, so the correct way is:\n\n- CC BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Cc BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): CC BB, Cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up the counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 2 birds (1 and 4)\n- Phenotype 2: 2 birds (2 and 5)\n- Phenotype 3: 3 birds (3,6,7)\n- Phenotype 4: 3 birds (8,9)\n\nWait, but that sums to 2+2+3+3=10, but there are 16 birds. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the F2 as a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a bird's genotype, then map to phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number based on the probabilities.\n\nGiven that each bird has four possible combinations of alleles, and each combination leads to a specific phenotype, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would be proportional to the number of each genotype.\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the cases. Since there are 16 birds, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But that contradicts the earlier counting.\n\nWait, no\u2014the Punnett square shows that each combination (like CC BB) occurs once in the 16 birds. So, the number of each phenotype should be based on how many genotypic combinations correspond to each phenotype.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n\nWait, that still doesn't add up correctly. Let me make a table:\n\nBird Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | 1\nCC Bb | 2\nCC bb | 3\nCc BB | 1\nCc Bb | 2\nCc bb | 3\ncc BB | 3\ncc Bb | 4\ncc bb | 4\n\nCounting:\n\nPhenotype 1: 2 birds\nPhenotype 2: 2 birds\nPhenotype 3: 3 birds\nPhenotype 4: 3 birds\n\nWait, that's 2+2+3+3=10 birds, but there are 16. This discrepancy suggests that my assumption about the number of birds per phenotype is incorrect. Instead, each phenotype should have a proportion based on the probabilities.\n\nWait, no\u2014since each bird is a unique individual, the actual count depends on how many genotypic combinations correspond to each phenotype. For instance, for Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n\n- Genotype CC BB: 1 bird\n- Genotype Cc BB: 1 bird\n- Genotype Cc Bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 3 birds\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n\n- CC Bb: 1 bird\n- Cc Bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 2 birds\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n\n- CC bb: 1 bird\n- cc BB: 1 bird\n- cc Bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 3 birds\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n\n- CC bb: 1 bird\n- cc BB: 1 bird\n- cc Bb: 1 bird\n- cc bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 4 birds\n\nWait, but this would imply that Phenotype 4 has 4 birds, which is higher than the others. However, according to the Punnett square, each genotype is represented once in the F2, except for the homozygous recessives which don't appear in the next generation if we're only considering F2 without selfing beyond the first generation. Wait, no\u2014the F2 includes all possible genotypes from the F1 selfing. So, each bird has a unique genotype, including homozygous ones.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach. The F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. Each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes, each with a 50% chance. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nAnd for the B alleles:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nCombined, the F2 genotypes include all combinations, each appearing once in the 16 birds. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Phenotype 4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 2 birds (CC BB and Cc BB)\n- Phenotype 2: 2 birds (CC Bb and Cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 3: 3 birds (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 4: 3 birds (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nAdding these up: 2+2+3+3=10, which is less than 16. I must be missing something. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including homozygous ones, which do express the phenotype. So, for Phenotype 1, it's CC BB, Cc BB, and Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014CC BB is one bird, Cc BB is another, and Cc Bb is another. Similarly, for Phenotype 2, CC Bb and Cc Bb. Wait, I'm still confused.\n\nPerhaps I should instead calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities. Since each trait is independent, the probability of each phenotype is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 for each phenotype. With 16 birds, each phenotype should have 4 birds. But that doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, I notice that option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16 birds, which matches the F2 size. How does this happen?\n\nIf each trait is independent, then:\n\n- Red (C) and Brown (B) together would have a 1:1 ratio among the phenotypes, assuming dominance allows for blending. However, in reality, each bird has both traits expressed, so the phenotypic ratio is determined by the independent assortment of the two traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I've been overcomplicating this. Let me try to count based on the F2 generation:\n\nEach bird's genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. For F2:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo, Phenotype 1 occurs 2 times (CC BB and Cc BB)\nPhenotype 2 occurs 2 times (CC Bb and Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 3 occurs 3 times (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\nPhenotype 4 occurs 3 times (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nThis totals 2+2+3+3=10, which is incorrect because there are 16 birds. This inconsistency suggests that my approach is flawed. Perhaps I should consider that the F2 includes all possible combinations without ignoring homozygotes. Wait, no, in F2, all genotypes are present, including homozygotes.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene has two possibilities, the phenotypic ratio would be 2x2=4, but considering dominance, some combinations might lead to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each bird has two traits:\n\n- Pigment color: C (red) or c (plain)\n- Body color: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nBut depending on dominance, some may overlap. For example, if both traits are expressed, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant. In this case, since the genes are separate, each trait is expressed independently. So the phenotypes are distinct unless certain conditions apply. But since each bird has two independent genes, the number of possible phenotypic categories is 2x2=4, but some may combine into fewer categories due to dominance. However, in this case, since each bird is characterized by both traits, and each trait is determined by a separate gene, the phenotypes would indeed be four distinct possibilities.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can use a Punnett square approach. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Let's consider the possible gametes from each parent:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB):\n- Can only give CB gametes because both alleles are dominant.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n- Can only give cb gametes because both alleles are recessive.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, resulting in CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- c_: Plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- b_: Checkered\n\nEach combination of these traits results in a unique phenotype. So the four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nWe need to determine how many of these phenotypes occur in the F2 generation.\n\nLet's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: C_b_ \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: c_B_ \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 4: c_b_ \u2192 25%\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for dominance properly because some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014if both traits are expressed, each phenotype is distinct. So, the distribution remains 25% for each phenotype.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of those traits. If both traits are expressed, the phenotype is determined by the combination. Since each gene acts independently, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for each phenotype. But wait, each bird has two traits, so the actual numbers would be:\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds (since 4 x 4).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red and Brown: 4 birds\n- Red and Checkered: 4 birds\n- Plain and Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 birds\n\nBut that's not accurate because the distribution isn't uniform across all combinations. Wait, no\u2014it's based on the independent assortment. Each gene assorts independently, so the phenotypic ratio should reflect the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014each trait is expressed independently. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. But looking at the options given, none of them have equal ratios. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOptions A through H list specific ratios like 6:2:6:2, which sum up to 16, matching the F2 size (4x4=16). So the correct option must show a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but none of the options seem to match that exactly. Wait, checking the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. That seems to fit because checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. Adding up to 16.\n\nAnother possibility is Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 9 \u2192 Also adds up to 16.\n\nBut according to our previous reasoning, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options directly state that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe the way the phenotypes are counted is different. Perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the plain color, which is determined by the recessive allele c. So, plain color could mean either checkered or something else. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that plain color is determined by c, so checkered is determined by b. So \"checkered\" implies the presence of the recessive allele, while \"plain\" is the dominant.\n\nIn terms of pigmentation, \"red\" is dominant (C), and \"brown\" is dominant (B). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nSince each trait is expressed independently, each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none provide such a ratio. Instead, all options have specific numbers adding up to 16. So perhaps the question expects us to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another approach: Using a Punnett square for F2. Let me construct it.\n\nParental cross: F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nThe F2 would come from F1 selfing, which results in the following:\n\nGametes from F1 (CcBb): CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%)\n\nF2 genotypes:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cB: Cc (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (25%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014this approach is confusing. Alternatively, the Punnett square for F2 would involve the combination of gametes from F1.\n\nAlternatively, since F1 is CcBb, F2 is generated by crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The Punnett square for this would be:\n\n          | C | c\n        -----------------\n        C     | CC | Cc\n        c      | Cc | cc\n\nSimilarly for B alleles:\n\n          | B | b\n        -----------------\n        B     | BB | Bb\n        b      | Bb | bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Cc BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each bird is characterized by both traits, so the correct way is:\n\n- CC BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Cc BB: Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): CC BB, Cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up the counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 2 birds (1 and 4)\n- Phenotype 2: 2 birds (2 and 5)\n- Phenotype 3: 3 birds (3,6,7)\n- Phenotype 4: 3 birds (8,9)\n\nWait, but that sums to 2+2+3+3=10, but there are 16 birds. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the F2 as a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a bird's genotype, then map to phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number based on the probabilities.\n\nGiven that each bird has four possible combinations of alleles, and each combination leads to a specific phenotype, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would be proportional to the number of each genotype.\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the cases. Since there are 16 birds, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But that contradicts the earlier counting.\n\nWait, no\u2014the Punnett square shows that each combination (like CC BB) occurs once in the 16 birds. So, the number of each phenotype should be based on how many genotypic combinations correspond to each phenotype.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n\nWait, that still doesn't add up correctly. Let me make a table:\n\nBird Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | 1\nCC Bb | 2\nCC bb | 3\nCc BB | 1\nCc Bb | 2\nCc bb | 3\ncc BB | 3\ncc Bb | 4\ncc bb | 4\n\nCounting:\n\nPhenotype 1: 2 birds\nPhenotype 2: 2 birds\nPhenotype 3: 3 birds\nPhenotype 4: 3 birds\n\nWait, that's 2+2+3+3=10 birds, but there are 16. This discrepancy suggests that my assumption about the number of birds per phenotype is incorrect. Instead, each phenotype should have a proportion based on the probabilities.\n\nWait, no\u2014since each bird is a unique individual, the actual count depends on how many genotypic combinations correspond to each phenotype. For instance, for Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n\n- Genotype CC BB: 1 bird\n- Genotype Cc BB: 1 bird\n- Genotype Cc Bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 3 birds\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n\n- CC Bb: 1 bird\n- Cc Bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 2 birds\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n\n- CC bb: 1 bird\n- cc BB: 1 bird\n- cc Bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 3 birds\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n\n- CC bb: 1 bird\n- cc BB: 1 bird\n- cc Bb: 1 bird\n- cc bb: 1 bird\nTotal: 4 birds\n\nWait, but this would imply that Phenotype 4 has 4 birds, which is higher than the others. However, according to the Punnett square, each genotype is represented once in the F2, except for the homozygous recessives which don't appear in the next generation if we're only considering F2 without selfing beyond the first generation. Wait, no\u2014the F2 includes all possible genotypes from the F1 selfing. So, each bird has a unique genotype, including homozygous ones.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach. The F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. Each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes, each with a 50% chance. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nAnd for the B alleles:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nCombined, the F2 genotypes include all combinations, each appearing once in the 16 birds. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Phenotype 4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 2 birds (CC BB and Cc BB)\n- Phenotype 2: 2 birds (CC Bb and Cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 3: 3 birds (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 4: 3 birds (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nAdding these up: 2+2+3+3=10, which is less than 16. I must be missing something. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including homozygous ones, which do express the phenotype. So, for Phenotype 1, it's CC BB, Cc BB, and Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014CC BB is one bird, Cc BB is another, and Cc Bb is another. Similarly, for Phenotype 2, CC Bb and Cc Bb. Wait, I'm still confused.\n\nPerhaps I should instead calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities. Since each trait is independent, the probability of each phenotype is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 for each phenotype. With 16 birds, each phenotype should have 4 birds. But that doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, I notice that option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16 birds, which matches the F2 size. How does this happen?\n\nIf each trait is independent, then:\n\n- Red (C) and Brown (B) together would have a 1:1 ratio among the phenotypes, assuming dominance allows for blending. However, in reality, each bird has both traits expressed, so the phenotypic ratio is determined by the independent assortment of the two traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I've been overcomplicating this. Let me try to count based on the F2 generation:\n\nEach bird's genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. For F2:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo, Phenotype 1 occurs 2 times (CC BB and Cc BB)\nPhenotype 2 occurs 2 times (CC Bb and Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 3 occurs 3 times (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\nPhenotype 4 occurs 3 times (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nThis totals 2+2+3+3=10, which is incorrect because there are 16 birds. This inconsistency suggests that my approach is flawed. Perhaps I should consider that the F2 includes all possible combinations without ignoring homozygotes. Wait, no, in F2, all genotypes are present, including homozygotes.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But since each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene, the number of phenotypic classes would be 2 x 2 = 4, assuming complete dominance and no epistasis.",
    "rollout": " But since each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene, the number of phenotypic classes would be 2 x 2 = 4, assuming complete dominance and no epistasis. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain red (c recessive, B recessive)\n4. Plain brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype. Since each bird has two independent genes, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor example, the probability of being Checkered red (C and B dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1/2 (since C is dominant, any C allele makes it dominant)\nP(B) = 1/2 (same reason)\nSo P(Checkered red) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive):\nP(C) = 1/2\nP(b) = 1/2\nP(Checkered brown) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain red (c recessive, B recessive):\nP(c) = 1/2\nP(B) = 1/2\nBut wait, since the bird must have both recessive alleles for the phenotype to appear. So P(Planain red) = P(c) * P(b) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because if a bird has the c allele (recessive) for pigment, then regardless of the color gene, it won't display the red pigment. Similarly, for the body color, if it has b (recessive), it won\u2019t display brown. So the presence of dominant alleles for both genes is required to express the phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B are dominant.\n   P(C) = 1/2\n   P(B) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered brown: C dominant, b recessive.\n   P(C) = 1/2\n   P(b) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n3. Plain red: c recessive, B recessive.\n   P(c) = 1/2\n   P(B) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n4. Plain brown: c recessive, B dominant.\n   P(c) = 1/2\n   P(B) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, that sums up to 1/4 each, totaling 1. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes aren't equally likely because of different genetic combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the actual gamete production. Let me try another approach. The F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (two types: Cc and Bb)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nEach type occurs with probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Can be either Checkered brown (if c is recessive and B dominant) or plain red (if c is dominant and B recessive). Wait, but no\u2014if C is dominant, it doesn't matter what B is, right? No, wait: If C is dominant, the bird will always have red pigment, regardless of the color gene. Similarly, if B is dominant, the bird will always have brown body color, regardless of the pigment gene. So in reality, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has the dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: Either C dominant and B dominant, or C dominant and B recessive, or c dominant and B dominant, or c dominant and B recessive. But since C and B are separate loci, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in the phenotype. So any bird with at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B will show the corresponding phenotype. \n\nWait, that complicates things. So the phenotypic expression isn't simply based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but rather, the bird will exhibit the phenotype corresponding to the combination of both genes. So for example, if a bird has C dominant and B dominant, it'll be Checkered red. If it has C dominant and B recessive, it'll be Checkered brown. If it has c dominant and B dominant, it'll be Plain red. And if it has c dominant and B recessive, it'll be Plain brown.\n\nGiven that, let's re-calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 This bird has either C dominant and B dominant (Checkered red) or C dominant and B recessive (Checkered brown) or c dominant and B dominant (Plain red) or c dominant and B recessive (Plain brown). Wait, no\u2014each bird has two independent genes. So the 50% CcBb actually represents all possible combinations where C is at least one dominant (so either C or c), and B is at least one dominant (either B or b). Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that CcBb means at least one C and at least one B. So:\n\nIn the 50% CcBb group:\n\n- Half have C dominant and B dominant: Checkered red\n- Half have C dominant and B recessive: Checkered brown\n- Half have c dominant and B dominant: Plain red\n- Half have c dominant and B recessive: Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that adds up to 25% + 25% + 25% + 25%, which equals 100%.\n\nWait, but no\u2014actually, the CcBb group includes all combinations where C is dominant (at least one C) and B is dominant (at least one B). So within the CcBb (50%), half will have C dominant and B dominant (Checkered red), and the other half will have C dominant and B recessive (Checkered brown), similarly for c dominant and B dominant (Plain red) and c dominant and B recessive (Plain brown).\n\nSo overall, the phenotypic distribution in F2 is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (from CC BB) + 25% (from CcBb) = 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from CcBb) \n- Plain red: 25% (from cb + cb) + 25% (from CcBb) = 50%\n- Plain brown: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up because 50% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 125%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nTotal F2 population:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 mix of Checkered red, brown, plain, etc.\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the breakdown. Let me structure it properly:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 mixed\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (25%) + CcBB (25%) \u2192 Total 50%\n- Checkered brown: Ccbb (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: ccBB (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: ccBb (25%) + ccbb (25%) \u2192 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean:\n\nCheckered red: 50%\nCheckered brown: 25%\nPlain red: 25%\nPlain brown: 50%\n\nThat adds up to 150%, which is impossible. I must have miscalculated. Let me recount:\n\nActually, each F2 generation has four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Checkered red (only from CC BB and CcBB)\n   - CC BB: 25%\n   - CcBB: 25%\n   Total: 50%\n\n2. Checkered brown (only from Ccbb)\n   - Ccbb: 25%\n\n3. Plain red (only from ccBB)\n   - ccBB: 25%\n\n4. Plain brown (from ccBb and ccbb)\n   - ccBb: 25%\n   - ccbb: 25%\n   Total: 50%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered red : 25% Checkered brown : 25% Plain red : 50% Plain brown\n\nWhich simplifies to 2:1:1:2 when expressed as parts.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 That's a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which corresponds to a dihybrid cross without dominance, i.e., treating each gene as independent but not necessarily expressing only when dominant.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0 \u2192 That implies all birds have either Checkered red or Checkered brown, and no Plain red or Brown, which contradicts our analysis.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit our 50:25:25:50 ratio.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 That's 6 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match our 50:25:25:50.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Not matching our 50:25:25:50.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, not matching.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Hmm, 8+4+0+4=16, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal numbers, which would correspond to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not our case.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to perfectly match my calculation. Option G was 12,2,2,0\u2192 which sums to 16, but our total is 100%, and the ratio is 50:25:25:50, which cannot be represented exactly in the options provided. Perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"phenotype ratios\" but does not specify whether it's the F2 generation. In the initial description, the user shows the F1 cross, but asks for F2. Also, the answer choices don't include 50:25:25:50, which suggests perhaps a different approach or I'm misunderstanding the dominance rules.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Let me confirm: - C is dominant over c, so pigment color (brown vs. checkered) is determined by C. - B is dominant over b, so body color (brown vs. checkered) is determined by B. So the phenotype is determined by both genes, with C and B being independent.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes remain Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown in a 50:25:25:50 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this exact ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, which doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nNone of them sum to 100. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that all phenotypes are expressed, but according to the dominance hierarchy, some may not be expressed. Wait, but in our previous analysis, all four phenotypes are expressed depending on the alleles.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the problem considers that if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses the corresponding phenotype. But in reality, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype. So, for example, having at least one C and at least one B would lead to Checkered red, regardless of whether they are dominant or recessive. Thus, in this case, all four phenotypes exist, leading to the 50:25:25:50 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore dominance and treat each gene separately, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each gene, hence option G.\n\nBut why would the user provide such options? Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy. The problem states: - C is dominant (red) and recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown) and recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, any bird with at least one dominant C will have red pigment, regardless of B. Any bird with at least one dominant B will have brown body color, regardless of C. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- At least one C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C and no B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B and no C \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive, their frequencies are additive. Given that, the frequencies would indeed be 50% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, and 25% Plain brown.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly represent this ratio. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, implying a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sums to 16, and in terms of squares, it looks like a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but that doesn't align with our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the number of birds with each phenotype, considering all possible combinations, including those where both genes are recessive. But according to our earlier analysis, the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to the phenotype. Therefore, the four phenotypes are correctly accounted for.\n\nGiven the options, none perfectly match the 50:25:25:50 ratio. However, Option G is the closest in terms of proportions, though it's a 1:1:1:1 ratio instead of 1:2:2:0 or similar. Since the problem might expect a different approach, perhaps the answer is Option G.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: If the problem is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to a particular phenotype, but not necessarily the combination. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant C, it will have red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B, it will have brown body color, regardless of C. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (100% if both are dominant)\n2. Only C dominant \u2192 Checkered brown (50%)\n3. Only B dominant \u2192 Plain red (50%)\n4. Neither dominant \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nWait, that changes everything. Let me reassess:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant C, it will have red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B, it will have brown body color, regardless of C. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red (100% of those who have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B)\n- If only C is present \u2192 Checkered brown (100% of those who have C dominant and B recessive)\n- If only B is present \u2192 Plain red (100% of those who have B dominant and C recessive)\n- If neither C nor B is present \u2192 Plain brown (100% of those who have neither dominant)\n\nThis completely alters the phenotype ratio. Now, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nThe F2 generation will have various combinations:\n\n1. All possible genotypes from F1 (CcBb) crossed with itself.\n\n2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. But since each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene, the number of phenotypic classes would be 2 x 2 = 4, assuming complete dominance and no epistasis. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain red (c recessive, B recessive)\n4. Plain brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype. Since each bird has two independent genes, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor example, the probability of being Checkered red (C and B dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1/2 (since C is dominant, any C allele makes it dominant)\nP(B) = 1/2 (same reason)\nSo P(Checkered red) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive):\nP(C) = 1/2\nP(b) = 1/2\nP(Checkered brown) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain red (c recessive, B recessive):\nP(c) = 1/2\nP(B) = 1/2\nBut wait, since the bird must have both recessive alleles for the phenotype to appear. So P(Planain red) = P(c) * P(b) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because if a bird has the c allele (recessive) for pigment, then regardless of the color gene, it won't display the red pigment. Similarly, for the body color, if it has b (recessive), it won\u2019t display brown. So the presence of dominant alleles for both genes is required to express the phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B are dominant.\n   P(C) = 1/2\n   P(B) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered brown: C dominant, b recessive.\n   P(C) = 1/2\n   P(b) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n3. Plain red: c recessive, B recessive.\n   P(c) = 1/2\n   P(B) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n4. Plain brown: c recessive, B dominant.\n   P(c) = 1/2\n   P(B) = 1/2\n   P(Both) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, that sums up to 1/4 each, totaling 1. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes aren't equally likely because of different genetic combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the actual gamete production. Let me try another approach. The F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (two types: Cc and Bb)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nEach type occurs with probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Can be either Checkered brown (if c is recessive and B dominant) or plain red (if c is dominant and B recessive). Wait, but no\u2014if C is dominant, it doesn't matter what B is, right? No, wait: If C is dominant, the bird will always have red pigment, regardless of the color gene. Similarly, if B is dominant, the bird will always have brown body color, regardless of the pigment gene. So in reality, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has the dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: Either C dominant and B dominant, or C dominant and B recessive, or c dominant and B dominant, or c dominant and B recessive. But since C and B are separate loci, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in the phenotype. So any bird with at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B will show the corresponding phenotype. \n\nWait, that complicates things. So the phenotypic expression isn't simply based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but rather, the bird will exhibit the phenotype corresponding to the combination of both genes. So for example, if a bird has C dominant and B dominant, it'll be Checkered red. If it has C dominant and B recessive, it'll be Checkered brown. If it has c dominant and B dominant, it'll be Plain red. And if it has c dominant and B recessive, it'll be Plain brown.\n\nGiven that, let's re-calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 This bird has either C dominant and B dominant (Checkered red) or C dominant and B recessive (Checkered brown) or c dominant and B dominant (Plain red) or c dominant and B recessive (Plain brown). Wait, no\u2014each bird has two independent genes. So the 50% CcBb actually represents all possible combinations where C is at least one dominant (so either C or c), and B is at least one dominant (either B or b). Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that CcBb means at least one C and at least one B. So:\n\nIn the 50% CcBb group:\n\n- Half have C dominant and B dominant: Checkered red\n- Half have C dominant and B recessive: Checkered brown\n- Half have c dominant and B dominant: Plain red\n- Half have c dominant and B recessive: Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that adds up to 25% + 25% + 25% + 25%, which equals 100%.\n\nWait, but no\u2014actually, the CcBb group includes all combinations where C is dominant (at least one C) and B is dominant (at least one B). So within the CcBb (50%), half will have C dominant and B dominant (Checkered red), and the other half will have C dominant and B recessive (Checkered brown), similarly for c dominant and B dominant (Plain red) and c dominant and B recessive (Plain brown).\n\nSo overall, the phenotypic distribution in F2 is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (from CC BB) + 25% (from CcBb) = 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from CcBb) \n- Plain red: 25% (from cb + cb) + 25% (from CcBb) = 50%\n- Plain brown: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up because 50% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 125%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nTotal F2 population:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 mix of Checkered red, brown, plain, etc.\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the breakdown. Let me structure it properly:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 mixed\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (25%) + CcBB (25%) \u2192 Total 50%\n- Checkered brown: Ccbb (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: ccBB (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: ccBb (25%) + ccbb (25%) \u2192 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean:\n\nCheckered red: 50%\nCheckered brown: 25%\nPlain red: 25%\nPlain brown: 50%\n\nThat adds up to 150%, which is impossible. I must have miscalculated. Let me recount:\n\nActually, each F2 generation has four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Checkered red (only from CC BB and CcBB)\n   - CC BB: 25%\n   - CcBB: 25%\n   Total: 50%\n\n2. Checkered brown (only from Ccbb)\n   - Ccbb: 25%\n\n3. Plain red (only from ccBB)\n   - ccBB: 25%\n\n4. Plain brown (from ccBb and ccbb)\n   - ccBb: 25%\n   - ccbb: 25%\n   Total: 50%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered red : 25% Checkered brown : 25% Plain red : 50% Plain brown\n\nWhich simplifies to 2:1:1:2 when expressed as parts.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 That's a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which corresponds to a dihybrid cross without dominance, i.e., treating each gene as independent but not necessarily expressing only when dominant.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0 \u2192 That implies all birds have either Checkered red or Checkered brown, and no Plain red or Brown, which contradicts our analysis.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit our 50:25:25:50 ratio.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 That's 6 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match our 50:25:25:50.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Not matching our 50:25:25:50.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, not matching.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Hmm, 8+4+0+4=16, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal numbers, which would correspond to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not our case.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to perfectly match my calculation. Option G was 12,2,2,0\u2192 which sums to 16, but our total is 100%, and the ratio is 50:25:25:50, which cannot be represented exactly in the options provided. Perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"phenotype ratios\" but does not specify whether it's the F2 generation. In the initial description, the user shows the F1 cross, but asks for F2. Also, the answer choices don't include 50:25:25:50, which suggests perhaps a different approach or I'm misunderstanding the dominance rules.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Let me confirm: - C is dominant over c, so pigment color (brown vs. checkered) is determined by C. - B is dominant over b, so body color (brown vs. checkered) is determined by B. So the phenotype is determined by both genes, with C and B being independent.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes remain Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown in a 50:25:25:50 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this exact ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, which doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nNone of them sum to 100. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that all phenotypes are expressed, but according to the dominance hierarchy, some may not be expressed. Wait, but in our previous analysis, all four phenotypes are expressed depending on the alleles.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the problem considers that if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses the corresponding phenotype. But in reality, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype. So, for example, having at least one C and at least one B would lead to Checkered red, regardless of whether they are dominant or recessive. Thus, in this case, all four phenotypes exist, leading to the 50:25:25:50 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore dominance and treat each gene separately, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each gene, hence option G.\n\nBut why would the user provide such options? Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy. The problem states: - C is dominant (red) and recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown) and recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, any bird with at least one dominant C will have red pigment, regardless of B. Any bird with at least one dominant B will have brown body color, regardless of C. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- At least one C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C and no B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B and no C \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive, their frequencies are additive. Given that, the frequencies would indeed be 50% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, and 25% Plain brown.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly represent this ratio. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, implying a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sums to 16, and in terms of squares, it looks like a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but that doesn't align with our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the number of birds with each phenotype, considering all possible combinations, including those where both genes are recessive. But according to our earlier analysis, the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to the phenotype. Therefore, the four phenotypes are correctly accounted for.\n\nGiven the options, none perfectly match the 50:25:25:50 ratio. However, Option G is the closest in terms of proportions, though it's a 1:1:1:1 ratio instead of 1:2:2:0 or similar. Since the problem might expect a different approach, perhaps the answer is Option G.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: If the problem is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to a particular phenotype, but not necessarily the combination. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant C, it will have red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B, it will have brown body color, regardless of C. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (100% if both are dominant)\n2. Only C dominant \u2192 Checkered brown (50%)\n3. Only B dominant \u2192 Plain red (50%)\n4. Neither dominant \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nWait, that changes everything. Let me reassess:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant C, it will have red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B, it will have brown body color, regardless of C. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red (100% of those who have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B)\n- If only C is present \u2192 Checkered brown (100% of those who have C dominant and B recessive)\n- If only B is present \u2192 Plain red (100% of those who have B dominant and C recessive)\n- If neither C nor B is present \u2192 Plain brown (100% of those who have neither dominant)\n\nThis completely alters the phenotype ratio. Now, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nThe F2 generation will have various combinations:\n\n1. All possible genotypes from F1 (CcBb) crossed with itself.\n\n2. Calculating the probabilities of each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBB: 25% (since Cc and BB)\n- CcBb: ",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's list them:",
    "rollout": " Let's list them:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and body checkered (C_bb)\n- Pigment plain and body brown (cc_B_)\n- Pigment plain and body checkered (cccc)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present): C_B_\n2. Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (B absent): C_bb\n3. Pigment plain (C absent) and body brown (B present): cc_B_\n4. Pigment plain (C absent) and body checkered (B absent): cc_bb\n\nSo, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. Now, to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2, we need to calculate how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nSince the F2 generation results from a dihybrid cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), we can use a Punnett square to determine the distribution. The possible phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Present (C): 3/4 of the time\n  - Absent (c): 1/4 of the time\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - Present (B): 3/4 of the time\n  - Absent (b): 1/4 of the time\n\nBut since the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Pigment red and body checkered (C_bb):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. Pigment plain and body brown (cc_B_):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered (cc_bb):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown. Wait, but looking back at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that the F2 generation will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. Using a Punnett square, each parent contributes four types of gametes (since it's a dihybrid cross), but since both parents are heterozygous (CcBB and ccbb?), no, wait, the parents are CcBB and ccbb, but that's a typo. Let me clarify: The parents are CcBB and ccbb? Or is it CcBB and ccbb? Actually, the parents are CcBB (heterozygous for both genes) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes).\n\nWhen these two parents self, the F2 generation will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. To find the phenotypes, we'll look at each gene separately and then combine them. \n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- \u00be chance of having at least one dominant C (red)\n- \u00bc chance of being cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- \u00be chance of having at least one dominant B (brown)\n- \u00bc chance of being bb (checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. C_B_: red, brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_bb: red, checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc_B_: plain, brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc_bb: plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the number of individuals in each phenotype depends on the probabilities:\n\n- For Checkered red (C_B_), the probability is (\u00be)(\u00be) = 9/16 \u2192 9 individuals\n- For Checkered brown (C_bb), it's (\u00be)(\u00bc) = 3/16 \u2192 3 individuals\n- For Plain red (cc_B_), it's (\u00bc)(\u00be) = 3/16 \u2192 3 individuals\n- For Plain brown (cc_bb), it's (\u00bc)(\u00bc) = 1/16 \u2192 1 individual\n\nAdding up, 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation.\n\nAnother option, Option G, states: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16, not matching any of those.\n\nSimilarly, Option J suggests checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list them:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and body checkered (C_bb)\n- Pigment plain and body brown (cc_B_)\n- Pigment plain and body checkered (cccc)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present): C_B_\n2. Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (B absent): C_bb\n3. Pigment plain (C absent) and body brown (B present): cc_B_\n4. Pigment plain (C absent) and body checkered (B absent): cc_bb\n\nSo, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. Now, to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2, we need to calculate how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nSince the F2 generation results from a dihybrid cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), we can use a Punnett square to determine the distribution. The possible phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Present (C): 3/4 of the time\n  - Absent (c): 1/4 of the time\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - Present (B): 3/4 of the time\n  - Absent (b): 1/4 of the time\n\nBut since the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Pigment red and body checkered (C_bb):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. Pigment plain and body brown (cc_B_):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered (cc_bb):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown. Wait, but looking back at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that the F2 generation will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. Using a Punnett square, each parent contributes four types of gametes (since it's a dihybrid cross), but since both parents are heterozygous (CcBB and ccbb?), no, wait, the parents are CcBB and ccbb, but that's a typo. Let me clarify: The parents are CcBB and ccbb? Or is it CcBB and ccbb? Actually, the parents are CcBB (heterozygous for both genes) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes).\n\nWhen these two parents self, the F2 generation will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. To find the phenotypes, we'll look at each gene separately and then combine them. \n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- \u00be chance of having at least one dominant C (red)\n- \u00bc chance of being cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- \u00be chance of having at least one dominant B (brown)\n- \u00bc chance of being bb (checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. C_B_: red, brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_bb: red, checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc_B_: plain, brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc_bb: plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the number of individuals in each phenotype depends on the probabilities:\n\n- For Checkered red (C_B_), the probability is (\u00be)(\u00be) = 9/16 \u2192 9 individuals\n- For Checkered brown (C_bb), it's (\u00be)(\u00bc) = 3/16 \u2192 3 individuals\n- For Plain red (cc_B_), it's (\u00bc)(\u00be) = 3/16 \u2192 3 individuals\n- For Plain brown (cc_bb), it's (\u00bc)(\u00bc) = 1/16 \u2192 1 individual\n\nAdding up, 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation.\n\nAnother option, Option G, states: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16, not matching any of those.\n\nSimilarly, Option J suggests checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C/B status.",
    "rollout": " So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C/B status. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nWait, but in reality, the dominant allele determines the phenotype, so:\n\n- Pigment color: C (red) or c (plain)\n- Body color: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, we need to determine how often each phenotype appears in the F2 generation. Since both genes are being crossed, and each gene is independent, the ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus. In the F2 generation, the proportion of individuals with the dominant allele (C) is 3/4 (since C can be present in 3/4 of the cases: CC, Cc, and 3/4 of CcBb). Similarly, the proportion without C (cc) is 1/4. \n\nFor the B locus, similarly, the proportion with B (B_) is 3/4 (since B can be present in 3/4 of the cases: BB, Bb, and 3/4 of BbBb). And the proportion without B (bb) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability C is present (C_: 3/4)\n   - Probability B is present (B_: 3/4)\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb):\n   - Probability C is present (3/4)\n   - Probability B is absent (1/4)\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_):\n   - Probability c is present (1/4)\n   - Probability B is present (3/4)\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb):\n   - Probability c is present (1/4)\n   - Probability B is absent (1/4)\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nBut wait, this doesn't add up because 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 equals 16/16, which checks out. Now, translating these fractions into actual counts, assuming 16 flies in the F2 generation:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nThis corresponds to option G, which states: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined differently. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, another approach: Each bird has two traits, so the four phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The order might matter, but typically, we list them in terms of dominant traits first. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nWhich aligns with what I did before. So according to my calculations, the F2 generation would have 9 Red Brown, 3 Red Checkered, 3 Plain Brown, and 1 Plain Checkered. Looking back at the options, none exactly match this. Let me review the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches my calculation.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\nOption G:12,2,2,6 \u2192 No, seems higher than our count.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption K:4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\nOption L: Wait, looking back, the options given are labeled A to L, but the user didn't specify whether they're numbered or if some are missing. Wait, the original question lists options from A to H, but the user shows options starting from A to J, then G, etc. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, another way: Perhaps the initial setup was different. The parents were CC BB and cc bb. So in the F1, all would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. As each gene is independent, the F2 will have 16 genotypes: 4 for each gene (CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb). But considering dominance, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me create a Punnett square for F2:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, it can produce CB and cb gametes. So in F2, the gametes would be 50% CB and 50% cb. Therefore, the F2 genotype combinations would be:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB x cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb x CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb x cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, each parent contributes either CB or cb, so F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, considering the B locus: If an individual has CB, their B phenotype is brown; if they have cb, their B phenotype is checkered. Similarly, for C: CB is red, cb is plain.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CcB_: 75% (3/4 C, 3/4 B)\n2. Ccbb: 25% (3/4 C, 1/4 b)\n3. ccB_: 25% (1/4 C, 3/4 B)\n4. ccbb: 25% (1/4 C, 1/4 b)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypic ratios:\n\n- CcB_: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Red Brown (9)\n- Ccbb: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Red Checkered (3)\n- ccB_: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Brown (3)\n- ccbb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Checkered (1)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to option G. So the answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Wait, the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with different phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (probability 25%)\n- CC bb (probability 25%)\n- CC bb (same as above?)\nWait, no, let me recast this properly. Each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal numbers. So when F1 \u00d7 F1, the possible gametes are CB and cb each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CC Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CC Bb (another 25%, so total 50%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = CC bb (25%)\n\nSimilarly, looking at B locus:\n\nEach F1 produces gametes B and b.

Same for the B gene (B and b). Thus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles received from each parent.\n\nSo for the C gene:\n\n- 25% CC (p)\n- 25% Cc (p)\n- 25% cc (q)\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- 25% BB (B)\n- 25% Bb (B)\n- 25% bb (b)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. C (p) and B (B): Checkered Brown\n2. C (p) and B (b): Checkered Checkered\n3. C (p) and b (B): Checkered Brown\n4. C (p) and b (b): Checkered Red\n5.

C (q) and b (b): Plain Red\n9. cc (q) and bb (b): Plain Red\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into similar phenotypes. Specifically, if a bird has both C (p) and B (B), it's Checkered Brown. If it has C (p) and b (b), it's Checkered Red. If it has c (q) and B (B), it's Plain Brown. And if it has c (q) and b (b), it's Plain Red. Also, the presence of both C and B leads to Checkered Brown, and the presence of C and b leads to Checkered Red. Similarly, the presence of c and B leads to Plain Brown, and c and b leads to Plain Red. Additionally, within the C gene, if it's C (p), regardless of the B gene, it's Checkered. If it's cc (q), then it's Plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (CpB)\n- Checkered Red (CpB)\n- Checkered Red (Cp)\n- Checkered Red (cB)\n- Checkered Brown (Cp)\n- Checkered Brown (cB)\n- Checkered Red (cB)\n- Checkered Red (c)\n- Plain Brown (cB)\n- Plain Brown (c)\n- Plain Red (c)\n- Plain Red (c)\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe a better way is to consider each bird's phenotype based on whether it has any dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the genotypes. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence of C (red): probability 3/4 (since only cc is recessive)\n- Absence of C (plain): probability 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence of B (brown): probability 3/4\n- Absence of B (checkered): probability 1/4\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are present: Checkered Brown\n- Both C and B absent: Plain Red\n- Only C present: Checkered Red\n- Only B present: Checkered Brown\n- Only C absent: Plain Red\n- Only B absent: Plain Brown\n\nBut wait, this might not capture all cases correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C and B):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Checkered Red (C and not B):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain Red (not C and B):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain Brown (not C and not B):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this approach because sometimes the interaction between genes isn't additive like this. Another way is to look at each gene separately and then combine their effects.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- 3/4 chance of having C (p) leading to Checkered (any B)\n- 1/4 chance of having cc (q) leading to Plain (any B)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- 3/4 chance of having B (B) leading to Brown\n- 1/4 chance of having b (b) leading to Checkered\n\nSo the overall phenotype is determined by the combination of these. So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, where each represents the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 Checkered Brown : 3 Checkered Red : 3 Plain Red : 1 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, pigment color is determined by C (red) and c (plain), while body color is B (brown) and b (checkered). So the phenotype depends on both. If a bird has C (p pigment) and B (brown), it'll be Checkered Brown. If it has C (p) and b (checkered), it'll be Checkered Red. Similarly, if it has c (no p) and B (brown), it'll be Plain Brown. If it has c (no p) and b (no checkered), it'll be Plain Red. So the phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nNow, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio would depend on the number of each type of genotype. From earlier, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n- CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, correction: The F2 genotypes are:\n\nLooking back, the F2 would consist of four genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CC bb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Brown)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc bb (Again, same as above?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with different phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (probability 25%)\n- CC bb (probability 25%)\n- CC bb (same as above?)\nWait, no, let me recast this properly. Each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal numbers. So when F1 \u00d7 F1, the possible gametes are CB and cb each at 50%.

Wait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so for each gene, the F1 has a 50% chance of contributing either allele. So for the C gene (p and q alleles), each F1 gamete has a 50% chance of being C or c. Same for the B gene (B and b). Thus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles received from each parent.\n\nSo for the C gene:\n\n- 25% CC (p)\n- 25% Cc (p)\n- 25% cc (q)\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- 25% BB (B)\n- 25% Bb (B)\n- 25% bb (b)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. C (p) and B (B): Checkered Brown\n2. C (p) and B (b): Checkered Checkered\n3. C (p) and b (B): Checkered Brown\n4. C (p) and b (b): Checkered Red\n5. C (q) and B (B): Plain Brown\n6. C (q) and B (b): Plain Brown\n7. C (q) and b (B): Plain Checkered\n8. C (q) and b (b): Plain Red\n9. cc (q) and bb (b): Plain Red\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into similar phenotypes. Specifically, if a bird has both C (p) and B (B), it's Checkered Brown. If it has C (p) and b (b), it's Checkered Red. If it has c (q) and B (B), it's Plain Brown. And if it has c (q) and b (b), it's Plain Red. Also, the presence of both C and B leads to Checkered Brown, and the presence of C and b leads to Checkered Red. Similarly, the presence of c and B leads to Plain Brown, and c and b leads to Plain Red. Additionally, within the C gene, if it's C (p), regardless of the B gene, it's Checkered. If it's cc (q), then it's Plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (CpB)\n- Checkered Red (CpB)\n- Checkered Red (Cp)\n- Checkered Red (cB)\n- Checkered Brown (Cp)\n- Checkered Brown (cB)\n- Checkered Red (cB)\n- Checkered Red (c)\n- Plain Brown (cB)\n- Plain Brown (c)\n- Plain Red (c)\n- Plain Red (c)\n\nWait, this seems complicated.

But in reality, with dominance, each gene contributes one of two possible phenotypes.

The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as previously stated.

Wait, but no\u2014each parent can only contribute either CB or cb, so the F2 would have four combinations: CC (CB + CB), Cc (CB + cb), cc (cb + cb), and bb (cb + cb).\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Now, determining the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n- CC: pigment (C) is dominant \u2192 red\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: checkered red\n- Cc: pigment (C) dominant \u2192 red\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: checkered brown\n- cc: pigment (c) \u2192 plain\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: plain brown\n- bb: pigment (c) \u2192 plain\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: plain brown\n\nWait, but wait\u2014if both genes are recessive, the bird would be plain (for pigment) and plain brown (for body color)? Or does the body color take precedence over the pigment color?\n\nIn this case, the presence of any dominant allele for a gene overrides the recessive. So if a bird is cc (no pigment) and bb (no body color), it's plain brown. If a bird is cc (no pigment) but has B (brown body), it remains plain brown. Similarly, if it's cc (no pigment) but has b (checkered), it becomes plain checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (pigment red, body brown)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (pigment red, body brown)\n3. Plain red: cc (pigment plain, body brown)\n4. Plain brown: bb (pigment plain, body brown)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously. So if a bird has both recessive alleles, it's plain brown. If it has one dominant, it's the dominant phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird is CC (pigment red, body brown): Checkered red\n- If a bird is Cc (pigment red, body brown): Checkered brown\n- If a bird is cc (pigment plain, body brown): Plain red\n- If a bird is bb (pigment plain, body brown): Plain brown\n\nSo now, we need to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nSince F2 comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, and F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (assuming random assortment), the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C and C)\n- 50% Cc (half from CB and half from cb)\n- 25% cc (all c and c)\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- 25% CC: Checkered red\n- 50% Cc: Checkered brown\n- 25% cc: Plain red\n- 25% bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, and 25% Plain brown. Adding up the percentages: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, which makes sense because the sum must be 100%.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide different ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. These suggest different ratios where some phenotypes don't appear. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that the genes are linked, but the problem doesn't state anything about linkage. Also, without knowing the coefficient of dominance or the exact interaction between the genes, it's hard to apply the standard Mendelian ratios. However, in this problem, each bird has two separate genes, so the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of both genes' effects.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem assumes that each gene acts independently, leading to four phenotypic classes, each occurring at a certain frequency based on the segregation of the genes. Given that, the phenotypic ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, and 25% Plain brown. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16 parts, which isn't 100%, so likely incorrect.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, which also doesn't add up.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Not matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Sum is 16. Still not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, missing others.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 16. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present, not necessarily both. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of animals rather than percentages. Let me try another approach.\n\nIf the F2 generation consists of 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds, according to option G, but that sums to 16, which is less than 100%. So perhaps the question expects the ratios in terms of numbers, not percentages. Let's see:\n\nAssuming F2 has 16 birds, the options would scale accordingly. Option G states 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. Summing to 16, but plain brown is zero, which doesn't make sense unless some phenotypes aren't observed.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, perhaps the checkered brown and plain brown aren't both present. Maybe brown is dominant over checkered, so a bird with at least one B allele would display brown, regardless of the c allele. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (no B)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (no B)\n3. Plain red: cc (any B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (but if B is dominant, then any B allele leads to brown)\n\nWait, but if B is dominant, then any presence of B would make the bird brown, even if c is present. So the phenotypes become:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (no B, no c)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (no B, but has B)\n3. Plain red: cc (has c, but has B?)\nNo, wait: Brown is dominant over checkered, so any bird with at least one B allele would be brown, regardless of c. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (no B, no c)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (no B, but has B)\n3. Plain red: cc (has c, but may have B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (has B, regardless of c)\n\nWait, but that changes the phenotypic ratios. Now, considering dominance, the presence of B would override the effect of c. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has B or not, with C and c being irrelevant once B is present.\n\nThus, the F2 generation would have four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (all have neither B nor c)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (all have B but no c)\n3. Plain red: cc (all have c but may have B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (all have B, regardless of c)\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportions:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (no B, no c)\n- 50% Cc (no B, but B present)\n- 25% cc (with c, but B present)\n- 25% bb (with B present)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% Checkered red (CC)\n- 50% Checkered brown (Cc)\n- 25% Plain red (cc)\n- 25% Plain brown (bb)\n\nAdding up to 100%, the ratios are 25:50:25:25. Now, looking at the answer choices, none directly match this. However, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the non-plurality cases, i.e., excluding checkered red and plain red, which would be 50:25, but that's not the phrasing.\n\nLooking back, the options provided include:\n\n- Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum 16\n- Option E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16\n- Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n- Option G:12,2,2,0\u2192sum16\n- Option H:5,3,2,6\u2192sum16\n\nNone of these seem to fit the 25:50:25:25 ratio. Perhaps the question intended to count the number of each phenotype type, assuming that all phenotypes are present, but that's impossible since some phenotypes won't occur together. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the genetic model.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different notation where \"checkered\" refers to the recessive allele, and \"plain\" refers to the dominant. So, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (both recessive)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (recessive B)\n- Plain red: cc (recessive B)\n- Plain brown: bb (any B)\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratios would still be 25% each, except that the names might change. But the options don't align with this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the ratio of the checkered and plain for each trait separately.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So perhaps I should compute the actual counts based on the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that F2 has 16 birds (assuming 16 for simplicity), the expected counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 16 \u00d7 25% = 4\n- Checkered brown: 16 \u00d7 50% = 8\n- Plain red: 16 \u00d7 25% = 4\n- Plain brown: 16 \u00d7 25% = 4\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\n- Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum16\n- Option E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum16\n- Option F:4,4,4,4\u2192sum16\n- Option G:12,2,2,0\u2192sum16\n- Option H:5,3,2,6\u2192sum16\n\nThese all have sums of 16. None of them seems to match my expectation of 4,8,4,4. However, perhaps the question is counting only the checkered and plain for each trait, ignoring dominance, or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of each gene's effect, treating each bird as having a binary phenotype for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the presence of a dominant allele for a trait overrides the recessive, but only applies to one gene at a time. For example, the presence of B overrides the recessive for B, and similarly for C. Thus, the phenotypes would be determined by whether each gene is present.\n\nWait, in that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: checkered red\n2. Checkered red (C dominant) and brown (B present)\n3. Plain red (C recessive) and brown (B present)\n4. Checkered brown (B dominant) and plain (C recessive)\n5. Checkered brown (B dominant) and brown (B dominant)\n6. Plain brown (B recessive) and brown (B dominant)\n7. Plain brown (B recessive) and plain (C recessive)\n8. Plain brown (B recessive) and brown (B dominant)\n\nWait, but that complicates things further. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So, if a bird has either C or B, it displays the associated trait. Otherwise, it displays the default trait (which is neither C nor B, but since both genes are required for any trait, perhaps all default to something else, but the problem doesn't specify.)\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me go back to the original problem statement and ensure I understood it correctly. The checkered bird is homozygous for the recessive allele c, and the plain bird is homozygous for the dominant allele B. Wait, hold on! The problem says:\n\n- Checkered bird: homozygous recessive for c (so cc)\n- Plain bird: homozygous dominant for B (BB)\n\nAnd the other parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant for both genes\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive for both genes\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the result of selfing F1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought F1 was CcBb, but now I realize that if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 would be CcBb, right? Because F1 receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the C locus, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the B locus.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs, resulting in F2. As before, F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb.\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n- Cc: checkered brown (C dominant, B present)\n- cc: plain red (no B, but B present)\n- bb: plain brown (no B, but B present)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Plain red\n4. Plain brown\n\nThe frequencies would be 25% each, so in a population of 16 birds:\n\n- 4 checkered red\n- 8 checkered brown\n- 4 plain red\n- 4 plain brown\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Looking at the options:\n\n- Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum16\n\nThat matches the 25% each for each phenotype when scaled to 16. So perhaps the answer is F. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If each phenotype is equally represented, then F:4:4:4:4 would be the ratio. But the options have F labeled as 4,4,4,4, which corresponds to this scenario.\n\nBut looking back at the initial problem statement, the options are presented differently. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nOptions A-G are all different ratios. Option F is 4,4,4,4. So perhaps the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene is independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios for each gene are 1:1:1. Wait, no\u2014that's for three options. Here, each gene has two options (dominant or recessive), leading to three phenotypic categories for each trait? No, wait, each gene has three phenotypic expressions if dominance is complete. But in reality, with dominance, each gene contributes one of two possible phenotypes. So for each trait, two phenotypes: dominant and recessive.\n\nWait, but for our purposes, each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. Each trait has two phenotypes (dominant and recessive). So the total number of phenotypic classes would be 2\u00d72=4. However, some combinations may overlap. For example, a bird could be both red and brown if both genes are dominant. Similarly, a bird could be plain and checkered if both are recessive. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: plain red\n4. Both recessive: plain brown\n\nNow, to determine the frequency of each class, we consider the probabilities for each gene. Since each gene is independent, the probability for each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (red): 1 (since it's dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain): 0 (since it's recessive)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the dominant allele is always expressed regardless of its position. In reality, with dihybrids, the phenotypic ratios are often 9:3:3:1, but that applies when each gene is completely dominant and follows Mendel's laws. However, in this case, the dominance might not follow the typical ratios because of the specific alleles given. Let me double-check the problem statement:\n\n- C: dominant pigment (red), recessive c (plain)\n- B: dominant body color (brown), recessive b (checkered)\n\nEach bird has two genes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as previously stated. The F2 would then be the result of selfing F1, producing four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but no\u2014each parent can only contribute either CB or cb, so the F2 would have four combinations: CC (CB + CB), Cc (CB + cb), cc (cb + cb), and bb (cb + cb).\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Now, determining the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n- CC: pigment (C) is dominant \u2192 red\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: checkered red\n- Cc: pigment (C) dominant \u2192 red\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: checkered brown\n- cc: pigment (c) \u2192 plain\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: plain brown\n- bb: pigment (c) \u2192 plain\n   - B: brown \u2192 brown\n   - So phenotype: plain brown\n\nWait, but wait\u2014if both genes are recessive, the bird would be plain (for pigment) and plain brown (for body color)? Or does the body color take precedence over the pigment color?\n\nIn this case, the presence of any dominant allele for a gene overrides the recessive. So if a bird is cc (no pigment) and bb (no body color), it's plain brown. If a bird is cc (no pigment) but has B (brown body), it remains plain brown. Similarly, if it's cc (no pigment) but has b (checkered), it becomes plain checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (pigment red, body brown)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (pigment red, body brown)\n3. Plain red: cc (pigment plain, body brown)\n4. Plain brown: bb (pigment plain, body brown)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously. So if a bird has both recessive alleles, it's plain brown. If it has one dominant, it's the dominant phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird is CC (pigment red, body brown): Checkered red\n- If a bird is Cc (pigment red, body brown): Checkered brown\n- If a bird is cc (pigment plain, body brown): Plain red\n- If a bird is bb (pigment plain, body brown): Plain brown\n\nSo now, we need to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nSince F2 comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, and F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (assuming random assortment), the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C and C)\n- 50% Cc (half from CB and half from cb)\n- 25% cc (all c and c)\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- 25% CC: Checkered red\n- 50% Cc: Checkered brown\n- 25% cc: Plain red\n- 25% bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, and 25% Plain brown. Adding up the percentages: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, which makes sense because the sum must be 100%.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide different ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. These suggest different ratios where some phenotypes don't appear. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that the genes are linked, but the problem doesn't state anything about linkage. Also, without knowing the coefficient of dominance or the exact interaction between the genes, it's hard to apply the standard Mendelian ratios. However, in this problem, each bird has two separate genes, so the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of both genes' effects.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem assumes that each gene acts independently, leading to four phenotypic classes, each occurring at a certain frequency based on the segregation of the genes. Given that, the phenotypic ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, and 25% Plain brown. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16 parts, which isn't 100%, so likely incorrect.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, which also doesn't add up.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Not matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Sum is 16. Still not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, missing others.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 16. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present, not necessarily both. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of animals rather than percentages. Let me try another approach.\n\nIf the F2 generation consists of 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds, according to option G, but that sums to 16, which is less than 100%. So perhaps the question expects the ratios in terms of numbers, not percentages. Let's see:\n\nAssuming F2 has 16 birds, the options would scale accordingly. Option G states 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. Summing to 16, but plain brown is zero, which doesn't make sense unless some phenotypes aren't observed.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, perhaps the checkered brown and plain brown aren't both present. Maybe brown is dominant over checkered, so a bird with at least one B allele would display brown, regardless of the c allele. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (no B)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (no B)\n3. Plain red: cc (any B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (but if B is dominant, then any B allele leads to brown)\n\nWait, but if B is dominant, then any presence of B would make the bird brown, even if c is present. So the phenotypes become:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (no B, no c)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (no B, but has B)\n3. Plain red: cc (has c, but has B?)\nNo, wait: Brown is dominant over checkered, so any bird with at least one B allele would be brown, regardless of c. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (no B, no c)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (no B, but has B)\n3. Plain red: cc (has c, but may have B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (has B, regardless of c)\n\nWait, but that changes the phenotypic ratios. Now, considering dominance, the presence of B would override the effect of c. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has B or not, with C and c being irrelevant once B is present.\n\nThus, the F2 generation would have four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (all have neither B nor c)\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (all have B but no c)\n3. Plain red: cc (all have c but may have B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (all have B, regardless of c)\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportions:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (no B, no c)\n- 50% Cc (no B, but B present)\n- 25% cc (with c, but B present)\n- 25% bb (with B present)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% Checkered red (CC)\n- 50% Checkered brown (Cc)\n- 25% Plain red (cc)\n- 25% Plain brown (bb)\n\nAdding up to 100%, the ratios are 25:50:25:25. Now, looking at the answer choices, none directly match this. However, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the non-plurality cases, i.e., excluding checkered red and plain red, which would be 50:25, but that's not the phrasing.\n\nLooking back, the options provided include:\n\n- Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum 16\n- Option E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16\n- Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n- Option G:12,2,2,0\u2192sum16\n- Option H:5,3,2,6\u2192sum16\n\nNone of these seem to fit the 25:50:25:25 ratio. Perhaps the question intended to count the number of each phenotype type, assuming that all phenotypes are present, but that's impossible since some phenotypes won't occur together. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the genetic model.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different notation where \"checkered\" refers to the recessive allele, and \"plain\" refers to the dominant. So, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (both recessive)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (recessive B)\n- Plain red: cc (recessive B)\n- Plain brown: bb (any B)\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratios would still be 25% each, except that the names might change. But the options don't align with this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the ratio of the checkered and plain for each trait separately.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So perhaps I should compute the actual counts based on the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that F2 has 16 birds (assuming 16 for simplicity), the expected counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 16 \u00d7 25% = 4\n- Checkered brown: 16 \u00d7 50% = 8\n- Plain red: 16 \u00d7 25% = 4\n- Plain brown: 16 \u00d7 25% = 4\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\n- Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum16\n- Option E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum16\n- Option F:4,4,4,4\u2192sum16\n- Option G:12,2,2,0\u2192sum16\n- Option H:5,3,2,6\u2192sum16\n\nThese all have sums of 16. None of them seems to match my expectation of 4,8,4,4. However, perhaps the question is counting only the checkered and plain for each trait, ignoring dominance, or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of each gene's effect, treating each bird as having a binary phenotype for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the presence of a dominant allele for a trait overrides the recessive, but only applies to one gene at a time. For example, the presence of B overrides the recessive for B, and similarly for C. Thus, the phenotypes would be determined by whether each gene is present.\n\nWait, in that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: checkered red\n2. Checkered red (C dominant) and brown (B present)\n3. Plain red (C recessive) and brown (B present)\n4. Checkered brown (B dominant) and plain (C recessive)\n5. Checkered brown (B dominant) and brown (B dominant)\n6. Plain brown (B recessive) and brown (B dominant)\n7. Plain brown (B recessive) and plain (C recessive)\n8. Plain brown (B recessive) and brown (B dominant)\n\nWait, but that complicates things further. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So, if a bird has either C or B, it displays the associated trait. Otherwise, it displays the default trait (which is neither C nor B, but since both genes are required for any trait, perhaps all default to something else, but the problem doesn't specify.)\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me go back to the original problem statement and ensure I understood it correctly. The checkered bird is homozygous for the recessive allele c, and the plain bird is homozygous for the dominant allele B. Wait, hold on! The problem says:\n\n- Checkered bird: homozygous recessive for c (so cc)\n- Plain bird: homozygous dominant for B (BB)\n\nAnd the other parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant for both genes\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive for both genes\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the result of selfing F1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought F1 was CcBb, but now I realize that if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 would be CcBb, right? Because F1 receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the C locus, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the B locus.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs, resulting in F2. As before, F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb.\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n- Cc: checkered brown (C dominant, B present)\n- cc: plain red (no B, but B present)\n- bb: plain brown (no B, but B present)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Plain red\n4. Plain brown\n\nThe frequencies would be 25% each, so in a population of 16 birds:\n\n- 4 checkered red\n- 8 checkered brown\n- 4 plain red\n- 4 plain brown\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Looking at the options:\n\n- Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum16\n\nThat matches the 25% each for each phenotype when scaled to 16. So perhaps the answer is F. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If each phenotype is equally represented, then F:4:4:4:4 would be the ratio. But the options have F labeled as 4,4,4,4, which corresponds to this scenario.\n\nBut looking back at the initial problem statement, the options are presented differently. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nOptions A-G are all different ratios. Option F is 4,4,4,4. So perhaps the",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is dominant, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. So, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being expressed.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1 (since C is dominant over c)\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, in terms of expression, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant trait. So for pigment color, any presence of C results in red, regardless of c. Similarly, for body color, any presence of B results in brown, regardless of b.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of pigment and body colors. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype | Pigment | Body | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C recessive, B recessive) | Yes (C) | No (b) | (Probability of C) * (Probability of b) = 1 * (1/2) = 1/2\nPlain red (C dominant, B recessive) | Yes (C) | No (b) | 1 * (1/2) = 1/2\nCheckered brown (C recessive, B dominant) | No (c) | Yes (B) | (1/2) * 1 = 1/2\nPlain brown (C recessive, B dominant) | No (c) | Yes (B) | (1/2) * 1 = 1/2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of probabilities would exceed 1. Let me correct that. Actually, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nEach gene contributes to the phenotype, and the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. Therefore, the probability of a phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait in that phenotype.\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the probability of a particular combination is:\n\nP(C) * P(B) where C and B are either dominant or recessive.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- Pigment red and body checkered: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 1/2 = 1/2\n- Pigment plain and body brown: P(c) * P(B) = 1/2 * 1 = 1/2\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: P(c) * P(b) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1 : 1/2 : 1/2 : 1/4, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1 when multiplied by 4 to eliminate fractions. This adds up to 4+2+2+1=9 parts, so the ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.

Hmm, close but not matching.\n\nWait, my calculation gave a phenotypic ratio of 4:2:2:1, which translates to checkered red (4 parts), checkered brown (2), plain red (2), plain brown (1). So looking at the options, option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only certain phenotypes. Maybe the checkered red and checkered brown refer to specific cases, but according to the given options, none directly matches our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has two possibilities, so the four phenotypes are equally likely? No, because the phenotypes are combinations of both traits. Each gene is dominant, so the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the trait. Therefore, the probability for each phenotype is indeed 1/4 each, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts earlier calculations. Wait, no\u2014it's not exactly 1/4 each because the presence of one dominant allele is sufficient. Let me recast the problem.\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered\n3. Pigment checkered and body brown\n4. Pigment checkered and body checkered\n\nEach of these requires at least one dominant allele for the pigment and at least one dominant allele for the body. So the probability for each phenotype is:\n\nP(Pigment red) * P(Body brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled by 1/4)\nSimilarly, Pigment red * Body checkered: 1 * 1/2 = 1/2\nPigment checkered * Body brown: 1/2 * 1 = 1/2\nPigment checkered * Body checkered: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1 : 1/2 : 1/2 : 1/4, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1 when multiplied by 4. Therefore, checkered red is 4 parts, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 1. None of the options directly reflect this except option G, which has 12, 2, 2, 0.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Since each gene is controlled by a dominant-recessive relationship and both are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probabilities for each gene and then combining them.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n- Presence (Red): Probability = 3/4 (since only cc is recessive)\n- Absence (Plain): Probability = 1/4\n\nFor the body color (B):\n- Presence (Brown): Probability = 3/4\n- Absence (Checkered): Probability = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.

Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, for each phenotype, the probability is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. For example:\n\n- Pigment Red and Body Brown: Both C and B are dominant. So P(C) = 3/4, P(B) = 3/4 \u2192 P = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Pigment Red and Body Checkered: P(C)=3/4, P(b)=1/4 \u2192 3/4*1/4=3/16\n- Pigment Plain and Body Brown: P(c)=1/4, P(B)=3/4 \u2192 1/4*3/4=3/16\n- Pigment Plain and Body Checkered: P(c)=1/4, P(b)=1/4 \u2192 1/4*1/4=1/16\n\nSo adding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Body Brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment Red and Body Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Pigment Plain and Body Brown (c_B_)\n4. Pigment Plain and Body Checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, we need to determine the probability of each phenotype occurring in the F2 generation. Since each gene is controlled by a dominant-recessive relationship and both are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probabilities for each gene and then combining them.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n- Presence (Red): Probability = 3/4 (since only cc is recessive)\n- Absence (Plain): Probability = 1/4\n\nFor the body color (B):\n- Presence (Brown): Probability = 3/4\n- Absence (Checkered): Probability = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability. So:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment Red & Body Brown (Checkered Bird)\n2. Pigment Red & Body Checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered Bird\n3. Pigment Plain & Body Brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Bird\n4. Pigment Plain & Body Checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered Bird?\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, for each phenotype, the probability is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. For example:\n\n- Pigment Red and Body Brown: Both C and B are dominant. So P(C) = 3/4, P(B) = 3/4 \u2192 P = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Pigment Red and Body Checkered: P(C)=3/4, P(b)=1/4 \u2192 3/4*1/4=3/16\n- Pigment Plain and Body Brown: P(c)=1/4, P(B)=3/4 \u2192 1/4*3/4=3/16\n- Pigment Plain and Body Checkered: P(c)=1/4, P(b)=1/4 \u2192 1/4*1/4=1/16\n\nSo adding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. That makes sense.\n\nNow, converting these fractions into ratios:\n\n- Pigment Red & Body Brown: 9: \n- Pigment Red & Body Checkered: 3:\n- Pigment Plain & Body Brown: 3:\n- Pigment Plain & Body Checkered: 1:\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them directly match these numbers. Let me look at the answer choices:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that seems different.

Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut the way the phenotypes are presented depends on whether the bird is checkered (which requires both genes being recessive). Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both C and c alleles are recessive. Similarly, plain is when C is recessive and c is dominant. Brown is when B is dominant, and checkered when B is recessive.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the checkered phenotype is when both C and c are recessive, i.e., the bird's genotype is cc. Because in the question, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, a bird is checkered only if both alleles for pigment are recessive (cc). Similarly, a bird is plain if it has at least one dominant allele (CC or Cc). For color, a bird is brown only if both alleles are dominant (BB or Bb), otherwise, it's checkered (bb).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color recessive (bb) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Pigment recessive (cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine this, we'll use a Punnett square approach, considering the F1's gametes. From earlier, F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in a 50:50 ratio. So the F2 will consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each F1 bird can produce either CB or cb gametes, each at 50%. So when F1 selfs, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- CB + CB = BB\n- CB + cb = Bb\n- cb + CB = Bb\n- cb + cb = bb\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for each combination of C and B, we calculate the probability. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. CC (C from CB and C from CB) \u2192 Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n2. Cc (C from CB and c from cb, or vice versa) \u2192 Probability: 2*(0.5*0.5)=0.5\n3. cc (c from cb and c from cb) \u2192 Probability: 0.25\n4. bb (b from cb and b from cb) \u2192 Probability: 0.25\n\nEach of these genotypes then corresponds to a specific phenotype based on whether the bird is checkered (cc) or plain (CC or Cc), and similarly for color (bb or Bb or Bb).\n\nLet's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C from Cc and C from Cc) \u2192 Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc (C from Cc and c from cc, or c from cc and C from Cc) \u2192 Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Plain red\n- cc (c from cc and c from cc) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb (b from bb and b from bb) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify:\n\nThe actual phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n1. CC (C and C) \u2192 Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. Cc (C and c) \u2192 Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc (c and c) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb (b and b) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: CC and cc \u2192 Phenotype is Checkered brown\n- Plain red: Cc \u2192 Phenotype is Plain red\n- Checkered brown: Same as above\n- Plain brown: bb \u2192 Phenotype is Plain brown\n\nWait, but the user's options include various ratios like 6,2, etc. That suggests that the answer is likely based on F2 counts rather than simple multiplication. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is actually CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but that seems unlikely given the initial description. Wait, the user says \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" so it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nThen, F1 selfing gives F2 with four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (probability 25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. Cc (probability 50%) \u2192 Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc (probability 25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb (probability 25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because when you square CcBb, the phenotypes aren't equally distributed. Wait, no\u2014it's the genotypes that determine the phenotypes, not the number of flies. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the number of flies. So, for example, if a bird is CC, it's red and brown \u2192 Checkered brown. If it's Cc, it's red and checkered \u2192 Plain red. If it's cc, it's plain and brown \u2192 Checkered brown. If it's bb, it's plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered brown: 25% CC + 25% cc = 50%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Checkered brown: same as above (50%), but that can't be since the total would exceed 100%. Wait, no\u2014each bird contributes to the ratio, so the sum should be 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead consider the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFrom F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding up, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: 50% (25% CC + 25% cc)\n- Plain red: 50% (50% Cc)\n- Checkered brown: same as above (another 50% CC + 25% cc?), no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, no, each bird is independent, so the percentages add up across all possible genotypes. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Genotypes\n--- | ---\nCheckered brown (either CC or cc) | 50%\nPlain red (Cc) | 50%\nCheckered brown (same as above) | Not applicable, because it's already counted.\nWait, no\u2014it's better to look at each phenotype separately:\n\n1. Checkered brown: All genotypes where at least one allele is recessive (since both genes are recessive in checkered). So, CC, Cc, cc, but wait, no\u2014only when both are recessive (cc) do you get checkered. Wait, no: Checkered is when both genes are recessive, i.e., cc. Wait, that contradicts what I thought before. Let me clarify: In genetics, checkered refers to having both dominant and recessive alleles. So, for an animal to be checkered, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Wait, but in this case, the term might mean that both genes are recessive, leading to a checkered appearance. So, to be checkered, the bird must be cc for both genes. So, a bird is checkered only if it's cc (i.e., both genes are recessive). Similarly, a bird is plain if it has at least one dominant allele for each gene\u2014so CC or Cc for pigment and BB or Bb for color. A bird is brown only if it's BB or Bb for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color, i.e., Bb. Wait, no: Brown is when both are dominant (BB or Bb), and checkered is when both are recessive (cc). So, let's re-express the phenotypes correctly:\n\nPhenotype | Description | Genotype\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered | Both genes recessive (cc) | cc (for both)\nPlain | At least one dominant allele for both (CC or Cc for pigment; BB or Bb for color) | Other genotypes\nCheckered | Both genes recessive | Same as above\nPlain | As above |\nBrown | Both genes dominant (BB or Bb for pigment; Bb for color) | bb (for pigment; BB or Bb for color)\nCheckered | Both genes recessive | Same as above\nPlain | As above |\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try to define each phenotype clearly:\n\n- **Red**: Pigment is dominant (at least one dominant allele for pigment). So, any bird that is CC, Cc, or CB (wait, CB is a different allele combination?) Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the notation. Let me assume that each bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two for color (B and b). So, for pigment:\n\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor color:\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these:\n\n- **Checkered**: Both genes are recessive (cc for pigment, bb for color) \u2192 phenotype is checkered checkered?\nNo, perhaps the term \"checkered\" specifically refers to having both genes recessive. So, a bird is checkered only if both alleles are recessive for both genes. So, for pigment, cc, and for color, bb.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- **Checkered**: cc (pigment) and bb (color) \u2192 phenotype is checkered checkered? No, perhaps it's simpler: Checkered is when both genes are recessive. So, a bird is checkered only if it's cc for pigment and bb for color. Otherwise, if either gene is dominant, it's not checkered.\n\n- **Plain**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) AND at least one dominant allele for color (BB or Bb). So, the bird is not checkered, nor is it brown.\n\n- **Red**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) BUT recessive allele for color (bb) \u2192 phenotype is red checkered?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let's clarify:\n\nActually, the terms are:\n\n- **Red**: Pigment is dominant (at least one dominant allele) and color is recessive (bb). So, the bird is red and brown? No, wait: If color is recessive (bb), then the bird is brown, even if pigment is dominant. So, the phenotype is red brown? No, perhaps:\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let me think differently: The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\n- **Red and Brown**: Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 phenotype is red brown\n- **Red and Checkered**: Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color recessive (bb) \u2192 phenotype is red checkered\n- **Plain and Brown**: Pigment recessive (cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 phenotype is plain brown\n- **Plain and Checkered**: Pigment recessive (cc) and color recessive (bb) \u2192 phenotype is plain checkered\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Red Brown**: Both dominant traits \u2192 CC (or Cc) and BB (or Bb)\n2. **Red Checkered**: Pigment dominant, color recessive \u2192 Cc (or CB) and bb (or bB)\n3. **Plain Brown**: Pigment recessive, color dominant \u2192 cc (or cc) and BB (or Bb)\n4. **Plain Checkered**: Pigment recessive, color recessive \u2192 cc (or cc) and bb (or bB)\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\nAs previously, F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, so each genotype accounts for a portion of the population.\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (CC)\n- Red Checkered: 50% (Cc)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25:25, but since the question asks for the ratio, we can simplify it by dividing each by 25, resulting in 1:2:1:1. However, the options provided don't directly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says:\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that doesn't align with my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the phenotypes. Maybe the checkered phenotype isn't when both genes are recessive. Let me revisit the terminology.\n\nIn some contexts, \"checkered\" refers to having both dominant alleles, not recessive ones. For example, in animals, checkered often means the bird has both dominant alleles for both coat and eye colors. But in genetics, typically, checkered refers to recessive alleles. So, perhaps I was correct initially.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (CC)\n- Red Checkered: 50% (Cc)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (bb)\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 1:2:1:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Option E is:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. Option G is:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nNope. Option H is:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nStill not matching. Option I is:\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of them seem to align with my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation results in 9 possible phenotypes, but due to dominance, certain combinations are less frequent. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation is being considered without considering the order of parents, leading to different probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach is to create a Punnett square for F1 x F1, considering the F2 generation. Given that F1 is CcBb, the F2 would be:\n\n        | C   | c\n      ---------------------\n        C | CC | Cc\n        c | Cc | cc\n\nBut considering the two genes, the Punnett square becomes more complex. Instead of a simple 2x2, it's a 4x4 grid, considering all combinations of the two genes. Each F1 bird can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 bird is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the Punnett square would involve all possible combinations of these gametes.\n\nBut this could get complicated quickly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to consider a dihybrid cross with a different approach, such as using the F1 as a single gene, but that wouldn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in defining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the original question. The user wrote:\n\nThe checkered phenotype is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. \n\nAh! Here's the key point. The checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, i.e., cc. The checkered phenotype is usually associated with having both genes recessive, but in reality, in many cases, checkered refers to having both dominant alleles, but in genetics, it's recessive. So, perhaps the user mixed up the definitions.\n\nIf we take \"checkered\" as having at least one dominant allele for each gene (i.e., not both recessive), then:\n\n- **Checkered**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) and at least one dominant allele for color (BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- **Plain**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) and at least one recessive allele for color (bb) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- **Red**: Only recessive for pigment (cc) and dominant for color (BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n-",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So each bird can have:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut the way the phenotypes are presented depends on whether the bird is checkered (which requires both genes being recessive). Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both C and c alleles are recessive. Similarly, plain is when C is recessive and c is dominant. Brown is when B is dominant, and checkered when B is recessive.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the checkered phenotype is when both C and c are recessive, i.e., the bird's genotype is cc. Because in the question, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, a bird is checkered only if both alleles for pigment are recessive (cc). Similarly, a bird is plain if it has at least one dominant allele (CC or Cc). For color, a bird is brown only if both alleles are dominant (BB or Bb), otherwise, it's checkered (bb).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color recessive (bb) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Pigment recessive (cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine this, we'll use a Punnett square approach, considering the F1's gametes. From earlier, F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in a 50:50 ratio. So the F2 will consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each F1 bird can produce either CB or cb gametes, each at 50%. So when F1 selfs, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- CB + CB = BB\n- CB + cb = Bb\n- cb + CB = Bb\n- cb + cb = bb\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for each combination of C and B, we calculate the probability. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. CC (C from CB and C from CB) \u2192 Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n2. Cc (C from CB and c from cb, or vice versa) \u2192 Probability: 2*(0.5*0.5)=0.5\n3. cc (c from cb and c from cb) \u2192 Probability: 0.25\n4. bb (b from cb and b from cb) \u2192 Probability: 0.25\n\nEach of these genotypes then corresponds to a specific phenotype based on whether the bird is checkered (cc) or plain (CC or Cc), and similarly for color (bb or Bb or Bb).\n\nLet's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C from Cc and C from Cc) \u2192 Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc (C from Cc and c from cc, or c from cc and C from Cc) \u2192 Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Plain red\n- cc (c from cc and c from cc) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb (b from bb and b from bb) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify:\n\nThe actual phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n1. CC (C and C) \u2192 Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. Cc (C and c) \u2192 Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc (c and c) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb (b and b) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: CC and cc \u2192 Phenotype is Checkered brown\n- Plain red: Cc \u2192 Phenotype is Plain red\n- Checkered brown: Same as above\n- Plain brown: bb \u2192 Phenotype is Plain brown\n\nWait, but the user's options include various ratios like 6,2, etc. That suggests that the answer is likely based on F2 counts rather than simple multiplication. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is actually CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but that seems unlikely given the initial description. Wait, the user says \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" so it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nThen, F1 selfing gives F2 with four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (probability 25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. Cc (probability 50%) \u2192 Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc (probability 25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb (probability 25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because when you square CcBb, the phenotypes aren't equally distributed. Wait, no\u2014it's the genotypes that determine the phenotypes, not the number of flies. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the number of flies. So, for example, if a bird is CC, it's red and brown \u2192 Checkered brown. If it's Cc, it's red and checkered \u2192 Plain red. If it's cc, it's plain and brown \u2192 Checkered brown. If it's bb, it's plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered brown: 25% CC + 25% cc = 50%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Checkered brown: same as above (50%), but that can't be since the total would exceed 100%. Wait, no\u2014each bird contributes to the ratio, so the sum should be 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead consider the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFrom F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding up, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: 50% (25% CC + 25% cc)\n- Plain red: 50% (50% Cc)\n- Checkered brown: same as above (another 50% CC + 25% cc?), no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, no, each bird is independent, so the percentages add up across all possible genotypes. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Genotypes\n--- | ---\nCheckered brown (either CC or cc) | 50%\nPlain red (Cc) | 50%\nCheckered brown (same as above) | Not applicable, because it's already counted.\nWait, no\u2014it's better to look at each phenotype separately:\n\n1. Checkered brown: All genotypes where at least one allele is recessive (since both genes are recessive in checkered). So, CC, Cc, cc, but wait, no\u2014only when both are recessive (cc) do you get checkered. Wait, no: Checkered is when both genes are recessive, i.e., cc. Wait, that contradicts what I thought before. Let me clarify: In genetics, checkered refers to having both dominant and recessive alleles. So, for an animal to be checkered, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Wait, but in this case, the term might mean that both genes are recessive, leading to a checkered appearance. So, to be checkered, the bird must be cc for both genes. So, a bird is checkered only if it's cc (i.e., both genes are recessive). Similarly, a bird is plain if it has at least one dominant allele for each gene\u2014so CC or Cc for pigment and BB or Bb for color. A bird is brown only if it's BB or Bb for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color, i.e., Bb. Wait, no: Brown is when both are dominant (BB or Bb), and checkered is when both are recessive (cc). So, let's re-express the phenotypes correctly:\n\nPhenotype | Description | Genotype\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered | Both genes recessive (cc) | cc (for both)\nPlain | At least one dominant allele for both (CC or Cc for pigment; BB or Bb for color) | Other genotypes\nCheckered | Both genes recessive | Same as above\nPlain | As above |\nBrown | Both genes dominant (BB or Bb for pigment; Bb for color) | bb (for pigment; BB or Bb for color)\nCheckered | Both genes recessive | Same as above\nPlain | As above |\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try to define each phenotype clearly:\n\n- **Red**: Pigment is dominant (at least one dominant allele for pigment). So, any bird that is CC, Cc, or CB (wait, CB is a different allele combination?) Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the notation. Let me assume that each bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two for color (B and b). So, for pigment:\n\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor color:\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these:\n\n- **Checkered**: Both genes are recessive (cc for pigment, bb for color) \u2192 phenotype is checkered checkered?\nNo, perhaps the term \"checkered\" specifically refers to having both genes recessive. So, a bird is checkered only if both alleles are recessive for both genes. So, for pigment, cc, and for color, bb.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- **Checkered**: cc (pigment) and bb (color) \u2192 phenotype is checkered checkered? No, perhaps it's simpler: Checkered is when both genes are recessive. So, a bird is checkered only if it's cc for pigment and bb for color. Otherwise, if either gene is dominant, it's not checkered.\n\n- **Plain**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) AND at least one dominant allele for color (BB or Bb). So, the bird is not checkered, nor is it brown.\n\n- **Red**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) BUT recessive allele for color (bb) \u2192 phenotype is red checkered?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let's clarify:\n\nActually, the terms are:\n\n- **Red**: Pigment is dominant (at least one dominant allele) and color is recessive (bb). So, the bird is red and brown? No, wait: If color is recessive (bb), then the bird is brown, even if pigment is dominant. So, the phenotype is red brown? No, perhaps:\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let me think differently: The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\n- **Red and Brown**: Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 phenotype is red brown\n- **Red and Checkered**: Pigment dominant (CC or Cc) and color recessive (bb) \u2192 phenotype is red checkered\n- **Plain and Brown**: Pigment recessive (cc) and color dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 phenotype is plain brown\n- **Plain and Checkered**: Pigment recessive (cc) and color recessive (bb) \u2192 phenotype is plain checkered\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Red Brown**: Both dominant traits \u2192 CC (or Cc) and BB (or Bb)\n2. **Red Checkered**: Pigment dominant, color recessive \u2192 Cc (or CB) and bb (or bB)\n3. **Plain Brown**: Pigment recessive, color dominant \u2192 cc (or cc) and BB (or Bb)\n4. **Plain Checkered**: Pigment recessive, color recessive \u2192 cc (or cc) and bb (or bB)\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\nAs previously, F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, so each genotype accounts for a portion of the population.\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (CC)\n- Red Checkered: 50% (Cc)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25:25, but since the question asks for the ratio, we can simplify it by dividing each by 25, resulting in 1:2:1:1. However, the options provided don't directly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says:\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that doesn't align with my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the phenotypes. Maybe the checkered phenotype isn't when both genes are recessive. Let me revisit the terminology.\n\nIn some contexts, \"checkered\" refers to having both dominant alleles, not recessive ones. For example, in animals, checkered often means the bird has both dominant alleles for both coat and eye colors. But in genetics, typically, checkered refers to recessive alleles. So, perhaps I was correct initially.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (CC)\n- Red Checkered: 50% (Cc)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (bb)\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 1:2:1:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Option E is:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. Option G is:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nNope. Option H is:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nStill not matching. Option I is:\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of them seem to align with my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation results in 9 possible phenotypes, but due to dominance, certain combinations are less frequent. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation is being considered without considering the order of parents, leading to different probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach is to create a Punnett square for F1 x F1, considering the F2 generation. Given that F1 is CcBb, the F2 would be:\n\n        | C   | c\n      ---------------------\n        C | CC | Cc\n        c | Cc | cc\n\nBut considering the two genes, the Punnett square becomes more complex. Instead of a simple 2x2, it's a 4x4 grid, considering all combinations of the two genes. Each F1 bird can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 bird is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the Punnett square would involve all possible combinations of these gametes.\n\nBut this could get complicated quickly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to consider a dihybrid cross with a different approach, such as using the F1 as a single gene, but that wouldn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in defining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the original question. The user wrote:\n\nThe checkered phenotype is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. \n\nAh! Here's the key point. The checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, i.e., cc. The checkered phenotype is usually associated with having both genes recessive, but in reality, in many cases, checkered refers to having both dominant alleles, but in genetics, it's recessive. So, perhaps the user mixed up the definitions.\n\nIf we take \"checkered\" as having at least one dominant allele for each gene (i.e., not both recessive), then:\n\n- **Checkered**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) and at least one dominant allele for color (BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- **Plain**: At least one dominant allele for pigment (CC or Cc) and at least one recessive allele for color (bb) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- **Red**: Only recessive for pigment (cc) and dominant for color (BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n-",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for pigment color: red or plain.",
    "rollout": " So for pigment color: red or plain. For body color: brown or checkered.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the phenotype is described as \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". So each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes based on these two traits. Now, since the genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype can be found by calculating the product of the probabilities for each trait. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Presence (Red): 100% (since C is dominant)\n- Absence (Plain): 0%\n\nSo for the pigment trait, the probability is always 1 for red and 0 for plain.\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n\n- Presence (Brown): 100%\n- Absence (Checkered): 0%\n\nBut wait, the actual colors are determined by the alleles, so brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b). So for the color trait, the presence is brown, absence is checkered.\n\nNow, since both traits are controlled by separate genes and the parents are homozygous for both traits (as per their genotype), the F2 generation will have a certain distribution of these traits. But wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. That makes sense because for the C gene, both parents are homozygous dominant (CC) and homozygous recessive (cc) respectively. Similarly for the B gene. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the results of selfing F1.\n\nGiven that, let's compute the phenotypic ratios. The F2 would have four possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC bb\n3. cc BB\n4. cc bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes. But wait, in reality, the bird's phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Since both C and B are dominant, all these genotypes would express the same phenotype: checkered red (assuming the bird is checkered due to the recessive c and brown due to the dominant B). Alternatively, some genotypes may lead to different phenotypes depending on the interaction between the two genes, but since each gene contributes independently, it's unlikely that they interact beyond determining the dominance status.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. This implies that the two genes influence different aspects of the phenotype. For example, one gene affects pigment color, and another affects body color. So, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene would determine the phenotype, regardless of the other gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would depend on the probabilities of having at least one dominant allele in each gene. Since each gene has a 100% chance of being expressed (as C and B are dominant), the phenotypes are determined solely by whether the alleles are present. Thus, the bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment: Checkered (if c is present, i.e., recessive)\n- Color: Brown (if B is present, i.e., dominant)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (cB)\n- Checkered brown (cb)\n- Plain red (cc)\n- Plain brown (CC)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Because if the bird is checkered (c is present, i.e., recessive), then regardless of the color gene, it would be checkered. Similarly, if it's plain (cc), regardless of color, it's plain. So the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (c is present), then its color is determined by the color gene (B/B or Bb/bb):\n  - Brown (B present)\n  - Checkered (b present)\n\n- If the bird is plain (cc), then its color is determined by the color gene:\n  - Brown (B present)\n  - Checkered (b present)\n\nBut wait, if the bird is checkered (c present), then regardless of the color gene, it's checkered. Similarly, if it's plain (cc), regardless of the color gene, it's plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the recessive alleles in each gene. So the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Both recessive (c and b): checkered plain (but wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, the bird would be checkered (due to c) and plain (due to b)? Wait, no\u2014it's a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the recessive alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered (c present) \u2192 regardless of the color (B or b), the bird is checkered.\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 regardless of the color (B or b), the bird is plain.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Brown (B present) \u2192 regardless of the checkering (c or b), the bird is brown.\n- Checkered (b present) \u2192 regardless of the color (B or c), the bird is checkered.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to list all possible genotypic combinations and map them to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n10. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Wait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so F2 comes from selfing CcBb.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer options don't include any F2 data except for option A showing checkered red 6, etc. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, so perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" But looking back at the user's message, the options are labeled A through H, each giving a different phenotypic ratio. However, the user might have intended to ask for the F1 instead. But given the context, perhaps the user wants the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the options, and the question is asking about the F1 rather than F2. But the instructions say to focus on F2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial problem statement:\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits, typically a heterozygote producing gametes for two traits. In this case, the parents are homozygous for both traits: CC BB and cc bb. So their offspring would be CcBb, and then selfing to get F2.\n\nSo the F2 would consist of the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nAnd the corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nSo the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Checkered brown: 6 (cases 1,2,4,5,7,8)\n- Checkered plain: 3 (cases 3,6,9)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cases 7,10)\n- Plain red: 1 (case 10)\n\nWait, but where does case 10 come from? Case 10 would be the last term in the F2 list, which is cc bb. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered brown: 6\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain red: 1\n\nWhich matches option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no, my counts don't match that. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. But according to my count, checkered brown is 6, checkered plain is 3, plain brown is 2, plain red is 1. None of the options match exactly. Let me double-check the counts:\n\nLooking back at the F2 list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered brown: cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered plain: cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain red: case 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but none of the options match this exact breakdown. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems way off from what I've got.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 9 (since 3x3 grid).\n\nCase 1: checkered brown\nCases 2,4,5: also checkered brown \u2192 4\nCases 3,6: checkered plain \u2192 2\nCases 7,8: plain brown \u2192 2\nCase 9: plain red \u2192 1\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Checkered plain: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain red: 1\n\nBut the options don't have these numbers. The closest option is option D, which has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our counts. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and it's about F1 instead of F2.\n\nIf the question was about F1, the phenotypic ratio would be simpler. F1 is CcBb, which can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 would have the following phenotypes based on the combination of gametes:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb \u2192 the possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). Then, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Cc (25%) \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown, 25% plain red, and 25% checkered red. But the options don't reflect this. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests a much higher proportion of checkered brown.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Again, too high for plain red.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Only two phenotypes, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums up to 12, which is close to the total of 9. Wait, that can't be right because 2+6=8, plus 3+1=4, totaling 12, which exceeds the total number of F2 individuals (9). So that's impossible.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Sum is 16, which is too high.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, summing to 16, which is wrong.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, which is incorrect.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16, which is wrong.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16, which is wrong.\n\nSo none of the options seem to match the F2 phenotypic ratio I derived. However, perhaps the initial assumption about the question is incorrect. Maybe the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio instead. Let's explore that possibility.\n\nIn F1, the phenotypes would be based on the combination of the two genes. Since both genes have dominant alleles, each bird would exhibit the same phenotype as the others, regardless of the genotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of the recessive alleles.\n\nSince both genes are linked with dominant alleles, the phenotypes would be as follows:\n\n- Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, how many birds of each phenotype would result from the F1 generation?\n\nF1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb x cb)\n\nThen, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown, 25% plain red, and 25% checkered red. But none of the options reflect this, as each option represents a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me consider the actual genotypic distribution in F2.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross (two independent traits), the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but that applies when each trait is independent and dominant. Here, both traits are controlled by dominant alleles, so each bird would display the same phenotype regardless of genotype, unless the phenotype combines both traits.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the recessive alleles for each trait. So, the four phenotypes are as follows:\n\n1. Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n3. Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nAssuming all four phenotypes are equally likely, the expected ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But in reality, the presence of the recessive alleles leads to blending of traits, but in this case, since both traits are governed by dominant alleles, each bird will display the phenotype corresponding to the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown, 25% plain red, and 25% checkered red. Which translates to a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options provided do not include such a ratio. Instead, all options represent ratios like 6:2:1 or similar. This suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the question refers to something else, such as F1 instead of F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly stating the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best course of action is to choose the option that most closely resembles the F2 phenotypic ratio. However, since none of the options perfectly match my calculations, I'll have to infer from the possible answers. Looking at option D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color: red or plain. For body color: brown or checkered.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the phenotype is described as \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". So each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes based on these two traits. Now, since the genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype can be found by calculating the product of the probabilities for each trait. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Presence (Red): 100% (since C is dominant)\n- Absence (Plain): 0%\n\nSo for the pigment trait, the probability is always 1 for red and 0 for plain.\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n\n- Presence (Brown): 100%\n- Absence (Checkered): 0%\n\nBut wait, the actual colors are determined by the alleles, so brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b). So for the color trait, the presence is brown, absence is checkered.\n\nNow, since both traits are controlled by separate genes and the parents are homozygous for both traits (as per their genotype), the F2 generation will have a certain distribution of these traits. But wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. That makes sense because for the C gene, both parents are homozygous dominant (CC) and homozygous recessive (cc) respectively. Similarly for the B gene. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the results of selfing F1.\n\nGiven that, let's compute the phenotypic ratios. The F2 would have four possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC bb\n3. cc BB\n4. cc bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes. But wait, in reality, the bird's phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Since both C and B are dominant, all these genotypes would express the same phenotype: checkered red (assuming the bird is checkered due to the recessive c and brown due to the dominant B). Alternatively, some genotypes may lead to different phenotypes depending on the interaction between the two genes, but since each gene contributes independently, it's unlikely that they interact beyond determining the dominance status.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. This implies that the two genes influence different aspects of the phenotype. For example, one gene affects pigment color, and another affects body color. So, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene would determine the phenotype, regardless of the other gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would depend on the probabilities of having at least one dominant allele in each gene. Since each gene has a 100% chance of being expressed (as C and B are dominant), the phenotypes are determined solely by whether the alleles are present. Thus, the bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment: Checkered (if c is present, i.e., recessive)\n- Color: Brown (if B is present, i.e., dominant)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (cB)\n- Checkered brown (cb)\n- Plain red (cc)\n- Plain brown (CC)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Because if the bird is checkered (c is present, i.e., recessive), then regardless of the color gene, it would be checkered. Similarly, if it's plain (cc), regardless of color, it's plain. So the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (c is present), then its color is determined by the color gene (B/B or Bb/bb):\n  - Brown (B present)\n  - Checkered (b present)\n\n- If the bird is plain (cc), then its color is determined by the color gene:\n  - Brown (B present)\n  - Checkered (b present)\n\nBut wait, if the bird is checkered (c present), then regardless of the color gene, it's checkered. Similarly, if it's plain (cc), regardless of the color gene, it's plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of the recessive alleles in each gene. So the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Both recessive (c and b): checkered plain (but wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, the bird would be checkered (due to c) and plain (due to b)? Wait, no\u2014it's a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the recessive alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered (c present) \u2192 regardless of the color (B or b), the bird is checkered.\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 regardless of the color (B or b), the bird is plain.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Brown (B present) \u2192 regardless of the checkering (c or b), the bird is brown.\n- Checkered (b present) \u2192 regardless of the color (B or c), the bird is checkered.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to list all possible genotypic combinations and map them to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n10. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Wait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so F2 comes from selfing CcBb.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer options don't include any F2 data except for option A showing checkered red 6, etc. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, so perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" But looking back at the user's message, the options are labeled A through H, each giving a different phenotypic ratio. However, the user might have intended to ask for the F1 instead. But given the context, perhaps the user wants the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the options, and the question is asking about the F1 rather than F2. But the instructions say to focus on F2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial problem statement:\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits, typically a heterozygote producing gametes for two traits. In this case, the parents are homozygous for both traits: CC BB and cc bb. So their offspring would be CcBb, and then selfing to get F2.\n\nSo the F2 would consist of the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nAnd the corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nSo the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Checkered brown: 6 (cases 1,2,4,5,7,8)\n- Checkered plain: 3 (cases 3,6,9)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cases 7,10)\n- Plain red: 1 (case 10)\n\nWait, but where does case 10 come from? Case 10 would be the last term in the F2 list, which is cc bb. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered brown: 6\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain red: 1\n\nWhich matches option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no, my counts don't match that. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. But according to my count, checkered brown is 6, checkered plain is 3, plain brown is 2, plain red is 1. None of the options match exactly. Let me double-check the counts:\n\nLooking back at the F2 list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered brown: cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered plain: cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain red: case 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but none of the options match this exact breakdown. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems way off from what I've got.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 9 (since 3x3 grid).\n\nCase 1: checkered brown\nCases 2,4,5: also checkered brown \u2192 4\nCases 3,6: checkered plain \u2192 2\nCases 7,8: plain brown \u2192 2\nCase 9: plain red \u2192 1\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Checkered plain: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain red: 1\n\nBut the options don't have these numbers. The closest option is option D, which has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our counts. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and it's about F1 instead of F2.\n\nIf the question was about F1, the phenotypic ratio would be simpler. F1 is CcBb, which can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 would have the following phenotypes based on the combination of gametes:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb \u2192 the possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). Then, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Cc (25%) \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown, 25% plain red, and 25% checkered red. But the options don't reflect this. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests a much higher proportion of checkered brown.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Again, too high for plain red.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Only two phenotypes, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums up to 12, which is close to the total of 9. Wait, that can't be right because 2+6=8, plus 3+1=4, totaling 12, which exceeds the total number of F2 individuals (9). So that's impossible.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Sum is 16, which is too high.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, summing to 16, which is wrong.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, which is incorrect.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16, which is wrong.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16, which is wrong.\n\nSo none of the options seem to match the F2 phenotypic ratio I derived. However, perhaps the initial assumption about the question is incorrect. Maybe the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio instead. Let's explore that possibility.\n\nIn F1, the phenotypes would be based on the combination of the two genes. Since both genes have dominant alleles, each bird would exhibit the same phenotype as the others, regardless of the genotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of the recessive alleles.\n\nSince both genes are linked with dominant alleles, the phenotypes would be as follows:\n\n- Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, how many birds of each phenotype would result from the F1 generation?\n\nF1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb x cb)\n\nThen, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown, 25% plain red, and 25% checkered red. But none of the options reflect this, as each option represents a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me consider the actual genotypic distribution in F2.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross (two independent traits), the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but that applies when each trait is independent and dominant. Here, both traits are controlled by dominant alleles, so each bird would display the same phenotype regardless of genotype, unless the phenotype combines both traits.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the recessive alleles for each trait. So, the four phenotypes are as follows:\n\n1. Checkered (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. Checkered (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 checkered plain\n3. Plain (cc) and Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain (cc) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n\nAssuming all four phenotypes are equally likely, the expected ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But in reality, the presence of the recessive alleles leads to blending of traits, but in this case, since both traits are governed by dominant alleles, each bird will display the phenotype corresponding to the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown, 25% plain red, and 25% checkered red. Which translates to a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options provided do not include such a ratio. Instead, all options represent ratios like 6:2:1 or similar. This suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the question refers to something else, such as F1 instead of F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly stating the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best course of action is to choose the option that most closely resembles the F2 phenotypic ratio. However, since none of the options perfectly match my calculations, I'll have to infer from the possible answers. Looking at option D",

Maybe I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me go back.\n\nAh! Wait, no\u2014the problem says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the first parent is CC BB \u2192 phenotype checkered red. The second parent is cc bb \u2192 phenotype plain brown. So their F1 would be CcBb \u2192 phenotype checkered brown, and the F2 would have various genotypes leading to different phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb, which is checkered brown. Then, when F1 selfs (F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (if CB gamete combines with CB gamete)\n- Cc (if CB combines with cb)\n- cc (if cb combines with cb)\n- bb (if cb combines with cb)\n\nBut considering the actual gametes from F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent (F1) produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each). So F1 (CcBb) will produce four possible gametes when crossed with itself:\n\n- CB (from C of Cc and C of Cc)\n- CB (from C of Cc and b of bc)\n- cb (from c of Cc and C of bc)\n- cb (from c of Cc and b of bc)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to use a Punnett square approach. F1 is CcBb. Each F1 bird produces four gametes: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, and 25% cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on the combination of gametes:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (25% chance)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes will be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor Gene C (C vs c):\n- Presence (C): 25% (from CC BB)\n- Absence (c): 75% (from CcBb and cc bb?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the F2 includes:\n\n- CC BB (25%): checkered red\n- CcBb (50%): checkered brown\n- cc bb (25%): plain brown\n\nBecause:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB \u2192 red\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 brown\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 brown\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb \u2192 brown\n\nWait, but that seems off because if F1 is CcBb, then in F2, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly for the B locus: B (75%) and b (25%).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo for phenotype \"checkered red\":\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 presence (C)\n- B is recessive \u2192 absent (b)\n\u2192 Probability = (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nSimilarly, \"checkered brown\":\n\n- C is present\n- B is present (so b is absent)\n\u2192 Probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n\"Plain red\":\n\n- C is absent (c)\n- B is present (B)\n\u2192 Probability = 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n\"Plain brown\":\n\n- Both C and B are absent\n\u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This corresponds to 1:3:9:3, which adds up to 16. But according to our calculation, the probabilities are approximately 6.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 56.25%, which sum to 100%.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly these numbers. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16, but the actual probabilities don't fit any option perfectly. Option H suggests checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Our calculations suggest around 6.25%, 18.75%, etc., which isn't listed exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options were rounded differently. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since 4 x 4).\n\n- checkered red: (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25 \u2192 1 individual (rounded up)\n- checkered brown: (25% C) * (75% B) = 18.75 \u2192 3 individuals\n- plain red: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75 \u2192 3 individuals\n- plain brown: (75% c) * (75% B) = 56.25 \u2192 9 individuals\n\nSo the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9, which sums to 16. None of the options exactly match this, but option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is less than 16. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16. That matches closely: 3+9+1+3=16.\n\nSo the correct answer might be E, but according to my calculation, the exact ratio isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the options are approximated. Given that, option E's ratio totals 16, which aligns with the 4 x 4 Punnett square. Therefore, despite slight differences in the exact percentages, option E's ratio (3:9:1:3) matches the expected distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment dominant (C) and color dominant (B): Checkered red (since c is plain and b is brown, wait no\u2014if c is plain, then checkered would require c, but B is brown, so maybe brown checkered? Hmm, maybe I got confused earlier.)\n\nWait, let me clarify: \n\n- Gene C: \n  - C \u2192 pigment (red)\n  - c \u2192 plain\n- Gene B:\n  - B \u2192 color (brown)\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes for each bird are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and color brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and color checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and color brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and color checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, looking back at the options given in the question, the phenotypic ratios include options like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (which would be cc bb, so phenotype plain brown) and a plain brown bird (which would be cc bb as well, but wait\u2014that's conflicting. Wait, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype cc bb \u2192 phenotype plain brown\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 genotype cc bb \u2192 same as above?\n\nWait, that can't be right. If both parents are cc bb, their offspring would all be cc bb, which is plain brown. That doesn't make sense because the question implies that there are different phenotypes. Maybe I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me go back.\n\nAh! Wait, no\u2014the problem says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the first parent is CC BB \u2192 phenotype checkered red. The second parent is cc bb \u2192 phenotype plain brown. So their F1 would be CcBb \u2192 phenotype checkered brown, and the F2 would have various genotypes leading to different phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb, which is checkered brown. Then, when F1 selfs (F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (if CB gamete combines with CB gamete)\n- Cc (if CB combines with cb)\n- cc (if cb combines with cb)\n- bb (if cb combines with cb)\n\nBut considering the actual gametes from F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent (F1) produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each). So F1 (CcBb) will produce four possible gametes when crossed with itself:\n\n- CB (from C of Cc and C of Cc)\n- CB (from C of Cc and b of bc)\n- cb (from c of Cc and C of bc)\n- cb (from c of Cc and b of bc)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to use a Punnett square approach. F1 is CcBb. Each F1 bird produces four gametes: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, and 25% cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on the combination of gametes:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (25% chance)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes will be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor Gene C (C vs c):\n- Presence (C): 25% (from CC BB)\n- Absence (c): 75% (from CcBb and cc bb?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the F2 includes:\n\n- CC BB (25%): checkered red\n- CcBb (50%): checkered brown\n- cc bb (25%): plain brown\n\nBecause:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB \u2192 red\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 brown\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 brown\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb \u2192 brown\n\nWait, but that seems off because if F1 is CcBb, then in F2, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly for the B locus: B (75%) and b (25%).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo for phenotype \"checkered red\":\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 presence (C)\n- B is recessive \u2192 absent (b)\n\u2192 Probability = (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nSimilarly, \"checkered brown\":\n\n- C is present\n- B is present (so b is absent)\n\u2192 Probability = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n\"Plain red\":\n\n- C is absent (c)\n- B is present (B)\n\u2192 Probability = 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n\"Plain brown\":\n\n- Both C and B are absent\n\u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

    "rollout": " So for pigment color, possible phenotypes are red or plain, and for body color, brown or checkered. Thus, four possible phenotypic combinations: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the expected phenotypic ratio in F2:\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC (all red), 50% Cc (some red, some plain?), wait no\u2014wait, for the C locus, the presence of the dominant allele (C) results in red, regardless of the B locus. Similarly, the B locus's presence (B) results in brown, regardless of the C locus. So the phenotype depends on whether either of the dominant alleles is present. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. Let's tabulate the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all possible genotypes for the F2 and determine their phenotypes:\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider the probability of each phenotype based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Alternatively, since each gene is independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. However, since each bird has two traits (pigment and color), the overall phenotypic ratio combines the effects of both genes.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the expected number of each phenotype by considering the genotypic ratios and then translating them into phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nFirst, calculate the proportion of each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- CC BB: 25%\nWait, no\u2014correctly, each of the four genotypic combinations occurs at 25% frequency in F2.\n\nSo now, for each genotype, what phenotype does it express?\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it is red.\n- If it has none (i.e., cc), it is plain.\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- If it has at least one B allele, it is brown.\n- If it has none (i.e., bb), it is checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of the two traits:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n\nWait, that seems too many. Actually, each bird has two separate traits, so the F2 phenotypic ratio can be computed by considering the possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to calculate the probability of each phenotype by looking at the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nEach gene has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), so for each trait, the probability is:\n\n- Pigment: 75% (since 25% are cc)\n- Color: 75% (since 25% are bb)\n\nHowever, since the two traits are independent, the combined probability is 75% * 75% = 56.25%, but this doesn't directly translate to the phenotypic ratio. Instead, we need to count the number of birds that exhibit each combination of traits.\n\nLet me make a table of all possible combinations and their probabilities:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (C and B):\n   - Pigment: C \u2192 red\n   - Color: B \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: red-brown\n   Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n2. Pigment dominant (C), color recessive (b):\n   - Red-brown\n   Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\n3. Pigment dominant (C), color dominant (B):\n   - Red-brown\n   Probability: same as above, 1/16\n\n4. Pigment dominant (C), color recessive (b):\n   - Red-checkered\n   Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\n5. Pigment recessive (cc), color dominant (B):\n   - Plain-brown\n   Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n6. Pigment recessive (cc), color recessive (bb):\n   - Plain-checkered\n   Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but this approach might not account for all combinations properly. Another way is to calculate the probability for each phenotype as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: red-brown (both C and B dominant)\nProbability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 2: red-checkered (C present, B absent)\nProbability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nPhenotype 3: plain-brown (C absent, B present)\nProbability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: plain-checkered (C absent, B absent)\nProbability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nAdding these up: 3+1+3+3=10 parts out of 16. That accounts for all possibilities.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:3:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match our calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (palisade) is when neither allele is dominant, i.e., recessive. So plain is palisade (c), and red is dominant (C). Brown is dominant (B).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can also be thought of as:\n\n- Both dominant: red-brown\n- Pigmented dominant, colored recessive: red-palisade\n- Pigmented recessive, colored dominant: palisade-brown\n- Both recessive: palisade-palisade\n\nBut according to standard classification, checkered (palisade) is when neither allele is dominant, so that's plain.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\nIn genetics, the term \"checkered\" refers to the absence of the dominant allele, resulting in a palisade (checkered) appearance. So:\n\n- C/B: red-brown\n- C/b: red-palisade\n- cb/B: palisade-brown\n- cb/bb: palisade-palisade\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Red-palisade (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Palisade-brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Palisade-palisade (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Red-brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n2. Red-palisade: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n3. Palisade-brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n4. Palisade-palisade: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSo adding these up: 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 3:1:3:9.\n\nWait, but in the options given, option G is: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit. Option J is: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For the C gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. For the B gene, the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele is present for each gene.\n\nSo, for the C gene:\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits.\n\nTo find the probabilities:\n\nThe chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is:\n\n- For C: 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- For B: 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for having both dominant alleles (red-brown).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only C dominant (and B recessive) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nOnly B dominant (and C recessive): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nNeither dominant (C and B recessive): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to red-brown : red-palisade : palisade-brown : palisade-palisade.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:0\n\nB. 8:4:0\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:0:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nK. 4:4:4:4\n\nL. 9:3:3:1\n\nM. 12:2:2:0\n\nN. 5:3:2:6\n\nO. 3:9:1:3\n\nP. 4:4:4:4\n\nQ. 2:6:3:1\n\nR. 1:1:1:1\n\nS. 3:1:1:3\n\nT. 1:3:9:3\n\nU. 3:9:3:1\n\nV. 9:3:3:1\n\nW. 1:3:9:3\n\nX. 3:1:1:3\n\nY. 1:2:2:1\n\nZ. 2:4:4:2\n\nThese don't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the phenotypic ratio refers to the number of birds rather than the ratio of phenotypes. Let me see.\n\nIf the F2 generation has 16 birds (since F2 is a dihybrid cross, which typically results in 9:3:3:1, summing to 16), then the phenotypic counts would be 9 red-brown, 3 red-palisade, 3 palisade-brown, and 1 palisade-palisade.\n\nBut the options don't include this exact ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, option L is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but inverted. Option V is 9:3:3:1, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo, if the F2 has 16 birds, the counts would be 9 red-brown, 3 red-palisade, 3 palisade-brown, and 1 palisade-palisade. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option L.\n\nBut looking back, the options provided are A to Z, with each being a specific ratio. Option L is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio refers to the number of each type without considering dominance, but that doesn't align with standard classification.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is option L: 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But according to our calculation, the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: The checkered pattern involves a dominant gene C, which controls pigment color, and the plain involves recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by B, and brown by b. So, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- Checkered (palisade) = both alleles recessive (c and c)\n- Plain (black) = both alleles dominant (C and C)\n- Checkered (palisade) could also refer to the color, but in this context, it's probably referring to the presence of the recessive allele for color.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify the terminology:\n\n- Checkered (palisade) is when neither allele is dominant, i.e., recessive.\n- Plain is when both alleles are dominant (for the other trait, say, color).\n\nWait, but the problem states:\n\nRed color is controlled by B (dominant), brown by b (recessive).\nCheckered control by C (dominant), plain by recessive.\n\nSo, for each trait, checkered is dominant (C), plain is recessive (c).\n\nFor the coat color, red is dominant (B), brown is recessive (b).\n\nSo, the four phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both traits:\n\n1. Both dominant: red-brown\n2. Pigmented dominant, colored recessive: red-palisade\n3. Pigmented recessive, colored dominant: palisade-brown\n4. Both recessive: palisade-palisade\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n1. Both dominant: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigmented dominant, recessive color: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n3. Pigmented recessive, dominant color: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option L (if L is 3:9:1:3), but that's inverted. Alternatively, option V is 9:3:3:1, which matches.\n\nGiven the options provided, option V (9:3:3:1) is available, but looking at the user's choices, option L is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1. However, option V is present. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write 9:3:3:1 as option L, but that's not how it's presented.\n\nWait, let me look again at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Reversed.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal, which would imply 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Reversed.\n\nM. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nN. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nO. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches.\n\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nQ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nR. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nS. 3,1,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nT. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nU. 3,9,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nV. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nW. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nX. 3,1,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nY. 1,2,2,1 \u2192 No.\n\nZ. 2,4,4,2 \u2192 No.\n\nSo, both options V and U are 9:3:3:1. Looking back, option V is written as 9,3,3,1, while option U is 3,9,3,1. So depending on the order of the phenotypes, option V is correct if the order is red-brown, red-palisade, palisade-brown, palisade-palisade.\n\nBut according to our analysis",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color, possible phenotypes are red or plain, and for body color, brown or checkered. Thus, four possible phenotypic combinations: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the expected phenotypic ratio in F2:\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC (all red), 50% Cc (some red, some plain?), wait no\u2014wait, for the C locus, the presence of the dominant allele (C) results in red, regardless of the B locus. Similarly, the B locus's presence (B) results in brown, regardless of the C locus. So the phenotype depends on whether either of the dominant alleles is present. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. Let's tabulate the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all possible genotypes for the F2 and determine their phenotypes:\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider the probability of each phenotype based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Alternatively, since each gene is independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. However, since each bird has two traits (pigment and color), the overall phenotypic ratio combines the effects of both genes.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the expected number of each phenotype by considering the genotypic ratios and then translating them into phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nFirst, calculate the proportion of each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- CC BB: 25%\nWait, no\u2014correctly, each of the four genotypic combinations occurs at 25% frequency in F2.\n\nSo now, for each genotype, what phenotype does it express?\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it is red.\n- If it has none (i.e., cc), it is plain.\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- If it has at least one B allele, it is brown.\n- If it has none (i.e., bb), it is checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of the two traits:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n\nWait, that seems too many. Actually, each bird has two separate traits, so the F2 phenotypic ratio can be computed by considering the possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to calculate the probability of each phenotype by looking at the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nEach gene has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), so for each trait, the probability is:\n\n- Pigment: 75% (since 25% are cc)\n- Color: 75% (since 25% are bb)\n\nHowever, since the two traits are independent, the combined probability is 75% * 75% = 56.25%, but this doesn't directly translate to the phenotypic ratio. Instead, we need to count the number of birds that exhibit each combination of traits.\n\nLet me make a table of all possible combinations and their probabilities:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (C and B):\n   - Pigment: C \u2192 red\n   - Color: B \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: red-brown\n   Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n2. Pigment dominant (C), color recessive (b):\n   - Red-brown\n   Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\n3. Pigment dominant (C), color dominant (B):\n   - Red-brown\n   Probability: same as above, 1/16\n\n4. Pigment dominant (C), color recessive (b):\n   - Red-checkered\n   Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\n5. Pigment recessive (cc), color dominant (B):\n   - Plain-brown\n   Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n6. Pigment recessive (cc), color recessive (bb):\n   - Plain-checkered\n   Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but this approach might not account for all combinations properly. Another way is to calculate the probability for each phenotype as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: red-brown (both C and B dominant)\nProbability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 2: red-checkered (C present, B absent)\nProbability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nPhenotype 3: plain-brown (C absent, B present)\nProbability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: plain-checkered (C absent, B absent)\nProbability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nAdding these up: 3+1+3+3=10 parts out of 16. That accounts for all possibilities.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:3:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match our calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (palisade) is when neither allele is dominant, i.e., recessive. So plain is palisade (c), and red is dominant (C). Brown is dominant (B).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can also be thought of as:\n\n- Both dominant: red-brown\n- Pigmented dominant, colored recessive: red-palisade\n- Pigmented recessive, colored dominant: palisade-brown\n- Both recessive: palisade-palisade\n\nBut according to standard classification, checkered (palisade) is when neither allele is dominant, so that's plain.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\nIn genetics, the term \"checkered\" refers to the absence of the dominant allele, resulting in a palisade (checkered) appearance. So:\n\n- C/B: red-brown\n- C/b: red-palisade\n- cb/B: palisade-brown\n- cb/bb: palisade-palisade\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Red-palisade (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Palisade-brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Palisade-palisade (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Red-brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n2. Red-palisade: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n3. Palisade-brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n4. Palisade-palisade: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSo adding these up: 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 3:1:3:9.\n\nWait, but in the options given, option G is: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit. Option J is: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For the C gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. For the B gene, the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele is present for each gene.\n\nSo, for the C gene:\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits.\n\nTo find the probabilities:\n\nThe chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is:\n\n- For C: 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- For B: 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for having both dominant alleles (red-brown).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only C dominant (and B recessive) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nOnly B dominant (and C recessive): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nNeither dominant (C and B recessive): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to red-brown : red-palisade : palisade-brown : palisade-palisade.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:0\n\nB. 8:4:0\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:0:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nK. 4:4:4:4\n\nL. 9:3:3:1\n\nM. 12:2:2:0\n\nN. 5:3:2:6\n\nO. 3:9:1:3\n\nP. 4:4:4:4\n\nQ. 2:6:3:1\n\nR. 1:1:1:1\n\nS. 3:1:1:3\n\nT. 1:3:9:3\n\nU. 3:9:3:1\n\nV. 9:3:3:1\n\nW. 1:3:9:3\n\nX. 3:1:1:3\n\nY. 1:2:2:1\n\nZ. 2:4:4:2\n\nThese don't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the phenotypic ratio refers to the number of birds rather than the ratio of phenotypes. Let me see.\n\nIf the F2 generation has 16 birds (since F2 is a dihybrid cross, which typically results in 9:3:3:1, summing to 16), then the phenotypic counts would be 9 red-brown, 3 red-palisade, 3 palisade-brown, and 1 palisade-palisade.\n\nBut the options don't include this exact ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, option L is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but inverted. Option V is 9:3:3:1, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo, if the F2 has 16 birds, the counts would be 9 red-brown, 3 red-palisade, 3 palisade-brown, and 1 palisade-palisade. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option L.\n\nBut looking back, the options provided are A to Z, with each being a specific ratio. Option L is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio refers to the number of each type without considering dominance, but that doesn't align with standard classification.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is option L: 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But according to our calculation, the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: The checkered pattern involves a dominant gene C, which controls pigment color, and the plain involves recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by B, and brown by b. So, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- Checkered (palisade) = both alleles recessive (c and c)\n- Plain (black) = both alleles dominant (C and C)\n- Checkered (palisade) could also refer to the color, but in this context, it's probably referring to the presence of the recessive allele for color.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify the terminology:\n\n- Checkered (palisade) is when neither allele is dominant, i.e., recessive.\n- Plain is when both alleles are dominant (for the other trait, say, color).\n\nWait, but the problem states:\n\nRed color is controlled by B (dominant), brown by b (recessive).\nCheckered control by C (dominant), plain by recessive.\n\nSo, for each trait, checkered is dominant (C), plain is recessive (c).\n\nFor the coat color, red is dominant (B), brown is recessive (b).\n\nSo, the four phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both traits:\n\n1. Both dominant: red-brown\n2. Pigmented dominant, colored recessive: red-palisade\n3. Pigmented recessive, colored dominant: palisade-brown\n4. Both recessive: palisade-palisade\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n1. Both dominant: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigmented dominant, recessive color: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n3. Pigmented recessive, dominant color: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option L (if L is 3:9:1:3), but that's inverted. Alternatively, option V is 9:3:3:1, which matches.\n\nGiven the options provided, option V (9:3:3:1) is available, but looking at the user's choices, option L is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1. However, option V is present. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write 9:3:3:1 as option L, but that's not how it's presented.\n\nWait, let me look again at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Reversed.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal, which would imply 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Reversed.\n\nM. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nN. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nO. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches.\n\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nQ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nR. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nS. 3,1,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nT. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nU. 3,9,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nV. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nW. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nX. 3,1,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nY. 1,2,2,1 \u2192 No.\n\nZ. 2,4,4,2 \u2192 No.\n\nSo, both options V and U are 9:3:3:1. Looking back, option V is written as 9,3,3,1, while option U is 3,9,3,1. So depending on the order of the phenotypes, option V is correct if the order is red-brown, red-palisade, palisade-brown, palisade-palisade.\n\nBut according to our analysis",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the four possible phenotypic categories are:",
    "rollout": " So the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur at different frequencies depending on the dominance of the alleles. Since the parents are homozygous, all F2 individuals will be CcBb, meaning for each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele being passed on. So the probability of each phenotype can be calculated.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (red) \u2192 50%\n- Absence of C (plain) \u2192 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (brown) \u2192 50%\n- Absence of B (checkered) \u2192 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red AND body brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red AND body checkered = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain AND body brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain AND body checkered = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, which makes sense. So the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit our calculation where each phenotype is 25%.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I missed something regarding dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves epistasis or some other interaction between the genes, but the question doesn't mention any such complexities. It simply states the dominance relations, so I shouldn't consider epistatic interactions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. In any case, according to my analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. However, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it to ensure I understood correctly.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, given the dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. From the options, option G seems to have a 12:2:2:0 ratio, which sums to 16, but that doesn't align with the 1:1:1:1 expectation unless the phenotypic categories are defined differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem considers only certain phenotypes as distinct. For example, if \"checkered\" implies that both genes are recessive, then the checkered phenotype might refer to having both c and b alleles, regardless of their dominance. But in reality, the checkered phenotype isn't typically expressed in dihybrids; it's more of a genetic term used in this context to denote the combination of both recessive alleles.\n\nIn that case, the checkered phenotype would correspond to the genotype cc bb. Similarly, the plain phenotype would be CC BB. The brown phenotype would be CC Bb (since B is dominant over b), and the red phenotype would be cc Bb. So the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. Checkered (cc bb): 25%\n2. Plain (CC BB): 25%\n3. Brown (CC Bb): 25%\n4. Red (cc Bb): 25%\n\nBut again, this still results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Looking back at the options, none directly match this. Option D suggests a different distribution, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of birds rather than the proportion, but the options seem to represent counts, not percentages.\n\nIf we take the F2 population size as a sample, say 16 birds, then each phenotype would occur 4 times. But the options don't provide such numbers. Instead, the options are giving counts like 6, 2, etc., which sum to 12, but that contradicts the expected 16.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Punnett square creation. Let me try creating the Punnett square properly. The parents are CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2).\n\nParent 1 can only produce CB gametes (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2 can only produce cb gametes (since both alleles are recessive).\n\nThus, all F1 would be CcBb, and their gametes would be CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. However, due to the law of independent assortment, the actual F2 will have a 25% chance for each combination, resulting in four phenotypes each occurring at 25% frequency.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided do not include this. This suggests either a misunderstanding in the problem setup or a miscalculation. Given that, I'll revisit the problem statement to ensure accuracy.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. The user wrote:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nYes, that's correct. Both parents are homozygous for their respective genes. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven this, none of the options match except perhaps option D, but that doesn't align with the expected 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio in terms of phenotypic classes without considering dominance, but that would lead to a different outcome.\n\nAnother angle: If the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype instead of proportions, then with 16 F2 birds, each phenotype would occur 4 times. But the options suggest different numbers, e.g., option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc., totaling 7, which is inconsistent with 16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as assuming that only certain alleles are expressed, leading to fewer phenotypes. For instance, if the checkered phenotype requires both recessive alleles (cc bb), and the others express differently, then the phenotypic ratios could be adjusted accordingly.\n\nHowever, without specific instructions on how to adjust for dominance or epistasis, the standard Mendelian approach applies, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the closest matching option among the provided choices, even if it doesn't perfectly align with the theoretical calculation. Among the options, option D suggests a checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), and plain brown (3). This totals 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the expected 16 birds in F2. However, this distribution doesn't follow the simple Mendelian 1:1:1:1 ratio but instead shows a different proportionality.\n\nWait, but why would the checkered phenotype appear three times as frequent as the plain red? That seems inconsistent with the 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the options or the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to consider only certain phenotypes as separate, but without dominance, leading to different ratios. However, given the standard dihybrid analysis, the correct approach leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't represented in the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer was option D, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user presented the options incorrectly. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the intended answer is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur at different frequencies depending on the dominance of the alleles. Since the parents are homozygous, all F2 individuals will be CcBb, meaning for each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele being passed on. So the probability of each phenotype can be calculated.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (red) \u2192 50%\n- Absence of C (plain) \u2192 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (brown) \u2192 50%\n- Absence of B (checkered) \u2192 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red AND body brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red AND body checkered = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain AND body brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain AND body checkered = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, which makes sense. So the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit our calculation where each phenotype is 25%.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I missed something regarding dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves epistasis or some other interaction between the genes, but the question doesn't mention any such complexities. It simply states the dominance relations, so I shouldn't consider epistatic interactions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. In any case, according to my analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. However, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it to ensure I understood correctly.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, given the dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. From the options, option G seems to have a 12:2:2:0 ratio, which sums to 16, but that doesn't align with the 1:1:1:1 expectation unless the phenotypic categories are defined differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem considers only certain phenotypes as distinct. For example, if \"checkered\" implies that both genes are recessive, then the checkered phenotype might refer to having both c and b alleles, regardless of their dominance. But in reality, the checkered phenotype isn't typically expressed in dihybrids; it's more of a genetic term used in this context to denote the combination of both recessive alleles.\n\nIn that case, the checkered phenotype would correspond to the genotype cc bb. Similarly, the plain phenotype would be CC BB. The brown phenotype would be CC Bb (since B is dominant over b), and the red phenotype would be cc Bb. So the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. Checkered (cc bb): 25%\n2. Plain (CC BB): 25%\n3. Brown (CC Bb): 25%\n4. Red (cc Bb): 25%\n\nBut again, this still results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Looking back at the options, none directly match this. Option D suggests a different distribution, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of birds rather than the proportion, but the options seem to represent counts, not percentages.\n\nIf we take the F2 population size as a sample, say 16 birds, then each phenotype would occur 4 times. But the options don't provide such numbers. Instead, the options are giving counts like 6, 2, etc., which sum to 12, but that contradicts the expected 16.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Punnett square creation. Let me try creating the Punnett square properly. The parents are CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2).\n\nParent 1 can only produce CB gametes (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2 can only produce cb gametes (since both alleles are recessive).\n\nThus, all F1 would be CcBb, and their gametes would be CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. However, due to the law of independent assortment, the actual F2 will have a 25% chance for each combination, resulting in four phenotypes each occurring at 25% frequency.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided do not include this. This suggests either a misunderstanding in the problem setup or a miscalculation. Given that, I'll revisit the problem statement to ensure accuracy.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. The user wrote:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nYes, that's correct. Both parents are homozygous for their respective genes. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven this, none of the options match except perhaps option D, but that doesn't align with the expected 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio in terms of phenotypic classes without considering dominance, but that would lead to a different outcome.\n\nAnother angle: If the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype instead of proportions, then with 16 F2 birds, each phenotype would occur 4 times. But the options suggest different numbers, e.g., option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc., totaling 7, which is inconsistent with 16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as assuming that only certain alleles are expressed, leading to fewer phenotypes. For instance, if the checkered phenotype requires both recessive alleles (cc bb), and the others express differently, then the phenotypic ratios could be adjusted accordingly.\n\nHowever, without specific instructions on how to adjust for dominance or epistasis, the standard Mendelian approach applies, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the closest matching option among the provided choices, even if it doesn't perfectly align with the theoretical calculation. Among the options, option D suggests a checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), and plain brown (3). This totals 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the expected 16 birds in F2. However, this distribution doesn't follow the simple Mendelian 1:1:1:1 ratio but instead shows a different proportionality.\n\nWait, but why would the checkered phenotype appear three times as frequent as the plain red? That seems inconsistent with the 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the options or the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to consider only certain phenotypes as separate, but without dominance, leading to different ratios. However, given the standard dihybrid analysis, the correct approach leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't represented in the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer was option D, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user presented the options incorrectly. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the intended answer is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The phenotypic ratios would then depend on how many individuals have each phenotype.",
    "rollout": " The phenotypic ratios would then depend on how many individuals have each phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to determine the possible phenotypes from the F2 generation. Let's consider the phenotypic traits:\n\nEach bird can be classified based on the presence of C (red) or c (plain) and the presence of B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B)\n2. Checkered brown (C and b)\n3. Plain red (c and B)\n4. Plain brown (c and b)\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red): probability = 3/4 (since each gamete has a 50% chance of giving C or c, and in F2, the distribution is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, so the chance of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4)\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct. For a single gene with two alleles, where the dominant allele is present, the probability of being heterozygous (at least one dominant allele) is 3/4, and homozygous dominant is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus, presence of B (brown) is 3/4, and absence is 1/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (c and B):\n\n- Probability of c (from cc): 1/4 (since cc is 25%)\n- Probability of B (from BB or Bb): 3/4 (since BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, bb is 25%, so B is present in 3/4)\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, for the C locus, the presence of c is 1/4 (from cc), and for the B locus, presence of B is 3/4 (from BB, Bb, Bb). So the combined probability for checkered red (c and B) is indeed (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\n2. Checkered brown (c and b):\n\n- Probability of c: 1/4\n- Probability of b: 1/4 (since bb is 25%)\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (C and b):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4 (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%, so C is present in 3/4)\n- Probability of b: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (C and B):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4\n- Probability of B: 3/4\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\n3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 1 : 3 : 9\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nThat doesn't match our calculation. Option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 that seems off because 1+3+9+3=16, which is correct, but the numbers don't align with our 3:1:3:9 ratio. Wait, no\u2014the user might have presented the options differently. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled up. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-express the probabilities without fractions:\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (for example, C or B) and 1/4 chance of being absent (c or b). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB):\n   - c: 1/4\n   - B: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (cb):\n   - c: 1/4\n   - b: 1/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (Cc):\n   - C: 3/4\n   - b: 1/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (CC):\n   - C: 3/4\n   - B: 3/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1:3:9. Looking at the options, none seem to directly state this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions given are A to H, each with different ratios. None of them matches exactly 3:1:3:9. Hmm. Maybe I misread the options. Let me see:\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nNo, that's 3:9:1:3, which is different.\n\nOption G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nNope, those add up to 16, but the ratio isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the options were scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's when considering all possible combinations. However, since each bird's phenotype depends on two independent traits, the actual phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:3:1 for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a single trait. For two traits, the phenotypic ratio combines both. In our case, we found 3:1:3:9, which sums to 16 parts. So the ratios are 3:1:3:9.\n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps option E is 3:9:1:3, which is a permutation of the same numbers, but ordered differently. If option E had checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, and plain brown as 3, that would be 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16. But according to our calculations, it's 3:1:3:9. So none of the options match exactly. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore dominance and count all combinations equally. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we assume that each phenotype category is equally likely regardless of dominance, then the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 4:4:4:4. That would mean each phenotype has 4 parts out of 16. But that doesn't fit any of the options either. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the initial Punnett square creation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, c recessive)\n- 25% cc (both recessive)\n- 25% bb (b recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C/C)\n- 25% Cc (C/c)\n- 25% cc (c/c)\n- 25% bb (b/b)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- C is dominant, so CC and Cc become red.\n- c is recessive, so cc becomes plain.\n- B is dominant, so BB and Bb become brown.\n- b is recessive, so bb becomes checkered.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes based on genotype:\n\n- CC/BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC/Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- Cc/BB \u2192 plain red\n- Cc/Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc/BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc/Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc/bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc/bb \u2192 checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% bb (brown)\n\nBut when considering dominance, the phenotypes for each trait:\n\n- For C: 25% CC (red), 25% Cc (red), 25% cc (plain)\n- For B: 25% BB (brown), 25% Bb (brown), 25% bb (checkered)\n\nHowever, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So each bird's phenotype is a combination:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 brown-red\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 brown-checkered\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 plain-red\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- cc/BB \u2192 brown-checkered\n- cc/Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- bb: brown\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- Red: C present (CC, Cc)\n- Brown: B present (BB, Bb)\n- Plain: c present (cc)\n- Checkered: b present (bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of presence or absence of C and B. Thus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 brown-red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 brown-checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-red\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each class in the F2 population.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% cc/BB \u2192 brown-checkered\n- 25% cc/Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- 25% cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- 25% cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, aggregating:\n\n- Brown-red: 4/8 = 1/2 (25% + 25% + 25% + 25%) = 4/16\nWait, actually, 4 instances of brown-red out of 16 possible, so 4/16 = 1/4\n- Brown-checkered: 2 instances (cc/BB and cc/Bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-red: 2 instances (cc/bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-checkered: 2 instances (cc/bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 = 10/16, which exceeds 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. The correct way is to realize that some genotypes correspond to the same phenotype. For example, CC/BB, CC/Bb, Cc/BB, Cc/Bb all result in brown-red. Similarly, cc/BB, cc/Bb result in brown-checkered, and the remaining result in plain-checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown-red: 4 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 4/16 = 1/4\n- Brown-checkered: 2 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-red: 2 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-checkered: 2 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n\nAdding these up: 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 + 3/8 = 5/8. Wait, that still doesn't add up to 1. I must be missing something. Let's recount:\n\nEach F2 bird has a genotype, and thus a phenotype. There are 16 possible genotypes (since F2 has 4 alleles, but each bird has 2, so 16 combinations). Let's list them:\n\n1. CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n2. CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n3. Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n4. Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n5. cc/BB \u2192 brown-checkered\n6. cc/Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n7. cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n8. cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, 4 out of 16 are brown-red, 2 are brown-checkered, 2 are plain-red, and 2 are plain-checkered. That makes sense.\n\nNow, converting to phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Brown-red: 4/16 = 1/4\n- Brown-checkered: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-red: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-checkered: 2/16 = 1/8\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:2, which simplifies to 2:1:1:1 when considering the number of birds with each phenotype.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them directly reflect this. The closest is option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". That's 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Another option is option H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which also sums to 16 but has different ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the F1 selfing, but perhaps it's referring to the F2 generation after a different approach, like a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds, not F1 selfing. That could change things significantly.\n\nAssuming the F2 comes from crossing two F1 birds (CcBb x CcBb), the possible genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant)\n- 25% cc (c recessive)\n- 25% BB (B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (B dominant)\n- 25% bb (b recessive)\n- 25% bb (b recessive)\n\nApplying dominance:\n\n- C present (C) \u2192 red\n- B present (B) \u2192 brown\n- c present (c) \u2192 plain\n- b present (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThe phenotypic combinations would now be based on the presence of C, B, c, and b. This complicates things because the F2 genotypes are now a mix of all possible combinations. Calculating the exact phenotypic ratios requires considering all combinations.\n\nTo simplify, let's map each F2 genotype to its corresponding phenotype:\n\n1. CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The phenotypic ratios would then depend on how many individuals have each phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to determine the possible phenotypes from the F2 generation. Let's consider the phenotypic traits:\n\nEach bird can be classified based on the presence of C (red) or c (plain) and the presence of B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B)\n2. Checkered brown (C and b)\n3. Plain red (c and B)\n4. Plain brown (c and b)\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red): probability = 3/4 (since each gamete has a 50% chance of giving C or c, and in F2, the distribution is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, so the chance of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4)\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct. For a single gene with two alleles, where the dominant allele is present, the probability of being heterozygous (at least one dominant allele) is 3/4, and homozygous dominant is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus, presence of B (brown) is 3/4, and absence is 1/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (c and B):\n\n- Probability of c (from cc): 1/4 (since cc is 25%)\n- Probability of B (from BB or Bb): 3/4 (since BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, bb is 25%, so B is present in 3/4)\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, for the C locus, the presence of c is 1/4 (from cc), and for the B locus, presence of B is 3/4 (from BB, Bb, Bb). So the combined probability for checkered red (c and B) is indeed (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\n2. Checkered brown (c and b):\n\n- Probability of c: 1/4\n- Probability of b: 1/4 (since bb is 25%)\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (C and b):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4 (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%, so C is present in 3/4)\n- Probability of b: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (C and B):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4\n- Probability of B: 3/4\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\n3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 1 : 3 : 9\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nThat doesn't match our calculation. Option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 that seems off because 1+3+9+3=16, which is correct, but the numbers don't align with our 3:1:3:9 ratio. Wait, no\u2014the user might have presented the options differently. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled up. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-express the probabilities without fractions:\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (for example, C or B) and 1/4 chance of being absent (c or b). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB):\n   - c: 1/4\n   - B: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (cb):\n   - c: 1/4\n   - b: 1/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (Cc):\n   - C: 3/4\n   - b: 1/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (CC):\n   - C: 3/4\n   - B: 3/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1:3:9. Looking at the options, none seem to directly state this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions given are A to H, each with different ratios. None of them matches exactly 3:1:3:9. Hmm. Maybe I misread the options. Let me see:\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nNo, that's 3:9:1:3, which is different.\n\nOption G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nNope, those add up to 16, but the ratio isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the options were scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's when considering all possible combinations. However, since each bird's phenotype depends on two independent traits, the actual phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:3:1 for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a single trait. For two traits, the phenotypic ratio combines both. In our case, we found 3:1:3:9, which sums to 16 parts. So the ratios are 3:1:3:9.\n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps option E is 3:9:1:3, which is a permutation of the same numbers, but ordered differently. If option E had checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, and plain brown as 3, that would be 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16. But according to our calculations, it's 3:1:3:9. So none of the options match exactly. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore dominance and count all combinations equally. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we assume that each phenotype category is equally likely regardless of dominance, then the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 4:4:4:4. That would mean each phenotype has 4 parts out of 16. But that doesn't fit any of the options either. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the initial Punnett square creation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, c recessive)\n- 25% cc (both recessive)\n- 25% bb (b recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C/C)\n- 25% Cc (C/c)\n- 25% cc (c/c)\n- 25% bb (b/b)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- C is dominant, so CC and Cc become red.\n- c is recessive, so cc becomes plain.\n- B is dominant, so BB and Bb become brown.\n- b is recessive, so bb becomes checkered.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes based on genotype:\n\n- CC/BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC/Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- Cc/BB \u2192 plain red\n- Cc/Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc/BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc/Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc/bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc/bb \u2192 checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% bb (brown)\n\nBut when considering dominance, the phenotypes for each trait:\n\n- For C: 25% CC (red), 25% Cc (red), 25% cc (plain)\n- For B: 25% BB (brown), 25% Bb (brown), 25% bb (checkered)\n\nHowever, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So each bird's phenotype is a combination:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 brown-red\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 brown-checkered\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 plain-red\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- cc/BB \u2192 brown-checkered\n- cc/Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- bb: brown\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- Red: C present (CC, Cc)\n- Brown: B present (BB, Bb)\n- Plain: c present (cc)\n- Checkered: b present (bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of presence or absence of C and B. Thus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 brown-red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 brown-checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-red\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each class in the F2 population.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n- 25% cc/BB \u2192 brown-checkered\n- 25% cc/Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- 25% cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- 25% cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, aggregating:\n\n- Brown-red: 4/8 = 1/2 (25% + 25% + 25% + 25%) = 4/16\nWait, actually, 4 instances of brown-red out of 16 possible, so 4/16 = 1/4\n- Brown-checkered: 2 instances (cc/BB and cc/Bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-red: 2 instances (cc/bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-checkered: 2 instances (cc/bb) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 = 10/16, which exceeds 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. The correct way is to realize that some genotypes correspond to the same phenotype. For example, CC/BB, CC/Bb, Cc/BB, Cc/Bb all result in brown-red. Similarly, cc/BB, cc/Bb result in brown-checkered, and the remaining result in plain-checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown-red: 4 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 4/16 = 1/4\n- Brown-checkered: 2 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-red: 2 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-checkered: 2 genotypes (25% each) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n\nAdding these up: 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 + 3/8 = 5/8. Wait, that still doesn't add up to 1. I must be missing something. Let's recount:\n\nEach F2 bird has a genotype, and thus a phenotype. There are 16 possible genotypes (since F2 has 4 alleles, but each bird has 2, so 16 combinations). Let's list them:\n\n1. CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n2. CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n3. Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n4. Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n5. cc/BB \u2192 brown-checkered\n6. cc/Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n7. cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n8. cc/bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, 4 out of 16 are brown-red, 2 are brown-checkered, 2 are plain-red, and 2 are plain-checkered. That makes sense.\n\nNow, converting to phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Brown-red: 4/16 = 1/4\n- Brown-checkered: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-red: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain-checkered: 2/16 = 1/8\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:2, which simplifies to 2:1:1:1 when considering the number of birds with each phenotype.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them directly reflect this. The closest is option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". That's 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Another option is option H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which also sums to 16 but has different ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the F1 selfing, but perhaps it's referring to the F2 generation after a different approach, like a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds, not F1 selfing. That could change things significantly.\n\nAssuming the F2 comes from crossing two F1 birds (CcBb x CcBb), the possible genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant)\n- 25% cc (c recessive)\n- 25% BB (B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (B dominant)\n- 25% bb (b recessive)\n- 25% bb (b recessive)\n\nApplying dominance:\n\n- C present (C) \u2192 red\n- B present (B) \u2192 brown\n- c present (c) \u2192 plain\n- b present (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThe phenotypic combinations would now be based on the presence of C, B, c, and b. This complicates things because the F2 genotypes are now a mix of all possible combinations. Calculating the exact phenotypic ratios requires considering all combinations.\n\nTo simplify, let's map each F2 genotype to its corresponding phenotype:\n\n1. CC/BB \u2192 brown-red\n2. CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n3. Cc/BB \u2192 brown-red\n4. Cc/Bb \u2192 brown-red\n5. CC/Bb \u2192 brown-red (wait, no\u2014this is a typo; it should be Cc/Bb)\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused. Let's create a table:\n\nF2 Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC/BB | brown-red\nCC/Bb | brown-red\nCc/BB | brown-red\nCc/Bb | brown-red\ncc/BB | brown-checkered\ncc/Bb | brown-checkered\ncc/bb | plain-checkered\ncc/bb | plain-checkered\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Brown-red: 4 cases (CC/BB, CC/Bb, Cc/BB, Cc/Bb) \u2192 4/16\n- Brown-checkered: 2 cases (cc/BB, cc/Bb) \u2192 2/16\n- Plain-red: 2 cases (cc/bb) \u2192 2/16\n- Plain-checkered: 2 cases (cc/bb) \u2192 2/16\n\nSo, the ratio is 4:2:2:2, or simplified 2:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match this. However, option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which is 3:9:1:3. That's a different ratio. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which sums to 16 but has a different ratio. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which is 1:3:9:3, which is a ratio that fits the 3",

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Instead, the options suggest different ratios, such as 6,2, etc., implying fewer classes. Maybe the problem assumes that only certain phenotypes are expressed, especially considering dominance. Let me approach this differently. For each bird, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird shows the most extreme phenotype. Let's consider the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (c and b): Both recessive alleles present, so both genes are recessive.\n2. Checkered and Red (c and B): c is recessive, B is dominant.\n3. Plain and Brown (C and b): C is dominant, b is recessive.\n4. Plain and Red (C and B): Both C and B are dominant.\n\nBut wait, since the presence of a dominant allele in either gene results in that trait being expressed. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Let's calculate the number of phenotypes and their ratios.\n\nEach bird can be classified into four possible phenotypic categories based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles:\n\n1.

To do this, we'll use the Punnett square approach. Since we're dealing with two genes, each with two alleles, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (dominant)\n- Cc (heterozygous)\n- cc (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n- BB (dominant)\n- Bb (heterozygous)\n- bb (recessive)\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So, the F2 genotypes for each gene will follow Mendelian ratios: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for Gene C; and similarly for Gene B.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are assorting independently, the combined phenotypes are determined by the product of the individual probabilities. Let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible combinations of the two genes:\n\n- C_B_: Probability = (Probability of C_) * (Probability of B_)\n  - Probability of C_: 1/4 (since C_ can be CC or Cc, which is 3/4 probability)\n  - Probability of B_: 1/4 (since B_ can be BB or Bb, which is 3/4 probability)\n  - Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- C_bb: Probability = (Probability of C_) * (Probability of bb)\n  - (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- ccBB: Probability = (Probability of cc) * (Probability of B_)\n  - (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- ccbb: Probability = (Probability of cc) * (Probability of bb)\n  - (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo, the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1, summing to 16 parts. Dividing each by 16 gives the proportion for each phenotype.\n\nNow, applying this to the actual counts:\n\nTotal F2 population = 16 parts, so let's assume 16 birds for simplicity.\n\nPhenotype Counts:\n1. Checkered-Brown: 9 birds\n2. Checkered-Red: 3 birds\n3. Plain-Brown: 3 birds\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

    "rollout": " However, since the presence of one trait doesn't affect the others, the number of phenotypes depends on the number of combinations of dominant/recessive states.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird will express both traits based on the alleles present.

C (red) and B (brown): Checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): Plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): Checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): Plain brown\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine this, we need to calculate how many individuals will exhibit each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nSince the F2 generation results from a selfing of the F1 generation (which was all CcBb), the F2 will follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C (p = probability of C, q = probability of c):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the allele distribution is 50% C and 50% c. Upon selfing, the frequency of each allele remains 50%, so the proportion of C in the next generation is 25%, C/C (homozygous red), 50% Cc (heterozygous red), and 25% cc (homozygous plain). Similarly, for Gene B (p = probability of B, q = probability of b):\n\nSame logic applies. Now, the combined effect of both genes leads to the following phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach gene contributes a factor to the overall ratio. Since both genes are acting independently, the total phenotypic ratios are the product of the individual ratios. That is, for each combination of the two traits, the ratio is (proportion of C) * (proportion of B).\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): 0.25 (C) * 0.25 (B) = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n\nNow, adding up all percentages: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown =\n\n6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nDivide all by 6.25 \u2192 1 : 3 : 3 : 9\n\nBut looking back at the options, let me see what the answer choices are. The options given are A through J, with various ratios. Let me look at option D: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Hmm, that seems like 1:3:9:3, which matches our calculation. Alternatively, another way to write this ratio is 1:3:3:9, but depending on how it's presented.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes ratios are written as 1:3:9:3, where the sum is 16 parts. So, the percentage breakdown is:\n\nCheckered red: 1 part \u2192 6.25%\n\nCheckered brown: 3 parts \u2192 18.75%\n\nPlain red: 3 parts \u2192 18.75%\n\nPlain brown: 9 parts \u2192 56.25%\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. However, since the presence of one trait doesn't affect the others, the number of phenotypes depends on the number of combinations of dominant/recessive states.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird will express both traits based on the alleles present. So for the C locus, each bird will either have C (red) or c (plain). For the B locus, each bird will either have B (brown) or b (checkered). Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): Checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): Plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): Checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): Plain brown\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine this, we need to calculate how many individuals will exhibit each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nSince the F2 generation results from a selfing of the F1 generation (which was all CcBb), the F2 will follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C (p = probability of C, q = probability of c):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the allele distribution is 50% C and 50% c. Upon selfing, the frequency of each allele remains 50%, so the proportion of C in the next generation is 25%, C/C (homozygous red), 50% Cc (heterozygous red), and 25% cc (homozygous plain). Similarly, for Gene B (p = probability of B, q = probability of b):\n\nSame logic applies. Now, the combined effect of both genes leads to the following phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach gene contributes a factor to the overall ratio. Since both genes are acting independently, the total phenotypic ratios are the product of the individual ratios. That is, for each combination of the two traits, the ratio is (proportion of C) * (proportion of B).\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): 0.25 (C) * 0.25 (B) = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n\nNow, adding up all percentages: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown =\n\n6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nDivide all by 6.25 \u2192 1 : 3 : 3 : 9\n\nBut looking back at the options, let me see what the answer choices are. The options given are A through J, with various ratios. Let me look at option D: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Hmm, that seems like 1:3:9:3, which matches our calculation. Alternatively, another way to write this ratio is 1:3:3:9, but depending on how it's presented.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes ratios are written as 1:3:9:3, where the sum is 16 parts. So, the percentage breakdown is:\n\nCheckered red: 1 part \u2192 6.25%\n\nCheckered brown: 3 parts \u2192 18.75%\n\nPlain red: 3 parts \u2192 18.75%\n\nPlain brown: 9 parts \u2192 56.25%\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Which aligns perfectly with our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let's calculate them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (Red) = 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Probability of c (Plain) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (Brown) = 75%\n- Probability of b (Checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo the four phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1.

Alternatively, since each phenotypic category represents a certain number of birds, we can express the ratio accordingly. Adding up all the probabilities: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match this calculation. Maybe the options are simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the original question considers only certain phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, another approach: If we consider each trait separately, the phenotypes could be categorized as follows:\n\n- If both traits are dominant (C and B): checkered red\n- If C dominant, B recessive: plain red\n- If C recessive, B dominant: checkered brown\n- If both recessive: plain brown\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype would then be:\n\n1. Both dominant: (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. C dominant, b (recessive B): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. c (recessive C), B dominant: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Both recessive: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up gives 100%, so the ratios are 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, we can multiply each by 16 to eliminate decimals: 56.25*16=900, 18.75*16=300, same for the others. So 900:300:300:6.25\u2192 but this seems messy.

Perhaps the confusion arises from whether the dihybrid cross is being considered as a simple two-generational cross (F2 from F1\u00d7F1) versus a different setup. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only one generation instead of the F2. Wait, let me double-check the question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So it's definitely F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the Punnett squares. Looking back, the user provided a detailed gamete list, but perhaps I misread it. Let me re-examine the provided gametes:\n\nGametes: (CB), (cb), (cB), (cb), (CB), (ccB), (cbb), (ccBB), (ccbb).\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. The F1 from CCBB \u00d7 ccbb should produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportion. So the gametes should be (CB) and (cb) each at 50%. But the provided gametes are (CB), (cb), (cB), (cb), (CB), (ccB), (cbb), (ccBB), (ccbb). That seems inconsistent\u2014it might have been a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nAssuming that the correct gametes are (CB) and (cb) each at 50%, then the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25% from CB + CB)\n- Cc (probability 50% from CB + cb)\n- cc (probability 25% from cb + cb)\n- bb (probability 25% from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these would then produce specific phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nSo for the C locus: \n- CC (red) and Cc (red) and cc (plain)\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (checkered)\n\nCombining these:\n\n1. CC (red) and BB (brown): red brown (checkered red)\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown): red brown (plain red)\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered): red checkered (plain red)\n4. Cc (red) and BB (brown): red brown (checkered red)\n5. Cc (red) and Bb (brown): red brown (plain red)\n6.

However, option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. But our calculation shows 3:3:2:2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the gametes, F1 is CcBb. F1 selfing produces:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\n\nEach of these combines with the B locus:\n\nFor each genotype, the B and b alleles determine the color.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\n1. CC (red) + BB (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC (red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 plain red\n3. CC (red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc (red) + BB (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n5.

Earlier I thought it was 3,3,2,2, but upon recounting, it's 3,4,4,4.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see my mistake now. The F2 phenotypes should be:\n\n- CC (red) and BB (brown): checkered red \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 25% of 10 birds \u2192 2.5, but since we can't have half birds, it's either 2 or 3.\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- CC (red) and bb (checkered): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- Cc (red) and BB (brown): checkered red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- Cc (red) and Bb (brown): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- Cc (red) and bb (checkered): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and BB (brown): checkered brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): checkered brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n\nBut adding up all the counts, considering the 10 birds:\n\nEach phenotype group (checkered red, plain red, etc.) appears in 25% of F2, which is approximately 2.5 birds. Since we can't have half a bird, in reality, it's either 2 or 3. But for the purposes of ratios, we can assume 3 for some and 2 for others, depending on the distribution.\n\nHowever, this complicates things. Instead, let's proceed with the assumption that the phenotypes are distributed as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 3)\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 3)\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 3)\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 2)\n\nThis leads to a ratio of approximately 3:3:3:2, but none of the options match this. However, looking at the options again, option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, sum 16. Option E is 3:9:3:1, sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood how many birds are in each phenotype. Let's count again properly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 5\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 6\n7. cc BB \u2192 checkered brown \u2192 7\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown \u2192 8\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown \u2192 9\n10. cc bb \u2192 plain brown \u2192 10\n\nSo, the actual counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain red: 2, 3, 5, 6 \u2192 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 8, 9 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain brown: 10 \u2192 1 bird\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:4:2:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none directly match this. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. Option K is 4:4:4:4, sum 16. Option L is 12:2:2:0, sum 16.\n\nOption C is 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which corresponds to a ratio where checkered red is 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1. This seems off compared to our actual counts of 3,4,2,1.\n\nOption A is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum 16. This implies 6,2,6,2. Our actual counts are 3,4,2,1, which isn't matching any option except possibly none.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: Consider the actual probabilities after squaring the gametes. Since each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Each of these will then combine with the B and b alleles.\n\nSo, for each genotype, the B and b will determine the color:\n\n- CC (red) x BB (brown): checkered red\n- CC (red) x Bb (brown): plain red\n- CC (red) x bb (checkered): plain red\n- Cc (red) x BB (brown): checkered red\n- Cc (red) x Bb (brown): plain red\n- Cc (red) x bb (checkered): plain red\n- cc (plain) x BB (brown): checkered brown\n- cc (plain) x Bb (brown): checkered brown\n- cc (plain) x bb (checkered): plain brown\n- cc (plain) x bb (checkered): plain brown\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 instances (from CC BB, Cc BB, and cc bb)\n- Plain red: 3 instances (from CC Bb, Cc Bb, and cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 instances (from CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain brown: 1 instance (from cc bb)\n\nWait, but that's 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, and 1 plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (C) Brown (B): checkered red\n2. Red (C) Checkered (b): plain red\n3. Plain (c) Brown (B): checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) Checkered (b): plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene. Let's calculate them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (Red) = 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Probability of c (Plain) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (Brown) = 75%\n- Probability of b (Checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo the four phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but the options given don't include decimal points, so we'll convert percentages to whole numbers where possible. Alternatively, since each phenotypic category represents a certain number of birds, we can express the ratio accordingly. Adding up all the probabilities: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match this calculation. Maybe the options are simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the original question considers only certain phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, another approach: If we consider each trait separately, the phenotypes could be categorized as follows:\n\n- If both traits are dominant (C and B): checkered red\n- If C dominant, B recessive: plain red\n- If C recessive, B dominant: checkered brown\n- If both recessive: plain brown\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype would then be:\n\n1. Both dominant: (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. C dominant, b (recessive B): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. c (recessive C), B dominant: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Both recessive: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up gives 100%, so the ratios are 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, we can multiply each by 16 to eliminate decimals: 56.25*16=900, 18.75*16=300, same for the others. So 900:300:300:6.25\u2192 but this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps the options are expressed without decimals, rounding to nearest whole numbers. Alternatively, maybe the options are presented differently.\n\nLooking at the answer choices provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 (checkered red: checkered brown: plain red: plain brown)\nB. 8:4:8:4 (different)\nC. 9:3:3:1 (summing up to 16)\nD. 1:3:9:3 (summing to 16)\nE. 3:9:3:1 (summing to 16)\nF. 4:4:4:4 (all equal)\nG. 12:2:2:0 (summing to 16)\nH. 5:3:2:6 (summing to 16)\nI. 7:5:1:3 (summing to 16)\nJ. 2:6:3:1 (summing to 12)\nK. 4:4:4:4 (same as F)\nL. 12:2:2:0 (same as G)\n\nHmm, none seem to perfectly align with our earlier calculations. Perhaps the confusion arises from whether the dihybrid cross is being considered as a simple two-generational cross (F2 from F1\u00d7F1) versus a different setup. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only one generation instead of the F2. Wait, let me double-check the question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So it's definitely F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the Punnett squares. Looking back, the user provided a detailed gamete list, but perhaps I misread it. Let me re-examine the provided gametes:\n\nGametes: (CB), (cb), (cB), (cb), (CB), (ccB), (cbb), (ccBB), (ccbb).\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. The F1 from CCBB \u00d7 ccbb should produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportion. So the gametes should be (CB) and (cb) each at 50%. But the provided gametes are (CB), (cb), (cB), (cb), (CB), (ccB), (cbb), (ccBB), (ccbb). That seems inconsistent\u2014it might have been a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nAssuming that the correct gametes are (CB) and (cb) each at 50%, then the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25% from CB + CB)\n- Cc (probability 50% from CB + cb)\n- cc (probability 25% from cb + cb)\n- bb (probability 25% from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these would then produce specific phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nSo for the C locus: \n- CC (red) and Cc (red) and cc (plain)\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (checkered)\n\nCombining these:\n\n1. CC (red) and BB (brown): red brown (checkered red)\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown): red brown (plain red)\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered): red checkered (plain red)\n4. Cc (red) and BB (brown): red brown (checkered red)\n5. Cc (red) and Bb (brown): red brown (plain red)\n6. Cc (red) and bb (checkered): red checkered (plain red)\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown): plain brown (checkered brown)\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown): plain brown (checkered brown)\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain checkered (plain brown)\n10. cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain checkered (plain brown)\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotypes 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain red: Phenotypes 4, 5, 6 \u2192 3 instances\n- Checkered brown: Phenotypes 7, 8 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain brown: Phenotypes 9, 10 \u2192 2 instances\n\nTotal of 10 F2 birds.\n\nNow, calculating the ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/10 \u2192 3:7 (if considering other ratios)\n- Plain red: 3/10 \u2192 3:7\n- Checkered brown: 2/10 \u2192 2:8\n- Plain brown: 2/10 \u2192 2:8\n\nSimplifying these fractions:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/10 \u2248 3:7\n- Plain red: 3/10 \u2248 3:7\n- Checkered brown: 2/10 = 1:4\n- Plain brown: 2/10 = 1:4\n\nBut none of the options match this exact breakdown. Let's look at the answer options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8:4:8:4 \u2192 sum 24\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3:9:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 sum 12\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 sum 16\nL. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 sum 16\n\nNone of these options exactly matches the 3:3:2:2 ratio. However, option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. But our calculation shows 3:3:2:2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the gametes, F1 is CcBb. F1 selfing produces:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\n\nEach of these combines with the B locus:\n\nFor each genotype, the B and b alleles determine the color.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\n1. CC (red) + BB (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC (red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 plain red\n3. CC (red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc (red) + BB (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc (red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 plain red\n6. Cc (red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n7. cc (plain) + BB (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n8. cc (plain) + Bb (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n9. cc (plain) + bb (checkered) \u2192 plain brown\n10. cc (plain) + bb (checkered) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- checkered red: Phenotypes 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- plain red: Phenotypes 2, 3, 6, 8 \u2192 4 cases\n- checkered brown: Phenotypes 5, 6, 9, 10 \u2192 4 cases\n- plain brown: Phenotypes 3, 7, 9, 10 \u2192 4 cases\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Earlier I thought it was 3,3,2,2, but upon recounting, it's 3,4,4,4.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see my mistake now. The F2 phenotypes should be:\n\n- CC (red) and BB (brown): checkered red \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 25% of 10 birds \u2192 2.5, but since we can't have half birds, it's either 2 or 3.\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- CC (red) and bb (checkered): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- Cc (red) and BB (brown): checkered red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- Cc (red) and Bb (brown): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- Cc (red) and bb (checkered): plain red \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and BB (brown): checkered brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): checkered brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain brown \u2192 25% \u2192 2 or 3\n\nBut adding up all the counts, considering the 10 birds:\n\nEach phenotype group (checkered red, plain red, etc.) appears in 25% of F2, which is approximately 2.5 birds. Since we can't have half a bird, in reality, it's either 2 or 3. But for the purposes of ratios, we can assume 3 for some and 2 for others, depending on the distribution.\n\nHowever, this complicates things. Instead, let's proceed with the assumption that the phenotypes are distributed as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 3)\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 3)\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 3)\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 2.5 (approximated to 2)\n\nThis leads to a ratio of approximately 3:3:3:2, but none of the options match this. However, looking at the options again, option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, sum 16. Option E is 3:9:3:1, sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood how many birds are in each phenotype. Let's count again properly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 5\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 6\n7. cc BB \u2192 checkered brown \u2192 7\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown \u2192 8\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown \u2192 9\n10. cc bb \u2192 plain brown \u2192 10\n\nSo, the actual counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain red: 2, 3, 5, 6 \u2192 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 8, 9 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain brown: 10 \u2192 1 bird\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:4:2:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none directly match this. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. Option K is 4:4:4:4, sum 16. Option L is 12:2:2:0, sum 16.\n\nOption C is 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which corresponds to a ratio where checkered red is 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1. This seems off compared to our actual counts of 3,4,2,1.\n\nOption A is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum 16. This implies 6,2,6,2. Our actual counts are 3,4,2,1, which isn't matching any option except possibly none.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: Consider the actual probabilities after squaring the gametes. Since each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Each of these will then combine with the B and b alleles.\n\nSo, for each genotype, the B and b will determine the color:\n\n- CC (red) x BB (brown): checkered red\n- CC (red) x Bb (brown): plain red\n- CC (red) x bb (checkered): plain red\n- Cc (red) x BB (brown): checkered red\n- Cc (red) x Bb (brown): plain red\n- Cc (red) x bb (checkered): plain red\n- cc (plain) x BB (brown): checkered brown\n- cc (plain) x Bb (brown): checkered brown\n- cc (plain) x bb (checkered): plain brown\n- cc (plain) x bb (checkered): plain brown\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 instances (from CC BB, Cc BB, and cc bb)\n- Plain red: 3 instances (from CC Bb, Cc Bb, and cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 instances (from CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain brown: 1 instance (from cc bb)\n\nWait, but that's 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, and 1 plain brown. Summing to 9 birds. Wait, but earlier I had 3,4,2,1. Hmm, inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the counts. Let me try again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 plain red \u2192 5\n6.

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, considering the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Presence (C) \u2192 2/3 (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c) \u2192 1/3\n\nWait, no. Wait, the C locus: C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is red. The c alleles make it plain. So for pigment color, the possible phenotypes are red (C present) or plain (c present). Similarly, for body color, B is dominant over b, so brown (B present) or checkered (b present).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are 2x2=4 phenotypes, each occurring at a certain probability. Specifically, the probability for each phenotype is (probability for C) * (probability for B). Let's calculate each:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n2.

Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is approximately 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to 4/9 red-brown, 2/9 red-checkered, 2/9 plain-brown, and 1/9 plain-checkered.\n\nBut the options given don't seem to match exactly, so let me see.

Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. Since each gene is dominant, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The number of possible phenotypic classes is indeed 2x2=4. The probabilities for each class are:\n\n- Both traits expressed (Red and Brown): (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9\n- Pigment expressed, body hidden (Red and Checkered): (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\n- Pigment hidden, body expressed (Plain and Brown): (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\n- Both traits hidden (Plain and Checkered): (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nThese sum to 1, as before. So the phenotypic ratios are 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16, which isn't right.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 generation's ratio after selfing once, starting from a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, maybe the user provided a different approach, but my calculation shows 4:2:2:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which doesn't fit. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the F2 refers to the cross between the F1 and another F1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 from a dihybrid cross where one parent is a dihybrid (like CcBB \u00d7 ccbb), but perhaps the user intended a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the F2 generation without proper Punnett squares, but I think I've done the correct analysis.\n\nGiven the options, the closest I got was 4:2:2:1, which isn't among the choices. However, looking back, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount the probabilities: \n\nThe probability of having the C allele (dominant) is 2/3, and B is also 2/3. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- C and B: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- C and b: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- c and B: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- c and b: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options match this exact ratio. However, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't make sense because the last category shouldn't be zero unless all individuals are plain, which isn't the case. Option H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Also not matching. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't add up. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16.

Option K: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes' effects. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider that the F2 generation refers to the cross between the F1 (which is CcBb) and itself, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But that would mean four phenotypic ratios, which isn't what the question asks for. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 generation resulting from a different cross, such as a dihybrid cross between two dihybrids, but the user might have meant something else.\n\nWait, going back to the user's question, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the dihybrid cross between two parents: one is CcBB (a heterozygote), and the other is ccbb (another heterozygote). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed. In that case, the possible phenotypes would still follow the 2:2:1:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 4:2:2:1 overall ratio. Still, none of the options match this. Perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about the F2 generation from a different cross. Let me re-examine the user's question. They said: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes affecting color and pigmentation: one for pigment (C) and one for body (B). The F2 generation would involve selfing the F1, which is CcBb. As previously, the phenotypic ratio remains 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants to know the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb), but then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed, leading to the same 4:2:2:1 ratio. If none of the options match, perhaps I need to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the wrong parents or the wrong genes. Let me double-check the setup.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nCross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb \u2192 F1 is CcBb\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 F2\n\nAs established, F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 \u2192 Checkered red: 4 parts, checkered brown: 2, plain red: 2, plain brown: 1.\n\nLooking at the options, none match exactly. However, option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option G: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Option I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option K: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 No.\n\nNone of the options sum to 16 except for some. Wait, option E has 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the total. Option G has 9+3+3+1=16. Options A, B, C, D, I, J, K don't sum to 16, except for E and G.\n\nHowever, the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is not among the options. But the closest match in terms of the sum being 16 is option E and G. Between them, 4:2:2:1 vs 9:3:3:1, neither perfectly matches. But perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the user is referring to the F2 generation from a different cross, such as a dihybrid cross between two different dihybrids, like CcBB \u00d7 CcBB, but the user didn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to a different scenario. Given the confusion, perhaps the best answer is to select the option that most closely matches the expected ratio, even if it's not perfect. Option E and G sum to 16, while others either sum incorrectly or don't match the ratio. Since the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which isn't an option, but option E has 3:9:1:3, which is 16, and option G has 9:3:3:1, which is also 16. Neither perfectly matches, but perhaps option E is closer in terms of proportion, though it's not exactly 4:2:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't reflect that. Without further clarification, I'll have to choose the option that aligns with the correct ratio, even if it's not perfect. Option E has a ratio that sums to 16, and option G also sums to 16. Since the user's options include both, and the correct ratio isn't present, perhaps the closest is option E, despite it being a bit off.\n\nBut wait, the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is approximately 4 parts checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Comparing to the options:\n\n- Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Closest numbers, but doesn't match exactly.\n- Option G: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Closer than E, but still not exact.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as considering only one gene, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment (C) and body (B). The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 RRBB/BbBb?\nWait, no, the letters represent the alleles. For pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is red. For body color, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown. The phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- Red and Brown: C and B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Red and Checkered: C and b \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain and Brown: c and B \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain and Checkered: c and b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nPhenotype 2: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nPhenotype 3: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nPhenotype 4: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nSumming these gives 1, as required.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which doesn't match any of the provided options exactly. However, option E has a ratio that sums to 16 and includes numbers close to the expected ratios. Option G has 9,3,3,1, which also sums to 16. Among these, option E's ratio is higher than expected for checkered red, whereas option G's ratio aligns better with the expected proportions. Since option E's sum is correct, but the actual ratio isn't present, perhaps the closest answer is option E. However, I'm uncertain because none of the options perfectly match the 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the user intended to provide the correct option, and upon reviewing, option E is the closest in terms of summing to 16, which is necessary for a valid Punnett square. Even though the specific ratios don't match, option E is likely the intended answer. Therefore, I'll go with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, considering the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Presence (C) \u2192 2/3 (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c) \u2192 1/3\n\nWait, no. Wait, the C locus: C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is red. The c alleles make it plain. So for pigment color, the possible phenotypes are red (C present) or plain (c present). Similarly, for body color, B is dominant over b, so brown (B present) or checkered (b present).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are 2x2=4 phenotypes, each occurring at a certain probability. Specifically, the probability for each phenotype is (probability for C) * (probability for B). Let's calculate each:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is approximately 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to 4/9 red-brown, 2/9 red-checkered, 2/9 plain-brown, and 1/9 plain-checkered.\n\nBut the options given don't seem to match exactly, so let me see. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 1 \u2013 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn\u2019t add up.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 This adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense.\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. Since each gene is dominant, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The number of possible phenotypic classes is indeed 2x2=4. The probabilities for each class are:\n\n- Both traits expressed (Red and Brown): (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9\n- Pigment expressed, body hidden (Red and Checkered): (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\n- Pigment hidden, body expressed (Plain and Brown): (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\n- Both traits hidden (Plain and Checkered): (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nThese sum to 1, as before. So the phenotypic ratios are 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16, which isn't right.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 generation's ratio after selfing once, starting from a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, maybe the user provided a different approach, but my calculation shows 4:2:2:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which doesn't fit. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the F2 refers to the cross between the F1 and another F1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 from a dihybrid cross where one parent is a dihybrid (like CcBB \u00d7 ccbb), but perhaps the user intended a different approach.

However, looking back, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount the probabilities: \n\nThe probability of having the C allele (dominant) is 2/3, and B is also 2/3. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- C and B: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- C and b: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- c and B: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- c and b: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options match this exact ratio. However, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't make sense because the last category shouldn't be zero unless all individuals are plain, which isn't the case. Option H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Also not matching. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't add up. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, doesn't fit. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't the case. Option I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Option K: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes' effects. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider that the F2 generation refers to the cross between the F1 (which is CcBb) and itself, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But that would mean four phenotypic ratios, which isn't what the question asks for. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 generation resulting from a different cross, such as a dihybrid cross between two dihybrids, but the user might have meant something else.\n\nWait, going back to the user's question, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the dihybrid cross between two parents: one is CcBB (a heterozygote), and the other is ccbb (another heterozygote). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed. In that case, the possible phenotypes would still follow the 2:2:1:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 4:2:2:1 overall ratio. Still, none of the options match this. Perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about the F2 generation from a different cross. Let me re-examine the user's question. They said: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes affecting color and pigmentation: one for pigment (C) and one for body (B). The F2 generation would involve selfing the F1, which is CcBb. As previously, the phenotypic ratio remains 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants to know the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb), but then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed, leading to the same 4:2:2:1 ratio. If none of the options match, perhaps I need to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the wrong parents or the wrong genes. Let me double-check the setup.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nCross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb \u2192 F1 is CcBb\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 F2\n\nAs established, F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 \u2192 Checkered red: 4 parts, checkered brown: 2, plain red: 2, plain brown: 1.\n\nLooking at the options, none match exactly. However, option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option G: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Option I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option K: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 No.\n\nNone of the options sum to 16 except for some. Wait, option E has 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the total. Option G has 9+3+3+1=16. Options A, B, C, D, I, J, K don't sum to 16, except for E and G.\n\nHowever, the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is not among the options. But the closest match in terms of the sum being 16 is option E and G. Between them, 4:2:2:1 vs 9:3:3:1, neither perfectly matches. But perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the user is referring to the F2 generation from a different cross, such as a dihybrid cross between two different dihybrids, like CcBB \u00d7 CcBB, but the user didn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to a different scenario. Given the confusion, perhaps the best answer is to select the option that most closely matches the expected ratio, even if it's not perfect. Option E and G sum to 16, while others either sum incorrectly or don't match the ratio. Since the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which isn't an option, but option E has 3:9:1:3, which is 16, and option G has 9:3:3:1, which is also 16. Neither perfectly matches, but perhaps option E is closer in terms of proportion, though it's not exactly 4:2:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't reflect that. Without further clarification, I'll have to choose the option that aligns with the correct ratio, even if it's not perfect. Option E has a ratio that sums to 16, and option G also sums to 16. Since the user's options include both, and the correct ratio isn't present, perhaps the closest is option E, despite it being a bit off.\n\nBut wait, the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is approximately 4 parts checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Comparing to the options:\n\n- Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Closest numbers, but doesn't match exactly.\n- Option G: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Closer than E, but still not exact.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as considering only one gene, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment (C) and body (B). The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 RRBB/BbBb?\nWait, no, the letters represent the alleles. For pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is red. For body color, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown. The phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- Red and Brown: C and B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Red and Checkered: C and b \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain and Brown: c and B \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain and Checkered: c and b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nPhenotype 2: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nPhenotype 3: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nPhenotype 4: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nSumming these gives 1, as required.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which doesn't match any of the provided options exactly. However, option E has a ratio that sums to 16 and includes numbers close to the expected ratios. Option G has 9,3,3,1, which also sums to 16. Among these, option E's ratio is higher than expected for checkered red, whereas option G's ratio aligns better with the expected proportions. Since option E's sum is correct, but the actual ratio isn't present, perhaps the closest answer is option E. However, I'm uncertain because none of the options perfectly match the 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the user intended to provide the correct option, and upon reviewing, option E is the closest in terms of summing to 16, which is necessary for a valid Punnett square. Even though the specific ratios don't match, option E is likely the intended answer. Therefore, I'll go with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotype can be:",
    "rollout": " So the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Red (C present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Red (C present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n3. Plain (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Plain (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, to determine how often each phenotype appears in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 100%\n- Absence (c): 50%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 100%\n- Absence (b): 50%\n\nSince both genes are present, the overall probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: 1 * 1 = 100% \u2192 checkered red\n- C present, B absent: 1 * 0 = 0% \u2192 checkered brown\n- C absent, B present: 0 * 1 = 0% \u2192 plain brown\n- C absent, B absent: 0 * 0 = 0% \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are required for each phenotype, then:\n\n- To be checkered red: must have C present and B present. Probability is 1 * 1 = 1 (or 100%).\n- To be checkered brown: must have C present but B absent. Probability is 1 * 0 = 0.\n- To be plain brown: must have C absent but B present. Probability is 0 * 1 = 0.\n- To be plain red: must have C absent and B absent. Probability is 0 * 0 = 0.\n\nBut this seems off because it suggests that only checkered red is ever expressed, which contradicts typical dihybrid crosses where all four phenotypes can exist. Maybe I made a mistake in considering dominance. Wait, in reality, both genes are acting, so the presence of either dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. But in this case, the dominant allele for pigment is C, and for body is B. So the presence of any dominant allele results in that trait being expressed.\n\nSo the actual phenotypes should be determined by whether each allele is dominant or recessive. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: C present and B present \u2192 100%\n2. Plain red: C present and B absent \u2192 0%\n3. Checkered brown: C absent and B present \u2192 0%\n4. Plain brown: C absent and B absent \u2192 0%\n\nBut that implies that only checkered red is ever observed, which doesn't align with standard dihybrid crosses where all four phenotypes are possible. Perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the presence of dominant alleles leads to those traits, but if both are present, it's one phenotype, and if either is missing, another. But according to the given problem statement, both genes are acting, so each bird must express both traits unless one is recessive.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured such that each gene contributes to the phenotype in a way that requires both dominant alleles to display both traits. So, for example, to exhibit both traits, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: C present and B present \u2192 100%\n- Checkered brown: C present and b present \u2192 0%\n- Plain red: c present and B present \u2192 0%\n- Plain brown: c present and b present \u2192 0%\n\nThis still doesn't explain why some phenotypes wouldn't occur. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied dominance. If C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, then the presence of C or B leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. However, if both are present, it might be a different phenotype. But according to the problem statement, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red (100%)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown (0%)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown (0%)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red (0%)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because standard dihybrid crosses usually result in four phenotypes. Maybe the problem is structured differently. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles leads to a specific phenotype regardless of the other gene. So, for example, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it displays both. Otherwise, it displays the other trait. That could lead to all four phenotypes being possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each trait is determined separately, so the presence of dominant alleles for pigment color leads to red, and for body color leads to brown. So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment is red, and a bird with at least one dominant allele for body is brown. Thus, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both traits present \u2192 Checkered red (100%)\n2. Pigment present, body absent \u2192 Checkered brown (0%)\n3. Pigment absent, body present \u2192 Plain brown (0%)\n4. Pigment absent, body absent \u2192 Plain red (0%)\n\nThat makes sense. So the phenotypic ratios would be 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red. But none of the answer options seem to match that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nThe options given are A through H, each providing a different phenotypic ratio. The user asked to select the correct option, and the assistant was supposed to provide the reasoning and then choose the letter. So, after analyzing, I realize that according to the problem description, only checkered red is ever observed because the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match my conclusion that only checkered red is expressed. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that red color is determined by the dominant gene C, and brown by B. So, the presence of any dominant allele for each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C present, B present) \u2192 100%\n2. Checkered brown (C present, b present) \u2192 0%\n3. Plain red (c present, B present) \u2192 0%\n4. Plain brown (c present, b present) \u2192 0%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red. None of the options reflect this exactly, but looking closer, perhaps the user intended that only the presence of dominant alleles for either trait leads to that phenotype, without requiring both. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that each bird can express only one trait based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, under standard Mendelian inheritance, this isn't the case because the expression depends on the presence of dominant alleles across multiple loci.\n\nGiven that, the most accurate phenotypic ratio is 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red. Looking at the options provided, this doesn't match any, suggesting a misunderstanding or error in the problem setup. However, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me reread it.\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown by B. Checkered is controlled by recessive alleles.\" Wait, hold on! The problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C,\" implying that C is responsible for red, while B is responsible for brown. Also, \"checkered is controlled by recessive alleles.\" So, the recessive allele for pigment color (c) and the recessive allele for body color (b) combine to make the bird checkered.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both pigment and body are red (C and B present): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present), body brown (B absent): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c present), body red (B absent): Plain red\n4. Pigment plain (c present), body brown (b present): Plain brown\n\nEach of these is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Now, considering the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratios would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to dihybrid crosses, but adjusted for the fact that each trait is expressed based on dominant alleles.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9 (C_B_B_b), 3 (C_bb_B_B), 3 (C_B_bb), and 1 (cc_bb). Translating this into phenotypes, each corresponds to one of the four possible combinations above.\n\nHowever, according to the problem, the dominant allele for pigment (C) is present for red, and the dominant allele for body color (B) is present for brown. Therefore, the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait being expressed. Thus, the four phenotypes are possible, each occurring with the following probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (C and B present)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (C present, B absent)\n- Plain red: 3/16 (C absent, B present)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 (C absent, B absent)\n\nWait, but in reality, the probabilities are calculated as follows: each gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (for pigment) and a 3/4 chance of being present for body color. But when considering both genes together, the 9:3:3:1 ratio applies. However, in terms of phenotypes, since each trait is determined by the presence of a dominant allele, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16\nCheckered brown: 3/16\nPlain red: 3/16\nPlain brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none of them match this exact ratio. Instead, the options suggest that only checkered red is expressed in certain cases, which conflicts with our analysis. Therefore, perhaps the problem intends that only one trait is expressed, depending on the presence of dominant alleles for that trait. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it expresses red regardless of the body color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color, it expresses brown regardless of pigment.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (since any pigment dominant leads to red)\n- Plain red: 7/16 (only c present for pigment, b present for body)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (C present, b present)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 (both c and b present)\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the initial thought. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the respective phenotype. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both traits present: Checkered red (9/16)\n- Only pigment red: Checkered brown (3/16)\n- Only body brown: Plain red (3/16)\n- Neither trait present: Plain brown (1/16)\n\nAgain, none of the answer options match this scenario. Given the confusion, perhaps the problem assumes that only the pigment color affects the phenotype, ignoring the body color. Or vice versa. If only pigment color is considered, then:\n\n- Pigment red: 9/16\n- Plain red: 7/16\n\nBut that would ignore the body color, leading to a 3:1 ratio for pigments. However, the problem mentions both colors, so that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that each bird can only express one trait based on the presence of dominant alleles for that trait alone. For example, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, regardless of body color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color, it will express brown, regardless of pigment. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red: 9/16 (any pigment dominant)\n- Body brown: 3/16 (any body dominant)\n- Both: 9/16 (pigment dominant) + 3/16 (body dominant) = 12/16, but overlapping occurs if both traits are present. This complicates things, but under simple logic, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Plain red: 7/16 (no pigment dominant)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWhich doesn't align with the options provided. Given this, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of dominant alleles for each trait leads to that phenotype, resulting in the 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. However, since none of the options match this, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the assumption that only one trait is expressed, disregarding the other. \n\nGiven that, if only pigment color is considered, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Plain red: 7/16\n\nBut again, this doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let me try calculating the possible F2 phenotypes directly.\n\nParental cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, producing F1 as CcBb. F1 selfing produces F2. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (50%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (0%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb x CB: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, each parent contributes a gamete:\n\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% cB\n- 25% cb\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (50%)\n3. CB + cB \u2192 Cc BB (25%)\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Red (C present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Red (C present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain red\n3. Plain (c present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Plain (c present) and Checkered (b present) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, to determine how often each phenotype appears in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 100%\n- Absence (c): 50%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 100%\n- Absence (b): 50%\n\nSince both genes are present, the overall probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: 1 * 1 = 100% \u2192 checkered red\n- C present, B absent: 1 * 0 = 0% \u2192 checkered brown\n- C absent, B present: 0 * 1 = 0% \u2192 plain brown\n- C absent, B absent: 0 * 0 = 0% \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are required for each phenotype, then:\n\n- To be checkered red: must have C present and B present. Probability is 1 * 1 = 1 (or 100%).\n- To be checkered brown: must have C present but B absent. Probability is 1 * 0 = 0.\n- To be plain brown: must have C absent but B present. Probability is 0 * 1 = 0.\n- To be plain red: must have C absent and B absent. Probability is 0 * 0 = 0.\n\nBut this seems off because it suggests that only checkered red is ever expressed, which contradicts typical dihybrid crosses where all four phenotypes can exist. Maybe I made a mistake in considering dominance. Wait, in reality, both genes are acting, so the presence of either dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. But in this case, the dominant allele for pigment is C, and for body is B. So the presence of any dominant allele results in that trait being expressed.\n\nSo the actual phenotypes should be determined by whether each allele is dominant or recessive. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: C present and B present \u2192 100%\n2. Plain red: C present and B absent \u2192 0%\n3. Checkered brown: C absent and B present \u2192 0%\n4. Plain brown: C absent and B absent \u2192 0%\n\nBut that implies that only checkered red is ever observed, which doesn't align with standard dihybrid crosses where all four phenotypes are possible. Perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the presence of dominant alleles leads to those traits, but if both are present, it's one phenotype, and if either is missing, another. But according to the given problem statement, both genes are acting, so each bird must express both traits unless one is recessive.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured such that each gene contributes to the phenotype in a way that requires both dominant alleles to display both traits. So, for example, to exhibit both traits, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: C present and B present \u2192 100%\n- Checkered brown: C present and b present \u2192 0%\n- Plain red: c present and B present \u2192 0%\n- Plain brown: c present and b present \u2192 0%\n\nThis still doesn't explain why some phenotypes wouldn't occur. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied dominance. If C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, then the presence of C or B leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. However, if both are present, it might be a different phenotype. But according to the problem statement, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red (100%)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown (0%)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown (0%)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red (0%)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because standard dihybrid crosses usually result in four phenotypes. Maybe the problem is structured differently. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles leads to a specific phenotype regardless of the other gene. So, for example, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it displays both. Otherwise, it displays the other trait. That could lead to all four phenotypes being possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each trait is determined separately, so the presence of dominant alleles for pigment color leads to red, and for body color leads to brown. So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment is red, and a bird with at least one dominant allele for body is brown. Thus, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both traits present \u2192 Checkered red (100%)\n2. Pigment present, body absent \u2192 Checkered brown (0%)\n3. Pigment absent, body present \u2192 Plain brown (0%)\n4. Pigment absent, body absent \u2192 Plain red (0%)\n\nThat makes sense. So the phenotypic ratios would be 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red. But none of the answer options seem to match that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nThe options given are A through H, each providing a different phenotypic ratio. The user asked to select the correct option, and the assistant was supposed to provide the reasoning and then choose the letter. So, after analyzing, I realize that according to the problem description, only checkered red is ever observed because the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match my conclusion that only checkered red is expressed. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that red color is determined by the dominant gene C, and brown by B. So, the presence of any dominant allele for each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C present, B present) \u2192 100%\n2. Checkered brown (C present, b present) \u2192 0%\n3. Plain red (c present, B present) \u2192 0%\n4. Plain brown (c present, b present) \u2192 0%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red. None of the options reflect this exactly, but looking closer, perhaps the user intended that only the presence of dominant alleles for either trait leads to that phenotype, without requiring both. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that each bird can express only one trait based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, under standard Mendelian inheritance, this isn't the case because the expression depends on the presence of dominant alleles across multiple loci.\n\nGiven that, the most accurate phenotypic ratio is 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain brown, and 0% plain red. Looking at the options provided, this doesn't match any, suggesting a misunderstanding or error in the problem setup. However, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me reread it.\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown by B. Checkered is controlled by recessive alleles.\" Wait, hold on! The problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C,\" implying that C is responsible for red, while B is responsible for brown. Also, \"checkered is controlled by recessive alleles.\" So, the recessive allele for pigment color (c) and the recessive allele for body color (b) combine to make the bird checkered.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both pigment and body are red (C and B present): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present), body brown (B absent): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c present), body red (B absent): Plain red\n4. Pigment plain (c present), body brown (b present): Plain brown\n\nEach of these is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Now, considering the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratios would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to dihybrid crosses, but adjusted for the fact that each trait is expressed based on dominant alleles.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9 (C_B_B_b), 3 (C_bb_B_B), 3 (C_B_bb), and 1 (cc_bb). Translating this into phenotypes, each corresponds to one of the four possible combinations above.\n\nHowever, according to the problem, the dominant allele for pigment (C) is present for red, and the dominant allele for body color (B) is present for brown. Therefore, the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait being expressed. Thus, the four phenotypes are possible, each occurring with the following probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (C and B present)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (C present, B absent)\n- Plain red: 3/16 (C absent, B present)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 (C absent, B absent)\n\nWait, but in reality, the probabilities are calculated as follows: each gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (for pigment) and a 3/4 chance of being present for body color. But when considering both genes together, the 9:3:3:1 ratio applies. However, in terms of phenotypes, since each trait is determined by the presence of a dominant allele, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16\nCheckered brown: 3/16\nPlain red: 3/16\nPlain brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none of them match this exact ratio. Instead, the options suggest that only checkered red is expressed in certain cases, which conflicts with our analysis. Therefore, perhaps the problem intends that only one trait is expressed, depending on the presence of dominant alleles for that trait. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it expresses red regardless of the body color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color, it expresses brown regardless of pigment.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (since any pigment dominant leads to red)\n- Plain red: 7/16 (only c present for pigment, b present for body)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (C present, b present)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 (both c and b present)\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the initial thought. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the respective phenotype. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both traits present: Checkered red (9/16)\n- Only pigment red: Checkered brown (3/16)\n- Only body brown: Plain red (3/16)\n- Neither trait present: Plain brown (1/16)\n\nAgain, none of the answer options match this scenario. Given the confusion, perhaps the problem assumes that only the pigment color affects the phenotype, ignoring the body color. Or vice versa. If only pigment color is considered, then:\n\n- Pigment red: 9/16\n- Plain red: 7/16\n\nBut that would ignore the body color, leading to a 3:1 ratio for pigments. However, the problem mentions both colors, so that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that each bird can only express one trait based on the presence of dominant alleles for that trait alone. For example, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, regardless of body color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color, it will express brown, regardless of pigment. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red: 9/16 (any pigment dominant)\n- Body brown: 3/16 (any body dominant)\n- Both: 9/16 (pigment dominant) + 3/16 (body dominant) = 12/16, but overlapping occurs if both traits are present. This complicates things, but under simple logic, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Plain red: 7/16 (no pigment dominant)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWhich doesn't align with the options provided. Given this, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of dominant alleles for each trait leads to that phenotype, resulting in the 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. However, since none of the options match this, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the assumption that only one trait is expressed, disregarding the other. \n\nGiven that, if only pigment color is considered, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Plain red: 7/16\n\nBut again, this doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let me try calculating the possible F2 phenotypes directly.\n\nParental cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, producing F1 as CcBb. F1 selfing produces F2. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (50%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (0%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb x CB: Cc Bb (50%)\n- From cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, each parent contributes a gamete:\n\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% cB\n- 25% cb\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (50%)\n3. CB + cB \u2192 Cc BB (25%)\n4. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (another 25%)\n5. cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n7. cB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n8. cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n9. cB + cB \u2192 cc BB (25%)\n10. cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Instead, the general formula for dihybrid cross is that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for two independently assorting genes. Therefore, applying this to the problem, the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the answer options. Looking back at the options, I see that option G is 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown, which sums to 16, matching the 16 total. Option D is 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which also sums to 16. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, summing to 16.\n\nOption J is 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, which sums to 12, not 16.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Pigment Plain (c) & Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo there are four phenotypic classes. Now, the probability of each class depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (C) \u2192 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence of C (c) \u2192 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (B) \u2192 75%\n- Absence of B (b) \u2192 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Let's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (C present, B present):\n   - Probability = 0.75 (C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\n2. Plain red (C absent, B present):\n   - Probability = 0.25 (c) * 0.75 (B) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n3. Checkered brown (C present, B absent):\n   - Probability = 0.75 (C) * 0.25 (b) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n4. Plain brown (C absent, B absent):\n   - Probability = 0.25 (c) * 0.25 (b) = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into ratios:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown =\n56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25%:\n(56.25 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (6.25 / 6.25)\nWhich simplifies to:\n9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, let me double-check that division:\n56.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 9\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n6.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 1\nYes, that's correct.

Let me check the user's options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,8,4\n\nC.9,3,9,3\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,3,1\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK. Hmm, none of these seem to fit my calculation of 9:3:3:1. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me re-examine the calculations. Maybe I misapplied dominance. For the C locus, presence of C leads to red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, for the B locus, presence of B leads to brown body, regardless of C. So the four phenotypes are indeed Checkered red, Plain red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown.\n\nBut according to the probabilities, the Checkered red is the most common, followed by plain red and checkered brown, then plain brown being rare.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0 which doesn't fit. Option C is 9,3,9,3, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which seems inverted. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try calculating the probabilities differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the genes interact in some way, but the question states they act independently. Another approach could be to use a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately. For example, for the C locus, the parents are CC and cc, so F1 has a 50% chance of being C and 50% c. For the B locus, both parents are BB and bb, so F1 has a 50% chance of being B and 50% b. Then, the F2 would have combinations:\n\n- C/B: 25% CC BB (Checkered red)\n\n- C/b: 25% CC bb (Plain red)\n\n- c/B: 25% cc BB (Checkered brown)\n\n- c/b: 25% cc bb (Plain brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is 25% each for the four phenotypes, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this contradicts the previous analysis. Wait, this must mean I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parent 1 is CC BB. That means for the C gene, it's homozygous dominant, so C. For the B gene, it's homozygous dominant, so B. Parent 2 is cc bb: both genes are recessive. So when they self, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for C locus: 25% C, 25% c\n\nFor B locus: 25% B, 25% b\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (Checkered red)\n\n- CC bb: 25% (Plain red)\n\n- cc BB: 25% (Checkered brown)\n\n- cc bb: 25% (Plain brown)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, meaning each phenotype equally likely. But that conflicts with the initial thought of 9:3:3:1. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the parents. The user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous checkered red means both genes are dominant (C and B), while plain brown means both genes are recessive (c and b). Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, as I initially thought. Then, F2 would produce four phenotypes each with 25% frequency, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer options provided, none seem to match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option F, which says all four phenotypes equally represented. But in reality, the F2 would have four phenotypes each at 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include that exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in a larger population, say 100 individuals, resulting in 25 each, so 25/100 for each, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but none of the options match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option F, which is 4,4,4,4, implying equal numbers. But according to my calculation, each phenotype is 25%, so 25/100 each. So perhaps the intended answer was 25% each, but presented as 1:1:1:1. However, the options do not have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing F2 but rather considering the F1 as the starting point. If we're considering F1 (CcBb) selfing, then the F2 would be the same as before, with each phenotype at 25%. Therefore, the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options match that.\n\nWait, let me look back at the user's options:\n\nOptions are labeled from A to J, each providing different ratios. Let me see which one matches my calculation. According to my previous reasoning, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that's not among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the probabilities:\n\n- For C locus: 75% (C) and 25% (c)\n- For B locus: 75% (B) and 25% (b)\nThe four phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%)\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nAdding these percentages: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nExpressed as a ratio: 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nDividing each by 6.25: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThis gives the ratio 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none directly provide this. The closest might be option C: 9,3,9,3, which sums to 24, but that's incorrect because the total should be 16 parts. Alternatively, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that suggests a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the parents. Let me reconsider the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as both genes are independently assorting. Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nEach phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- CC bb: Plain red (C is dominant, but bb makes it plain)\n- cc BB: Checkered brown (b is recessive, so brown)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both recessive for B and b)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, leading to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the user intended a different approach or made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest that fits the 25% each is option F: 4,4,4,4, representing equal numbers across all four phenotypes. However, mathematically, each should be 25% of the total. \n\nBut looking back, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. In the C locus, C is dominant, so any C allele results in red pigment. In the B locus, B is dominant, so any B allele results in brown body. Therefore, the four phenotypes are correctly identified as above.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is option F, despite the mathematical discrepancy, as it's the closest representation. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to F1 instead of F2. If we were to consider F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to option F.\n\nBut the question specifies F2, so I'm inclined to go with the correct 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't an option. Given that, perhaps the best choice is option F, which assumes equal representation across all four phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for F1, but the question clearly states F2. Without further information, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer isn't listed, but based on the options, option F is the closest, though mathematically accurate F2 shouldn't have such a ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial interpretation. Let me verify once more. If both parents are homozygous for both traits (CC BB and cc bb), their F1 would be CcBb. When CcBb selfs, the F2 would have the following:\n\nFor the C locus: 50% C, 50% c\nFor the B locus: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the four genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25% (but what phenotype does this have?)\nWait, no, the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the dominance hierarchy, not the genotype. Each F2 individual would express the phenotype corresponding to their presence of dominant alleles for either or both genes.\n\nWait, this changes things. Because even though the genotype is CC Bb, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for either gene. For example, if an individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes, they might express a certain phenotype. However, the question doesn't specify whether the traits are additive or dominant in a particular way. Assuming that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective phenotype, then the F2 genotypes would determine the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each gene acts independently, so the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or absent (recessive). So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene would lead to the respective phenotype. For instance:\n\n- If an individual has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, they would display both traits (e.g., Checkered red).\n- If they have at least one dominant C but not B, they'd display red pigmented body (Checkered brown).\n- If they have at least one dominant B but not C, they'd display plain red (plain red).\n- If they have neither dominant C nor B, they\u2019d display plain brown.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n4. Neither dominant: Plain brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 genotype probabilities.\n\nIn F2, each gene segregates independently, so for the C locus, each gamete has a 50% chance of being C or c, and similarly for the B locus.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: 25%\n2. CC Bb: 25%\n3. cc BB: 25%\n4. cc Bb: 25%\n\nBut we need to map these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. cc BB: Plain red\n4. cc Bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but how many of these 25% fall into each category? Let's see:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25% (since B is dominant, they will exhibit Checkered brown)\n- cc BB: 25% (Plain red)\n- cc Bb: 25% (Plain brown)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, 25% Plain brown. This gives a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which is equivalent to 4:4:4:4 when expressed as counts for 100 individuals.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F states a phenotypic ratio of 4,4,4,4, which aligns with this calculation. Therefore, despite the initial confusion, option F is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) & Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment Red (C) & Checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment Plain (c) & Brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment Plain (c) & Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo there are four phenotypic classes. Now, the probability of each class depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (C) \u2192 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence of C (c) \u2192 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (B) \u2192 75%\n- Absence of B (b) \u2192 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Let's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (C present, B present):\n   - Probability = 0.75 (C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\n2. Plain red (C absent, B present):\n   - Probability = 0.25 (c) * 0.75 (B) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n3. Checkered brown (C present, B absent):\n   - Probability = 0.75 (C) * 0.25 (b) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n4. Plain brown (C absent, B absent):\n   - Probability = 0.25 (c) * 0.25 (b) = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into ratios:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown =\n56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25%:\n(56.25 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (6.25 / 6.25)\nWhich simplifies to:\n9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, let me double-check that division:\n56.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 9\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n6.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 1\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2013 Not matching.\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2013 No.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2013 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2013 No.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2013 No.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2013 No, because our ratio is 9:3:3:1.\nWait, none of the given options seem to match exactly. Let me check the user's options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,8,4\n\nC.9,3,9,3\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,3,1\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK. Hmm, none of these seem to fit my calculation of 9:3:3:1. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me re-examine the calculations. Maybe I misapplied dominance. For the C locus, presence of C leads to red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, for the B locus, presence of B leads to brown body, regardless of C. So the four phenotypes are indeed Checkered red, Plain red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown.\n\nBut according to the probabilities, the Checkered red is the most common, followed by plain red and checkered brown, then plain brown being rare.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0 which doesn't fit. Option C is 9,3,9,3, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which seems inverted. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try calculating the probabilities differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the genes interact in some way, but the question states they act independently. Another approach could be to use a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately. For example, for the C locus, the parents are CC and cc, so F1 has a 50% chance of being C and 50% c. For the B locus, both parents are BB and bb, so F1 has a 50% chance of being B and 50% b. Then, the F2 would have combinations:\n\n- C/B: 25% CC BB (Checkered red)\n\n- C/b: 25% CC bb (Plain red)\n\n- c/B: 25% cc BB (Checkered brown)\n\n- c/b: 25% cc bb (Plain brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is 25% each for the four phenotypes, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this contradicts the previous analysis. Wait, this must mean I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parent 1 is CC BB. That means for the C gene, it's homozygous dominant, so C. For the B gene, it's homozygous dominant, so B. Parent 2 is cc bb: both genes are recessive. So when they self, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for C locus: 25% C, 25% c\n\nFor B locus: 25% B, 25% b\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (Checkered red)\n\n- CC bb: 25% (Plain red)\n\n- cc BB: 25% (Checkered brown)\n\n- cc bb: 25% (Plain brown)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, meaning each phenotype equally likely. But that conflicts with the initial thought of 9:3:3:1. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the parents. The user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous checkered red means both genes are dominant (C and B), while plain brown means both genes are recessive (c and b). Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, as I initially thought. Then, F2 would produce four phenotypes each with 25% frequency, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer options provided, none seem to match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option F, which says all four phenotypes equally represented. But in reality, the F2 would have four phenotypes each at 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include that exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in a larger population, say 100 individuals, resulting in 25 each, so 25/100 for each, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but none of the options match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option F, which is 4,4,4,4, implying equal numbers. But according to my calculation, each phenotype is 25%, so 25/100 each. So perhaps the intended answer was 25% each, but presented as 1:1:1:1. However, the options do not have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing F2 but rather considering the F1 as the starting point. If we're considering F1 (CcBb) selfing, then the F2 would be the same as before, with each phenotype at 25%. Therefore, the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options match that.\n\nWait, let me look back at the user's options:\n\nOptions are labeled from A to J, each providing different ratios. Let me see which one matches my calculation. According to my previous reasoning, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that's not among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the probabilities:\n\n- For C locus: 75% (C) and 25% (c)\n- For B locus: 75% (B) and 25% (b)\nThe four phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%)\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nAdding these percentages: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nExpressed as a ratio: 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nDividing each by 6.25: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThis gives the ratio 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none directly provide this. The closest might be option C: 9,3,9,3, which sums to 24, but that's incorrect because the total should be 16 parts. Alternatively, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that suggests a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the parents. Let me reconsider the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as both genes are independently assorting. Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nEach phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- CC bb: Plain red (C is dominant, but bb makes it plain)\n- cc BB: Checkered brown (b is recessive, so brown)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both recessive for B and b)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, leading to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the user intended a different approach or made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest that fits the 25% each is option F: 4,4,4,4, representing equal numbers across all four phenotypes. However, mathematically, each should be 25% of the total. \n\nBut looking back, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. In the C locus, C is dominant, so any C allele results in red pigment. In the B locus, B is dominant, so any B allele results in brown body. Therefore, the four phenotypes are correctly identified as above.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is option F, despite the mathematical discrepancy, as it's the closest representation. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to F1 instead of F2. If we were to consider F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to option F.\n\nBut the question specifies F2, so I'm inclined to go with the correct 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't an option. Given that, perhaps the best choice is option F, which assumes equal representation across all four phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for F1, but the question clearly states F2. Without further information, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer isn't listed, but based on the options, option F is the closest, though mathematically accurate F2 shouldn't have such a ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial interpretation. Let me verify once more. If both parents are homozygous for both traits (CC BB and cc bb), their F1 would be CcBb. When CcBb selfs, the F2 would have the following:\n\nFor the C locus: 50% C, 50% c\nFor the B locus: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the four genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25% (but what phenotype does this have?)\nWait, no, the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the dominance hierarchy, not the genotype. Each F2 individual would express the phenotype corresponding to their presence of dominant alleles for either or both genes.\n\nWait, this changes things. Because even though the genotype is CC Bb, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for either gene. For example, if an individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes, they might express a certain phenotype. However, the question doesn't specify whether the traits are additive or dominant in a particular way. Assuming that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective phenotype, then the F2 genotypes would determine the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each gene acts independently, so the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or absent (recessive). So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene would lead to the respective phenotype. For instance:\n\n- If an individual has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, they would display both traits (e.g., Checkered red).\n- If they have at least one dominant C but not B, they'd display red pigmented body (Checkered brown).\n- If they have at least one dominant B but not C, they'd display plain red (plain red).\n- If they have neither dominant C nor B, they\u2019d display plain brown.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red\n4. Neither dominant: Plain brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 genotype probabilities.\n\nIn F2, each gene segregates independently, so for the C locus, each gamete has a 50% chance of being C or c, and similarly for the B locus.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: 25%\n2. CC Bb: 25%\n3. cc BB: 25%\n4. cc Bb: 25%\n\nBut we need to map these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. cc BB: Plain red\n4. cc Bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but how many of these 25% fall into each category? Let's see:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25% (since B is dominant, they will exhibit Checkered brown)\n- cc BB: 25% (Plain red)\n- cc Bb: 25% (Plain brown)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, 25% Plain brown. This gives a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which is equivalent to 4:4:4:4 when expressed as counts for 100 individuals.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F states a phenotypic ratio of 4,4,4,4, which aligns with this calculation. Therefore, despite the initial confusion, option F is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So let's list them:",
    "rollout": " So let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Each gene has a 50% chance of being present in each gamete. So the overall probabilities can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) AND Body brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Pigment red (C) AND Body checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain (c) AND Body brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain (c) AND Body checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the actual probabilities might not be exactly 25% each due to some genetic interactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of phenotypic classes and their counts.\n\nBut another approach is to recognize that for each gene, the presence or absence leads to certain phenotypic expressions. Since the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios will follow a 1:1:1:1 pattern, except when there are epistatic relationships, which aren't mentioned here. Assuming no such relationship, each phenotype will occur equally likely, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options given, none of them seem to match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, implying that the presence of C results in a different phenotype than when c is present, regardless of other factors. Similarly, the plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is governed by B (dominant), and brown by b. So the phenotypes are determined by both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes has a probability of 25%, assuming independence. But looking back at the options provided, none of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options suggest different ratios. Perhaps I'm missing something in the problem description.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not asking for the F2 ratios directly but rather to determine the possible phenotypes and their frequencies after the F2 generation. Looking at option G, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which seems too high unless the calculation includes overlapping. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that some phenotypes cannot coexist or are impossible under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a Punnett square considering the F1 and then determining the F2. But earlier, I thought the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be 25% each of four phenotypes, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't reflect that. Maybe I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If the F2 generation yields a 1:1:1:1 ratio, the options provided don't include that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me try another angle. Suppose the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb (as previously stated). Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. In the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly, for the B locus, BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (since C is present, and B is present)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (same C, different B)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (different B)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (different C)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (different C)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (different C)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red (different C)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (different C)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red (both different)\n\nWait, that's nine possible genotypes. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB and Cc BB \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb and Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb and Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Plain red: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:2:3, which sums to 9. This doesn't match any of the options either. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, which suggests a 5:3:2:6 ratio, which isn't what I calculated.\n\nOption E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16, which also doesn't fit my previous calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me reconsider the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each occurring at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 Checkered (regardless of B)\n- c is recessive \u2192 Plain (regardless of B)\n- B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C (Checkered) or c (Plain) and the presence of B (Brown) or b (Checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C (Checkered) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. C (Checkered) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 2 Checkered brown : 2 Plain red \u2192 1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question mentions a dihybrid cross, which typically involves two genes. But the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), making them testcrossing for each gene separately. Therefore, each gene will segregate into 50% dominant and recessive, leading to a 1:1 ratio for each gene. Combining both genes, the phenotypic ratio could still be 1:1:1:1 if there's no interaction. But looking at the options, none match this.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nWait, but according to my previous analysis, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't reflected in any of the options. This suggests that perhaps the correct answer isn't among the choices, but since the user expects one of them, I must have made a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes. Wait, the problem states \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous implies that both genes are dominant (for checkered) and recessive (for plain) respectively. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be 25% each of the four phenotypes. But the options don't align with that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, i.e., all gametes are the same. But that wouldn't make sense for two linked genes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a different kind of dihybrid cross where the genes are linked and the F2 ratio is affected by recombination. But the problem doesn't mention anything about linkage, so I shouldn't assume that.\n\nGiven that none of the options match a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me revisit the F2 phenotypes:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B present)\n2. Checkered brown (C and B absent)\n3. Plain red (c and B absent)\n4. Plain brown (c and B present)\n\nEach of these can occur depending on the segregation of the two genes. For each gene, there's a 50% chance of dominant or recessive. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is 25%. Hence, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't among the options, I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not asking for the F2 ratio but the F1 ratio, but the options don't reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the number of each phenotype. Let me count how many times each phenotype appears in the F2:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Cases\n--- | ---\nCheckered red (C and B) | 2 (CC BB and Cc BB)\nCheckered brown (C and b) | 2 (CC Bb and Cc Bb)\nPlain red (c and b) | 3 (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\nPlain brown (c and B) | 0 (no cases)\n\nSo the ratio is 2:2:3:0, which simplifies to 2:2:3:0. But this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended to ask about the F1 instead of the F2, but the options correspond to F1 phenotypes. Let me check:\n\nF1 is CcBb. The phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is the same as before. Again, none of the options match this.\n\nGiven that, I suspect there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes, but one is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive for one gene. For example, one parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). This setup would lead to F1 being CcBb, and F2 having the four phenotypes in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, the options don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly framed, and the correct answer isn't listed. However, since the user expects one of the options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct F2 ratio is not among the options and select the closest one, but this isn't ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of each phenotype in F2. Let me recount:\n\nIn F2, there are 9 possible genotypes, each with specific phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1 and 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2 and 5 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 7 and 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Cases 3 and 6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nThis results in a 2:2:2:2 ratio, but the options don't reflect this either.\n\nWait, now I realize that perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where the two genes are linked and the F2 ratio is reduced due to recombination. Without information on linkage, this isn't applicable. Therefore, under normal Mendelian assumptions, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't present in the options. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the choices, but since I have to choose, I'll review the options again. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which totals 16, suggesting a higher prevalence of checkered phenotypes. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is similar but distributed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question regarding the F2 generation. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be 25% each of four phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not available, but since I have to choose, I'll look for the most plausible option based on common errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 is being considered without considering the order of genes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not an option. Given the confusion, I'll conclude that none of the options match the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since the user expects an answer, I'll go with the closest logical conclusion, possibly option E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, but that's for a different type of cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, but I have to pick the best fit. Considering that, I'll select option E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, but I'm not sure why that would apply here.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Each gene has a 50% chance of being present in each gamete. So the overall probabilities can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) AND Body brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Pigment red (C) AND Body checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain (c) AND Body brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain (c) AND Body checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the actual probabilities might not be exactly 25% each due to some genetic interactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of phenotypic classes and their counts.\n\nBut another approach is to recognize that for each gene, the presence or absence leads to certain phenotypic expressions. Since the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios will follow a 1:1:1:1 pattern, except when there are epistatic relationships, which aren't mentioned here. Assuming no such relationship, each phenotype will occur equally likely, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options given, none of them seem to match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, implying that the presence of C results in a different phenotype than when c is present, regardless of other factors. Similarly, the plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is governed by B (dominant), and brown by b. So the phenotypes are determined by both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes has a probability of 25%, assuming independence. But looking back at the options provided, none of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options suggest different ratios. Perhaps I'm missing something in the problem description.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not asking for the F2 ratios directly but rather to determine the possible phenotypes and their frequencies after the F2 generation. Looking at option G, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which seems too high unless the calculation includes overlapping. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that some phenotypes cannot coexist or are impossible under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a Punnett square considering the F1 and then determining the F2. But earlier, I thought the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be 25% each of four phenotypes, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't reflect that. Maybe I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If the F2 generation yields a 1:1:1:1 ratio, the options provided don't include that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me try another angle. Suppose the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb (as previously stated). Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. In the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly, for the B locus, BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (since C is present, and B is present)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (same C, different B)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (different B)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (different C)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (different C)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (different C)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red (different C)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (different C)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red (both different)\n\nWait, that's nine possible genotypes. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB and Cc BB \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb and Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC bb and Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Plain red: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:2:3, which sums to 9. This doesn't match any of the options either. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, which suggests a 5:3:2:6 ratio, which isn't what I calculated.\n\nOption E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16, which also doesn't fit my previous calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me reconsider the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each occurring at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 Checkered (regardless of B)\n- c is recessive \u2192 Plain (regardless of B)\n- B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C (Checkered) or c (Plain) and the presence of B (Brown) or b (Checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C (Checkered) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. C (Checkered) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 2 Checkered brown : 2 Plain red \u2192 1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question mentions a dihybrid cross, which typically involves two genes. But the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), making them testcrossing for each gene separately. Therefore, each gene will segregate into 50% dominant and recessive, leading to a 1:1 ratio for each gene. Combining both genes, the phenotypic ratio could still be 1:1:1:1 if there's no interaction. But looking at the options, none match this.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nWait, but according to my previous analysis, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't reflected in any of the options. This suggests that perhaps the correct answer isn't among the choices, but since the user expects one of them, I must have made a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes. Wait, the problem states \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous implies that both genes are dominant (for checkered) and recessive (for plain) respectively. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be 25% each of the four phenotypes. But the options don't align with that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, i.e., all gametes are the same. But that wouldn't make sense for two linked genes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a different kind of dihybrid cross where the genes are linked and the F2 ratio is affected by recombination. But the problem doesn't mention anything about linkage, so I shouldn't assume that.\n\nGiven that none of the options match a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me revisit the F2 phenotypes:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B present)\n2. Checkered brown (C and B absent)\n3. Plain red (c and B absent)\n4. Plain brown (c and B present)\n\nEach of these can occur depending on the segregation of the two genes. For each gene, there's a 50% chance of dominant or recessive. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is 25%. Hence, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't among the options, I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not asking for the F2 ratio but the F1 ratio, but the options don't reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the number of each phenotype. Let me count how many times each phenotype appears in the F2:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Cases\n--- | ---\nCheckered red (C and B) | 2 (CC BB and Cc BB)\nCheckered brown (C and b) | 2 (CC Bb and Cc Bb)\nPlain red (c and b) | 3 (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\nPlain brown (c and B) | 0 (no cases)\n\nSo the ratio is 2:2:3:0, which simplifies to 2:2:3:0. But this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended to ask about the F1 instead of the F2, but the options correspond to F1 phenotypes. Let me check:\n\nF1 is CcBb. The phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is the same as before. Again, none of the options match this.\n\nGiven that, I suspect there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes, but one is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive for one gene. For example, one parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). This setup would lead to F1 being CcBb, and F2 having the four phenotypes in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, the options don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly framed, and the correct answer isn't listed. However, since the user expects one of the options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct F2 ratio is not among the options and select the closest one, but this isn't ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of each phenotype in F2. Let me recount:\n\nIn F2, there are 9 possible genotypes, each with specific phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1 and 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2 and 5 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 7 and 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Cases 3 and 6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nThis results in a 2:2:2:2 ratio, but the options don't reflect this either.\n\nWait, now I realize that perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where the two genes are linked and the F2 ratio is reduced due to recombination. Without information on linkage, this isn't applicable. Therefore, under normal Mendelian assumptions, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't present in the options. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the choices, but since I have to choose, I'll review the options again. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which totals 16, suggesting a higher prevalence of checkered phenotypes. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is similar but distributed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question regarding the F2 generation. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be 25% each of four phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not available, but since I have to choose, I'll look for the most plausible option based on common errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 is being considered without considering the order of genes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not an option. Given the confusion, I'll conclude that none of the options match the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since the user expects an answer, I'll go with the closest logical conclusion, possibly option E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, but that's for a different type of cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, but I have to pick the best fit. Considering that, I'll select option E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, but I'm not sure why that would apply here.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the proportion of each genotype leading to that phenotype. Let's calculate the probabilities for each genotype first.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb.\n  - CB contributes C and B\n  - cb contributes c and b\n\nSo, for each gene:\n- Probability of having C (dominant) = 50%\n- Probability of having c (recessive) = 50%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 50%\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C present) and Body brown (B present) \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25% chance.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Body checkered \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain and Body brown \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain and Body checkered \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n\nWait, but that sums up to 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOptions A through H are various phenotypic ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. None directly match 1:1:1:1. That suggests that my approach might be missing something. Perhaps the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect. Wait, let me double-check the parents. The first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So when they mate, the F1 should be CcBb, and then F2 would have the four possible genotypes, each at 25% frequency.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them list a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Maybe some phenotypes are not expressed due to incomplete dominance or epistasis, but the question doesn't mention any such complexities. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't producing four phenotypes equally, but rather fewer due to certain genotypes being unexpressed.\n\nWait, another possibility: when both genes are dominant, the phenotype may be different than when one is dominant and the other is recessive. In this case, for example, if a bird has both dominant alleles (CC and BB), it might display a different phenotype than one with, say, CB and Bb. But without specific dominance relationships, it's hard to tell. However, the standard Mendelian ratios usually apply unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio in terms of F2 counts, regardless of the actual number of birds. Let's see what the options suggest.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 summing to 12. Option D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 summing to 16. Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 summing to 16. Option A: 6+2+6+2=16. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Option G:12+2+2+0=16. Option H:5+3+2+6=16. Option I:7+5+1+3=16. Option C:9+3+3+1=16. All options sum to 16, except A which also sums to 16. So all options sum to 16, indicating they are expressing the same total population.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look at how many of each phenotype exist in F2. Let's consider the possible phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both alleles are recessive. From the F2, this would be the genotype cc bb, which is 25% of the population.\n- Plain red: This occurs when the C allele is dominant (C present) but B is recessive (b present). Genotype Cc bb, which is 25%?\nWait, no. Wait, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 red, brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\n5. Cc BB \u2192 red, brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red, brown\n7. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\nWait, no, this approach seems confusing. Let me use Punnett squares properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nEach of these occurs at 25% frequency. Now, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigmented red, brown \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigmented red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc bb: Plain, brown \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc BB: Plain, brown \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, that's still conflicting because CC and cc have different genotypes, but same phenotype. Similarly, Bb and bb have the same phenotype. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red-brown\n2. Plain-brown\n3. Plain-red (wait, that's not right because red is determined by C, not by B)\n\nWait, no, red is always dominant over plain, and brown is always dominant over checkered. So:\n\n- If a bird is CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nAdditionally, there's a class where B is present but C is not. Wait, but in our case, all the F2 birds have either C present or not, and B present or not. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown\n2. Plain-brown\n3. Plain-red (Wait, does that make sense? Because red is dominant over plain, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. So, regardless of B, if C is present, the bird is red. Only if C is absent and B is absent, it's plain. Similarly, brown is dominant over checkered, so any bird with at least one B is brown, only if both are absent is it plain.)\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (if C is present)\n2. Plain-brown (if B is present but C is not)\n3. Plain-red (Wait, but red is dominant over plain, so this shouldn't happen. Maybe I made a mistake here.)\n4. Plain-brown (same as above)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that:\n\n- If C is present (either dominant or recessive), the bird is red.\n- If B is present, the bird is brown.\n- If neither is present, the bird is plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Any bird with at least one C \u2192 red\n2. Any bird with at least one B \u2192 brown\n3. Birds that are neither (both C and B are absent) \u2192 plain\n\nWait, no, because even if B is present, if C is absent, the bird is plain-brown. And if C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown: when C is present\n- Plain-brown: when B is present and C is not\n- Plain-red: this is impossible because red is dominant over plain, so any bird with C is red. So perhaps this category doesn't exist. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is C present but B absent, it's red-brown. If C absent and B present, it's plain-brown. If both are absent, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (C present)\n2. Plain-brown (B present, C absent)\n3. Plain (both C and B absent)\n\nWait, but according to the initial question, the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, so checkered would be cc. But in the problem statement, the colors are determined by B and b (brown and checkered). So perhaps the third phenotype is not applicable, and only red and brown and plain are considered.\n\nWait, the original problem states that checkered is determined by c, but the colors are determined by B and b. So, the three phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown (B present)\n2. Red (C present)\n3. Plain (both C and B absent)\n\nBut the initial problem mentions \"red\" and \"brown\" and \"checkered\", which might imply that checkered is separate. However, in our analysis, checkered is represented by the lack of B (since B is brown). So, the third phenotype is plain, which corresponds to both c and b alleles.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red-brown: 50% (from CC BB, Cc Bb, and cc BB?)\nWait, no. Let's count the percentages:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB (25%) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb (25%) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB (25%) \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb (25%) \u2192 plain\n\nSo, red-brown accounts for 50% (25% + 25%), plain-brown is 25%, and plain is 25%. So the phenotypic ratio is 50:25:25, which simplifies to 2:1:1. But none of the answer options reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the options, all of them represent ratios adding to 16 (e.g., option A: 6+2+6+2=16; option B: 8+4+0+4=16; etc.). So perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation isn't correct. Wait, perhaps I missed a step in the F2 calculation. Let me try another approach. \n\nIn F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are determined by the dominant alleles of each gene. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-brown (but wait, B is brown, so perhaps this is redundant)\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain\n\nWait, but the initial analysis was correct. However, none of the answer options match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat each phenotype separately, counting all birds that exhibit that trait, irrespective of the other genes. Let me try that.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered red: Only when both alleles are recessive \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\n- Plain red: When C is present, B absent \u2192 Cc bb (25%)\n\n- Red brown: When C is present, B present \u2192 CC BB, Cc Bb (50%)\n\n- Checkered brown: When neither C nor B are present \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but that leads to four phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. Again, none of the answer options match this. So perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the presence of the dominant alleles, treating the recessive ones as non-existent, thus reducing the number of phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of the dominant coat color, ignoring the recessive checkered, but that contradicts the problem description.\n\nWait, perhaps I should interpret the problem differently. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering the dominance of the alleles. So, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Let me construct the Punnett square correctly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nF1: CC BB and cc bb can only produce gametes CB and cb, respectively. So the F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nEach of these occurs at 25% frequency. Now, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigmented red, brown (red-brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigmented red, brown (red-brown)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, brown (plain-brown)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown (plain-brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown: 50% (from CC BB and Cc Bb)\n2. Plain-brown: 50% (from cc BB and cc Bb?)\n\nWait, no, because Cc Bb is red-brown, so the breakdown is:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown (25%)\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown (25%)\n\nWait, that can't be right because Cc Bb combines with itself to produce Cc Bb and cb Bb?\n\nWait, no, in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 would have the following:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Actually, in a dihybrid cross, the F2 includes four types:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nBut since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is Cc Bb, and selfing would lead to:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nWait, that's four types, but actually, in a dihybrid cross, the F2 should include all possible combinations, so:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nBut since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the gametes are only CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. Cc Bb\n3. Cc Bb\n4. cc bb\n\nWhich correspond to:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Cc Bb would mean both C and B are present, so it should be red-brown, while cc bb is plain-brown. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 50% red-brown (from CC BB and Cc Bb)\n- 50% plain-brown (from cc BB and cc Bb?)\n\nWait, but cc Bb would translate to what phenotype? Let's clarify:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-brown (because C is present)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown (because C is absent, but B is present)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, but in reality, only CC BB and Cc Bb are red-brown, and the rest are plain-brown. Because Cc Bb is red-brown, whereas cc Bb would be red-brown as well because C is present. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is cc Bb, it would have both recessive alleles for B (so brown?) but dominant for C (so red?), making it red-brown as well. But in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the dominant trait.\n\nWait, but the problem defines checkered as recessive, so only when both alleles are recessive do you get plain. So, in the F2:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, but that's getting too complicated. Let me simplify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-brown (since B is present)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red-brown (since B is present)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 red-brown (since C is present)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nSo, all birds that have at least one dominant allele (C or B) will be red-brown, and those with neither will be plain-brown. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 10:6 (16 total), but wait, no. Let me recount the numbers:\n\n- CC",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the proportion of each genotype leading to that phenotype. Let's calculate the probabilities for each genotype first.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb.\n  - CB contributes C and B\n  - cb contributes c and b\n\nSo, for each gene:\n- Probability of having C (dominant) = 50%\n- Probability of having c (recessive) = 50%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 50%\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C present) and Body brown (B present) \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25% chance.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Body checkered \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain and Body brown \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain and Body checkered \u2192 (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n\nWait, but that sums up to 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOptions A through H are various phenotypic ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. None directly match 1:1:1:1. That suggests that my approach might be missing something. Perhaps the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect. Wait, let me double-check the parents. The first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So when they mate, the F1 should be CcBb, and then F2 would have the four possible genotypes, each at 25% frequency.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them list a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Maybe some phenotypes are not expressed due to incomplete dominance or epistasis, but the question doesn't mention any such complexities. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't producing four phenotypes equally, but rather fewer due to certain genotypes being unexpressed.\n\nWait, another possibility: when both genes are dominant, the phenotype may be different than when one is dominant and the other is recessive. In this case, for example, if a bird has both dominant alleles (CC and BB), it might display a different phenotype than one with, say, CB and Bb. But without specific dominance relationships, it's hard to tell. However, the standard Mendelian ratios usually apply unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio in terms of F2 counts, regardless of the actual number of birds. Let's see what the options suggest.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 summing to 12. Option D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 summing to 16. Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 summing to 16. Option A: 6+2+6+2=16. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Option G:12+2+2+0=16. Option H:5+3+2+6=16. Option I:7+5+1+3=16. Option C:9+3+3+1=16. All options sum to 16, except A which also sums to 16. So all options sum to 16, indicating they are expressing the same total population.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look at how many of each phenotype exist in F2. Let's consider the possible phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both alleles are recessive. From the F2, this would be the genotype cc bb, which is 25% of the population.\n- Plain red: This occurs when the C allele is dominant (C present) but B is recessive (b present). Genotype Cc bb, which is 25%?\nWait, no. Wait, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 red, brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\n5. Cc BB \u2192 red, brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red, brown\n7. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\nWait, no, this approach seems confusing. Let me use Punnett squares properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nEach of these occurs at 25% frequency. Now, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigmented red, brown \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigmented red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc bb: Plain, brown \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc BB: Plain, brown \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, that's still conflicting because CC and cc have different genotypes, but same phenotype. Similarly, Bb and bb have the same phenotype. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red-brown\n2. Plain-brown\n3. Plain-red (wait, that's not right because red is determined by C, not by B)\n\nWait, no, red is always dominant over plain, and brown is always dominant over checkered. So:\n\n- If a bird is CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nAdditionally, there's a class where B is present but C is not. Wait, but in our case, all the F2 birds have either C present or not, and B present or not. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown\n2. Plain-brown\n3. Plain-red (Wait, does that make sense? Because red is dominant over plain, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. So, regardless of B, if C is present, the bird is red. Only if C is absent and B is absent, it's plain. Similarly, brown is dominant over checkered, so any bird with at least one B is brown, only if both are absent is it plain.)\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (if C is present)\n2. Plain-brown (if B is present but C is not)\n3. Plain-red (Wait, but red is dominant over plain, so this shouldn't happen. Maybe I made a mistake here.)\n4. Plain-brown (same as above)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that:\n\n- If C is present (either dominant or recessive), the bird is red.\n- If B is present, the bird is brown.\n- If neither is present, the bird is plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Any bird with at least one C \u2192 red\n2. Any bird with at least one B \u2192 brown\n3. Birds that are neither (both C and B are absent) \u2192 plain\n\nWait, no, because even if B is present, if C is absent, the bird is plain-brown. And if C is present, the bird is red, regardless of B. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown: when C is present\n- Plain-brown: when B is present and C is not\n- Plain-red: this is impossible because red is dominant over plain, so any bird with C is red. So perhaps this category doesn't exist. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is C present but B absent, it's red-brown. If C absent and B present, it's plain-brown. If both are absent, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (C present)\n2. Plain-brown (B present, C absent)\n3. Plain (both C and B absent)\n\nWait, but according to the initial question, the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, so checkered would be cc. But in the problem statement, the colors are determined by B and b (brown and checkered). So perhaps the third phenotype is not applicable, and only red and brown and plain are considered.\n\nWait, the original problem states that checkered is determined by c, but the colors are determined by B and b. So, the three phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown (B present)\n2. Red (C present)\n3. Plain (both C and B absent)\n\nBut the initial problem mentions \"red\" and \"brown\" and \"checkered\", which might imply that checkered is separate. However, in our analysis, checkered is represented by the lack of B (since B is brown). So, the third phenotype is plain, which corresponds to both c and b alleles.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red-brown: 50% (from CC BB, Cc Bb, and cc BB?)\nWait, no. Let's count the percentages:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB (25%) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb (25%) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB (25%) \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb (25%) \u2192 plain\n\nSo, red-brown accounts for 50% (25% + 25%), plain-brown is 25%, and plain is 25%. So the phenotypic ratio is 50:25:25, which simplifies to 2:1:1. But none of the answer options reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the options, all of them represent ratios adding to 16 (e.g., option A: 6+2+6+2=16; option B: 8+4+0+4=16; etc.). So perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation isn't correct. Wait, perhaps I missed a step in the F2 calculation. Let me try another approach. \n\nIn F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are determined by the dominant alleles of each gene. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-brown (but wait, B is brown, so perhaps this is redundant)\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain\n\nWait, but the initial analysis was correct. However, none of the answer options match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat each phenotype separately, counting all birds that exhibit that trait, irrespective of the other genes. Let me try that.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered red: Only when both alleles are recessive \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\n- Plain red: When C is present, B absent \u2192 Cc bb (25%)\n\n- Red brown: When C is present, B present \u2192 CC BB, Cc Bb (50%)\n\n- Checkered brown: When neither C nor B are present \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but that leads to four phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. Again, none of the answer options match this. So perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the presence of the dominant alleles, treating the recessive ones as non-existent, thus reducing the number of phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of the dominant coat color, ignoring the recessive checkered, but that contradicts the problem description.\n\nWait, perhaps I should interpret the problem differently. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering the dominance of the alleles. So, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Let me construct the Punnett square correctly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nF1: CC BB and cc bb can only produce gametes CB and cb, respectively. So the F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nEach of these occurs at 25% frequency. Now, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigmented red, brown (red-brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigmented red, brown (red-brown)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, brown (plain-brown)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown (plain-brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown: 50% (from CC BB and Cc Bb)\n2. Plain-brown: 50% (from cc BB and cc Bb?)\n\nWait, no, because Cc Bb is red-brown, so the breakdown is:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown (25%)\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown (25%)\n\nWait, that can't be right because Cc Bb combines with itself to produce Cc Bb and cb Bb?\n\nWait, no, in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 would have the following:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Actually, in a dihybrid cross, the F2 includes four types:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nBut since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is Cc Bb, and selfing would lead to:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nWait, that's four types, but actually, in a dihybrid cross, the F2 should include all possible combinations, so:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nBut since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the gametes are only CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. Cc Bb\n3. Cc Bb\n4. cc bb\n\nWhich correspond to:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Cc Bb would mean both C and B are present, so it should be red-brown, while cc bb is plain-brown. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 50% red-brown (from CC BB and Cc Bb)\n- 50% plain-brown (from cc BB and cc Bb?)\n\nWait, but cc Bb would translate to what phenotype? Let's clarify:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-brown (because C is present)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown (because C is absent, but B is present)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, but in reality, only CC BB and Cc Bb are red-brown, and the rest are plain-brown. Because Cc Bb is red-brown, whereas cc Bb would be red-brown as well because C is present. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is cc Bb, it would have both recessive alleles for B (so brown?) but dominant for C (so red?), making it red-brown as well. But in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the dominant trait.\n\nWait, but the problem defines checkered as recessive, so only when both alleles are recessive do you get plain. So, in the F2:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, but that's getting too complicated. Let me simplify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-brown (since B is present)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red-brown (since B is present)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 red-brown (since C is present)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nSo, all birds that have at least one dominant allele (C or B) will be red-brown, and those with neither will be plain-brown. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 10:6 (16 total), but wait, no. Let me recount the numbers:\n\n- CC",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene has two alleles, the number of possible phenotypes is 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4.",
    "rollout": " Since each gene has two alleles, the number of possible phenotypes is 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4. But wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, then the phenotype could be either red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, or plain-checkered. Alternatively, some may have dominance issues, but given that both genes are active, the phenotypes would be four possible combinations.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain by c. Pigmentation is controlled by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (c) + Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (cB)\n2. Checkered (c) + Plain (c) \u2192 checkered plain (cc)\n3. Plain (c) + Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown (cB)\n4. Plain (c) + Checkered (c) \u2192 plain checkered (cc)\n\nBut wait, this seems off because the C and B loci are separate. Actually, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown (if C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Red-checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n- Plain-brown (if C is recessive and B is dominant)\n- Plain-checkered (if both C and B are recessive)\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, to determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals exhibit each phenotype. Given that the genes are independently assorting, each F2 bird will have a certain probability of expressing each phenotype. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nEach F2 bird is a result of two independent assortment events from the F1 generation. The F1 from the cross of CC BB and cc bb would produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the possible contributions are:\n\n- For C: 50% C, 50% c\n- For B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each gene, there are four possible combinations:\n\n1. C (50%) and B (50%) \u2192 25%\n2. C (50%) and b (50%) \u2192 25%\n3. c (50%) and B (50%) \u2192 25%\n4. c (50%) and b (50%) \u2192 25%\n\nNow, each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. Let's map them:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered brown (cB)\n2. C and b \u2192 Checkered plain (cc)\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain brown (cB)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain checkered (cc)\n\nTherefore, each of these four combinations has a 25% chance of occurring in the F2 generation. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% checkered brown : 25% checkered plain : 25% plain brown : 25% plain checkered. Simplifying, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me look back at the options.\n\nThe options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems incorrect because none of the phenotypes listed are plain red. In reality, none of the birds in F2 are plain red; only plain checkered (cc) and plain brown (cB). Similarly, all birds in F2 are either checkered brown, checkered plain, plain brown, or plain checkered. So looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2013 This suggests that checkered red is rare, which contradicts our calculation.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2013 Again, checkered red isn't part of the actual phenotypes.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2013 This also implies that none of the birds are plain red or plain brown except the checkered ones.\nWait, but according to my analysis, all F2 birds are either checkered brown, checkered plain, plain brown, or plain checkered. None of these are plain red or brown without the checkered component. So the options might have errors, but among the choices, option G mentions checkered red, which isn't present in reality. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match our expectation. However, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misapplied dominance. If the C gene determines pigment color, and c is plain, then:\n\n- If C is present (anywhere), the bird is red.\n- If c is present, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- B present (anywhere) \u2192 brown\n- b present \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (cB)\n2. Checkered plain (cc)\n3. Plain brown (cB)\n4. Plain checkered (cc)\n\nWait, but the bird can't be both checkered and brown unless it's the case where both c and B alleles are present. Wait no, in terms of presence, regardless of where the alleles come from. So the four phenotypes remain as above.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 25% each of the four phenotypes. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the question intended to ask about a different scenario, such as a dihybrid cross without considering dominance but rather looking at the phenotypes based solely on the presence of the alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the presence of dominant alleles results in a particular phenotype, ignoring dominance. For example, if a bird is either checkered or brown (regardless of the presence of the other gene), it might be classified differently. But the standard interpretation is that dominance affects the phenotype.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is considering that the presence of the dominant allele C makes the bird red, and the presence of the dominant allele B makes the bird brown, irrespective of the other gene. So, even if both c and b are present, the bird could still be brown if B is dominant. But in reality, this wouldn't happen because if both alleles are recessive, the bird cannot express either trait. However, in the context of the question, perhaps the focus is on whether the bird is red or brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on whether the bird is red (has at least one dominant C) or brown (has at least one dominant B). The presence of both recessive alleles (cc) would make it neither red nor brown, but according to the options, none mention this. Wait, but the options include \"plain\" as a phenotype. Hmm.\n\nLet me re-examine the options provided:\n\nLooking at the options, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This doesn't seem right because none of the birds are plain red or plain brown without the checkered component. Perhaps the original question had a typo, and the options were meant to include plain checkered instead of plain red. But under the current setup, none of the options correctly represent the true phenotypic distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to consider that the presence of dominant alleles leads to a particular phenotype, ignoring the recessive ones. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one dominant C, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly for color, if at least one B, it's brown; else, checkered. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red-brown (C present OR B present)\n2. Red-checkered (only C present)\n3. Plain-brown (only B present)\n4. Plain-checkered (neither C nor B present)\n\nBut wait, in reality, if a bird has C and B, it's red-brown. If it has C and b, it's red-checkered. If it has c and B, it's plain-brown. And if it has cc (both c), it's plain-checkered. So the four phenotypes are as before.\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype without considering dominance (i.e., considering only the presence of dominant alleles), then the phenotypes would simplify to:\n\n- Red (at least one C): presence of C OR B\n- Brown (at least one B): presence of B\n- Checkered (neither C nor B): presence of cc\n\nBut this would change the counts. Let's recalculate under this assumption.\n\nFirst, the F2 generation would have 16 possible gamete combinations (since each gene is diploid and selfed), but each with a 25% chance. The phenotypes based on presence of dominant alleles would be:\n\n- Red: at least one C \u2192 all except when both alleles are c (cc)\n- Brown: at least one B \u2192 all except when both alleles are cc (but wait, if B is present, regardless of C)\n- Checkered: neither C nor B \u2192 only when both alleles are c\n\nSo, calculating the counts:\n\nTotal F2: 16\n\nRed: All except cc \u2192 15\nBrown: All except cc \u2192 15 (because if B is present, regardless of C)\nCheckered: Only cc \u2192 1\n\nBut this leads to a significant difference from reality. For instance, the majority would be red and brown, with very few checkered birds. However, none of the options reflect this scenario.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This aligns with the idea that only the checkered birds (with both c alleles) are counted as plain, while others are either red or brown. But in reality, all non-checkered birds are either red or brown. So why does option J have checkered red and brown, whereas the rest have plain?\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from the definition of checkered versus plain. If a bird is plain, it must have both c alleles, i.e., cc. Otherwise, it's either red (has at least one C) or brown (has at least one B). So in reality, all birds are either red, brown, or plain. Plain is only cc. So checking the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This suggests that only the checkered birds are considered plain, which is incorrect. Because checkered is defined as having both c alleles, making it plain, while others are either red or brown.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is considering that the bird is plain if both alleles are c, then all birds are either red, brown, or plain. But the options suggest that plain is separate. \n\nLooking again, perhaps the question assumes that a bird is plain if both alleles are recessive (cc), and otherwise, it's red or brown, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. But in reality, a bird can't be both red and brown at the same time. So perhaps the options have errors, but among the choices, option G seems to mix colors incorrectly.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering that the checkered color is determined by the recessive alleles, and the birds with at least one dominant allele are either red or brown. But in reality, a bird can't be both red and brown simultaneously. So the options likely have errors, but among the given choices, option G has the highest checkered birds (12), followed by checkered brown (2), and plain red and brown being zero. This doesn't make sense because all birds would be either red, brown, or plain, with no zero plain red or brown. Hence, option G seems incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F says: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This suggests that all phenotypes are equally represented, which is unlikely because the presence of dominant alleles would skew the ratios towards red and brown.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This is inconsistent because checkered birds shouldn't be considered plain.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems plausible because it reflects a higher proportion of red and brown birds compared to plain.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Here, only a small number of birds are plain (red and brown), which aligns with the concept that most are red or brown.\n\nBut according to the standard genetic model, all F2 birds would be either red, brown, or plain, with no zero plain. Therefore, options G and J have issues with the plain category. Among the remaining options, option I shows a higher proportion of red birds, which matches expectations since having at least one dominant allele (either C or B) leads to red or brown birds. Option J, however, places a high number of checkered birds as plain, which is incorrect because checkered is when both alleles are recessive.\n\nBetween the options, the most accurate representation of the phenotypic ratios would be option G, but it incorrectly classifies checkered as plain, which is not correct. Alternatively, none of the options fully capture the correct ratios, but among the choices, option G has the highest proportion of checkered birds, which is more than any other phenotype, which might not be ideal. \n\nHowever, considering that the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, and given the options, option G has the highest proportion of checkered birds, suggesting that checkered is treated as a distinct phenotype, which is incorrect. Therefore, none of the options are entirely correct, but perhaps the intended answer was option G, despite the terminology issue.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene has two alleles, the number of possible phenotypes is 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4. But wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, then the phenotype could be either red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, or plain-checkered. Alternatively, some may have dominance issues, but given that both genes are active, the phenotypes would be four possible combinations.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain by c. Pigmentation is controlled by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (c) + Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (cB)\n2. Checkered (c) + Plain (c) \u2192 checkered plain (cc)\n3. Plain (c) + Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown (cB)\n4. Plain (c) + Checkered (c) \u2192 plain checkered (cc)\n\nBut wait, this seems off because the C and B loci are separate. Actually, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown (if C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Red-checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n- Plain-brown (if C is recessive and B is dominant)\n- Plain-checkered (if both C and B are recessive)\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, to determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals exhibit each phenotype. Given that the genes are independently assorting, each F2 bird will have a certain probability of expressing each phenotype. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nEach F2 bird is a result of two independent assortment events from the F1 generation. The F1 from the cross of CC BB and cc bb would produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the possible contributions are:\n\n- For C: 50% C, 50% c\n- For B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each gene, there are four possible combinations:\n\n1. C (50%) and B (50%) \u2192 25%\n2. C (50%) and b (50%) \u2192 25%\n3. c (50%) and B (50%) \u2192 25%\n4. c (50%) and b (50%) \u2192 25%\n\nNow, each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. Let's map them:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered brown (cB)\n2. C and b \u2192 Checkered plain (cc)\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain brown (cB)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain checkered (cc)\n\nTherefore, each of these four combinations has a 25% chance of occurring in the F2 generation. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% checkered brown : 25% checkered plain : 25% plain brown : 25% plain checkered. Simplifying, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me look back at the options.\n\nThe options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems incorrect because none of the phenotypes listed are plain red. In reality, none of the birds in F2 are plain red; only plain checkered (cc) and plain brown (cB). Similarly, all birds in F2 are either checkered brown, checkered plain, plain brown, or plain checkered. So looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2013 This suggests that checkered red is rare, which contradicts our calculation.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2013 Again, checkered red isn't part of the actual phenotypes.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2013 This also implies that none of the birds are plain red or plain brown except the checkered ones.\nWait, but according to my analysis, all F2 birds are either checkered brown, checkered plain, plain brown, or plain checkered. None of these are plain red or brown without the checkered component. So the options might have errors, but among the choices, option G mentions checkered red, which isn't present in reality. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match our expectation. However, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misapplied dominance. If the C gene determines pigment color, and c is plain, then:\n\n- If C is present (anywhere), the bird is red.\n- If c is present, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- B present (anywhere) \u2192 brown\n- b present \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (cB)\n2. Checkered plain (cc)\n3. Plain brown (cB)\n4. Plain checkered (cc)\n\nWait, but the bird can't be both checkered and brown unless it's the case where both c and B alleles are present. Wait no, in terms of presence, regardless of where the alleles come from. So the four phenotypes remain as above.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 25% each of the four phenotypes. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the question intended to ask about a different scenario, such as a dihybrid cross without considering dominance but rather looking at the phenotypes based solely on the presence of the alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the presence of dominant alleles results in a particular phenotype, ignoring dominance. For example, if a bird is either checkered or brown (regardless of the presence of the other gene), it might be classified differently. But the standard interpretation is that dominance affects the phenotype.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is considering that the presence of the dominant allele C makes the bird red, and the presence of the dominant allele B makes the bird brown, irrespective of the other gene. So, even if both c and b are present, the bird could still be brown if B is dominant. But in reality, this wouldn't happen because if both alleles are recessive, the bird cannot express either trait. However, in the context of the question, perhaps the focus is on whether the bird is red or brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on whether the bird is red (has at least one dominant C) or brown (has at least one dominant B). The presence of both recessive alleles (cc) would make it neither red nor brown, but according to the options, none mention this. Wait, but the options include \"plain\" as a phenotype. Hmm.\n\nLet me re-examine the options provided:\n\nLooking at the options, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This doesn't seem right because none of the birds are plain red or plain brown without the checkered component. Perhaps the original question had a typo, and the options were meant to include plain checkered instead of plain red. But under the current setup, none of the options correctly represent the true phenotypic distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to consider that the presence of dominant alleles leads to a particular phenotype, ignoring the recessive ones. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one dominant C, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly for color, if at least one B, it's brown; else, checkered. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red-brown (C present OR B present)\n2. Red-checkered (only C present)\n3. Plain-brown (only B present)\n4. Plain-checkered (neither C nor B present)\n\nBut wait, in reality, if a bird has C and B, it's red-brown. If it has C and b, it's red-checkered. If it has c and B, it's plain-brown. And if it has cc (both c), it's plain-checkered. So the four phenotypes are as before.\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype without considering dominance (i.e., considering only the presence of dominant alleles), then the phenotypes would simplify to:\n\n- Red (at least one C): presence of C OR B\n- Brown (at least one B): presence of B\n- Checkered (neither C nor B): presence of cc\n\nBut this would change the counts. Let's recalculate under this assumption.\n\nFirst, the F2 generation would have 16 possible gamete combinations (since each gene is diploid and selfed), but each with a 25% chance. The phenotypes based on presence of dominant alleles would be:\n\n- Red: at least one C \u2192 all except when both alleles are c (cc)\n- Brown: at least one B \u2192 all except when both alleles are cc (but wait, if B is present, regardless of C)\n- Checkered: neither C nor B \u2192 only when both alleles are c\n\nSo, calculating the counts:\n\nTotal F2: 16\n\nRed: All except cc \u2192 15\nBrown: All except cc \u2192 15 (because if B is present, regardless of C)\nCheckered: Only cc \u2192 1\n\nBut this leads to a significant difference from reality. For instance, the majority would be red and brown, with very few checkered birds. However, none of the options reflect this scenario.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This aligns with the idea that only the checkered birds (with both c alleles) are counted as plain, while others are either red or brown. But in reality, all non-checkered birds are either red or brown. So why does option J have checkered red and brown, whereas the rest have plain?\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from the definition of checkered versus plain. If a bird is plain, it must have both c alleles, i.e., cc. Otherwise, it's either red (has at least one C) or brown (has at least one B). So in reality, all birds are either red, brown, or plain. Plain is only cc. So checking the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This suggests that only the checkered birds are considered plain, which is incorrect. Because checkered is defined as having both c alleles, making it plain, while others are either red or brown.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is considering that the bird is plain if both alleles are c, then all birds are either red, brown, or plain. But the options suggest that plain is separate. \n\nLooking again, perhaps the question assumes that a bird is plain if both alleles are recessive (cc), and otherwise, it's red or brown, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. But in reality, a bird can't be both red and brown at the same time. So perhaps the options have errors, but among the choices, option G seems to mix colors incorrectly.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering that the checkered color is determined by the recessive alleles, and the birds with at least one dominant allele are either red or brown. But in reality, a bird can't be both red and brown simultaneously. So the options likely have errors, but among the given choices, option G has the highest checkered birds (12), followed by checkered brown (2), and plain red and brown being zero. This doesn't make sense because all birds would be either red, brown, or plain, with no zero plain red or brown. Hence, option G seems incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F says: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This suggests that all phenotypes are equally represented, which is unlikely because the presence of dominant alleles would skew the ratios towards red and brown.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This is inconsistent because checkered birds shouldn't be considered plain.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems plausible because it reflects a higher proportion of red and brown birds compared to plain.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Here, only a small number of birds are plain (red and brown), which aligns with the concept that most are red or brown.\n\nBut according to the standard genetic model, all F2 birds would be either red, brown, or plain, with no zero plain. Therefore, options G and J have issues with the plain category. Among the remaining options, option I shows a higher proportion of red birds, which matches expectations since having at least one dominant allele (either C or B) leads to red or brown birds. Option J, however, places a high number of checkered birds as plain, which is incorrect because checkered is when both alleles are recessive.\n\nBetween the options, the most accurate representation of the phenotypic ratios would be option G, but it incorrectly classifies checkered as plain, which is not correct. Alternatively, none of the options fully capture the correct ratios, but among the choices, option G has the highest proportion of checkered birds, which is more than any other phenotype, which might not be ideal. \n\nHowever, considering that the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, and given the options, option G has the highest proportion of checkered birds, suggesting that checkered is treated as a distinct phenotype, which is incorrect. Therefore, none of the options are entirely correct, but perhaps the intended answer was option G, despite the terminology issue.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo four phenotypic categories. Now, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on how often each of these occurs. Since each gene is segregating independently, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nBut wait, the actual calculation requires knowing the genotype ratios for each gene. For each gene, the F2 will have a certain distribution. Let's calculate the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (p = frequency of C):\n- In F2 generation, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). So probabilities:\n    - C: 75%\n    - c: 25%\n\nFor Gene B (q = frequency of B):\n- Similarly, possible genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So probabilities:\n    - B: 75%\n    - b: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the multiplication of these probabilities across both genes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of C and B. Let's map each phenotype to its corresponding combination:\n\n1. Checkered red (C c B B)\n   - Probability: P(C is dominant) * P(B is dominant) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n   \n2. Plain red (C c b b)\n   - P(C is dominant) * P(b is recessive) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n   \n3. Checkered brown (c c B B)\n   - P(c is recessive) * P(B is dominant) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n   \n4. Plain brown (c c b b)\n   - P(c is recessive) * P(b is recessive) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me consider the possible phenotypes again:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant: Checkered red\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive: Plain red\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant: Checkered brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive: Plain brown\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the probabilities are indeed as above. Now, converting these decimals into fractions:\n\n- 56.25% = 9/16\n- 18.75% = 3/16\n- 18.75% = 3/16\n- 6.25% = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but none of the answer choices seem to reflect this directly. Looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't add up because 12+2+2+0=16, which matches the denominator. Option H says \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". Summing to 5+3+2+6=16. Option F is 16:4, which doesn't make sense. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, matching our ratio. But according to my earlier calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options given. Hmm, perhaps I've misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait a minute, let me re-examine the parents. The first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of selfing F1. Let's create the F2 generation properly.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014gametes are formed based on the parent's genotype. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete will have one allele from each gene. So for the C locus: C or c, each at 50% chance. For the B locus: B or b, each at 50% chance. So the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB gametes: Cc (from CB) and Bb (from CB)\n- From Cb gametes: Cc (from Cb) and Bb (from Cb)\n- From cB gametes: cc (from cB) and Bb (from cB)\n- From cb gametes: cc (from cb) and Bb (from cb)\n\nNow, calculating the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: Only from Cc + Cc (from CB gametes)\n  - Probability: (25%) (from CB) * (50%) (from Cc) + same for others? Wait, better to use Punnett squares.\n\nActually, a better approach is to construct the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach F1 can produce four types of gametes with equal probability: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nWhen creating the F2:\n\n- CB + CB: CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CB + Cb: Cc Bb (probability 25%)\n- CB + cB: Cc Bb (same as above)\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb (same)\n- Cb + CB: same as above\n- Cb + Cb: CC bb (prob 25%)\n- Cb + cB: cc Bb (prob 25%)\n- Cb + cb: cc bb (prob 25%)\n- cB + CB: same as above\n- cB + Cb: same as above\n- cB + cb: cc bb (same)\n- cb + CB: same as above\n- cb + Cb: same as above\n- cb + cB: same as above\n- cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate. Let me instead think of all possible combinations:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\n- C: 50% C, 50% c\n- B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we combine these:\n\n1. C dominant (C) and B dominant (B): Checkered red\n2. C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): Plain red\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): Checkered brown\n4. C recessive (c) and B recessive (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene:\n\n1.

C recessive (0.25) * B recessive (0.25) = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To express this as whole numbers, we can multiply each by 16 (since 16\u00d70.5625=9, 16\u00d70.1875=3, etc.) resulting in a ratio of 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- A: 6,2,6,2 (sum 16) \u2013 Not matching.\n- B: 8,4,0,4 (sum 16) \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n- C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes!\n- D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n- G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but the ratios don't align.\n- H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't sum to 16.\n- I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly represents the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo four phenotypic categories. Now, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on how often each of these occurs. Since each gene is segregating independently, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nBut wait, the actual calculation requires knowing the genotype ratios for each gene. For each gene, the F2 will have a certain distribution. Let's calculate the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (p = frequency of C):\n- In F2 generation, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). So probabilities:\n    - C: 75%\n    - c: 25%\n\nFor Gene B (q = frequency of B):\n- Similarly, possible genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So probabilities:\n    - B: 75%\n    - b: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the multiplication of these probabilities across both genes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of C and B. Let's map each phenotype to its corresponding combination:\n\n1. Checkered red (C c B B)\n   - Probability: P(C is dominant) * P(B is dominant) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n   \n2. Plain red (C c b b)\n   - P(C is dominant) * P(b is recessive) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n   \n3. Checkered brown (c c B B)\n   - P(c is recessive) * P(B is dominant) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n   \n4. Plain brown (c c b b)\n   - P(c is recessive) * P(b is recessive) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me consider the possible phenotypes again:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant: Checkered red\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive: Plain red\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant: Checkered brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive: Plain brown\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the probabilities are indeed as above. Now, converting these decimals into fractions:\n\n- 56.25% = 9/16\n- 18.75% = 3/16\n- 18.75% = 3/16\n- 6.25% = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but none of the answer choices seem to reflect this directly. Looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't add up because 12+2+2+0=16, which matches the denominator. Option H says \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". Summing to 5+3+2+6=16. Option F is 16:4, which doesn't make sense. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, matching our ratio. But according to my earlier calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options given. Hmm, perhaps I've misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait a minute, let me re-examine the parents. The first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of selfing F1. Let's create the F2 generation properly.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014gametes are formed based on the parent's genotype. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete will have one allele from each gene. So for the C locus: C or c, each at 50% chance. For the B locus: B or b, each at 50% chance. So the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB gametes: Cc (from CB) and Bb (from CB)\n- From Cb gametes: Cc (from Cb) and Bb (from Cb)\n- From cB gametes: cc (from cB) and Bb (from cB)\n- From cb gametes: cc (from cb) and Bb (from cb)\n\nNow, calculating the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: Only from Cc + Cc (from CB gametes)\n  - Probability: (25%) (from CB) * (50%) (from Cc) + same for others? Wait, better to use Punnett squares.\n\nActually, a better approach is to construct the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach F1 can produce four types of gametes with equal probability: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nWhen creating the F2:\n\n- CB + CB: CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CB + Cb: Cc Bb (probability 25%)\n- CB + cB: Cc Bb (same as above)\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb (same)\n- Cb + CB: same as above\n- Cb + Cb: CC bb (prob 25%)\n- Cb + cB: cc Bb (prob 25%)\n- Cb + cb: cc bb (prob 25%)\n- cB + CB: same as above\n- cB + Cb: same as above\n- cB + cb: cc bb (same)\n- cb + CB: same as above\n- cb + Cb: same as above\n- cb + cB: same as above\n- cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate. Let me instead think of all possible combinations:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\n- C: 50% C, 50% c\n- B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we combine these:\n\n1. C dominant (C) and B dominant (B): Checkered red\n2. C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): Plain red\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): Checkered brown\n4. C recessive (c) and B recessive (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene:\n\n1. C dominant (0.75) * B dominant (0.75) = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. C dominant (0.75) * B recessive (0.25) = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. C recessive (0.25) * B dominant (0.75) = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. C recessive (0.25) * B recessive (0.25) = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To express this as whole numbers, we can multiply each by 16 (since 16\u00d70.5625=9, 16\u00d70.1875=3, etc.) resulting in a ratio of 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- A: 6,2,6,2 (sum 16) \u2013 Not matching.\n- B: 8,4,0,4 (sum 16) \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n- C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes!\n- D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n- G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but the ratios don't align.\n- H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't sum to 16.\n- I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly represents the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1. But wait, looking back, none of the options have 9:3:3:1. Oh! Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the parent combination. Let me reconsider the initial setup.\n\nWait, the user provided a different setup where the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me confirm that.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are linked or separate, but in this case, it's likely independent.",
    "rollout": " Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are linked or separate, but in this case, it's likely independent. So the phenotype for each bird is a combination of its pigment and body color. For example, if the bird is C_B_, it could be red-brown, red-checkered, or plain-brown, depending on the B allele. Similarly, if it's c_cc, then it's plain-brown. If it's c_bb, then plain-checkered. But wait, in reality, the interaction of the two genes might influence the phenotype differently, but the problem states that C and B are independent, so each gene's effect doesn't interact. So each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nBut according to the dominance rules: C is dominant over c, B is dominant over b. So the phenotypes can also be categorized as follows:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: red-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent: red-checkered\n- If C is absent and B is present: plain-brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent: plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since the parents are homozygous for both genes (one homozygous dominant and one homozygous recessive), all offspring will inherit those alleles. Specifically, the F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) will be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Therefore, each gene will segregate into 50% dominant and 50% recessive. Since the genes are independent, the probability of any combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo for the C locus:\n\n- 50% C (dominant, red)\n- 50% c (recessive, plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- 50% B (dominant, brown)\n- 50% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is (probability for C) * (probability for B).\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n2. Pigment red and body checkered: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n3. Pigment plain and body brown: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n\nWait, but this suggests a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not possible because the sum would exceed 100%. Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination where the C and B alleles are present or absent. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, each being 25%.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exact ratio. The options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\nThe problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Wait, but I thought we were calculating for F2. Wait, no\u2014the initial cross was between a homozygous red (CC BB) and a homozygous brown (cc bb), resulting in F1 as CcBb, which is all the same. Then, the F1 (which is all CcBb) would produce gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. Then, when F1 (which is all CcBb) selfs, the F2 would include various combinations of these gametes. But earlier, I considered F2 as the result of F1 selfing, which would give a 25% chance for each possible genotype. However, the question refers to the F2 generation after the initial cross, which may imply that F2 is the result of F1 selfing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that's not what's asked either. Wait, the question says \"the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" Hmm, but in my calculation above, the F2 would be the same as F1, since F1 is all CcBb and selfing would lead to F2 being another generation of CcBb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, F2 would be the next generation. So I think I made a mistake earlier by considering F2 as the F1's offspring, but actually, F2 is the result of F1 selfing. So let me correct that.\n\nF1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but in terms of the actual F2 phenotypes, each genotype leads to a specific phenotype based on the combination of the two genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 red-brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CcBb \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. CcBb \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes has a certain probability based on the segregation of the genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the segregation is independent. For the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 50%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 50%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\n1. Red-brown: (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n2. Red-checkered: (50% C) * (50% b) = 25%\n3. Plain-brown: (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n4. Plain-checkered: (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n\nWait, that still gives us a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the answer choices. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Oh, wait! The problem specifies that C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So in terms of dominance, the phenotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- C_: Pigment red\n- cc: Pigment plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B_: Body brown\n- bb: Body checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these. For instance, a bird with C_ and B_ is red-brown, while C_ and bb is red-checkered, and so on. The probabilities for each combination are as calculated before. \n\nLooking back at the options, option E is a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 for red to plain. That doesn't align with our 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which seems too skewed. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar to a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance, but perhaps that's not applicable here. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, matching our calculation. But option F is labeled as the phenotypic ratio for F2, but the options don't provide such an option. Looking at the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16? Not sure.\nB. 6:2:4:4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Sum 16?\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 This looks like a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, but in reality, it would require the squares of the sums, leading to 1,3,5,5,9,15,25. Wait, no\u2014if each gene is two characters, the dihybrid cross would have 4^2 = 16 phenotypic classes, but with dominance, some combine. So the correct dihybrid cross with dominance would have phenotypic ratios based on the probabilities. Our previous calculation gave 4 phenotypes each with 25%, so 1:1:1:1. But the options provided don't reflect this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: 3:9:3:1 \u2192 This is a typical 1:3:3:1 ratio for a monohybrid cross, scaled up for two genes. Wait, but how does this apply here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount the number of phenotypic classes. For two genes with two alleles each, the maximum number of phenotypes is 4. Each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of the two traits. In this case, each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. Since both traits are controlled by one gene each, and the genes are independent, there are 4 phenotypic categories.\n\nBut in reality, due to dominance, some categories combine. For example, a bird with C_ and B_ will always express the dominant C and B traits, regardless of whether they are B_ or b_. Similarly, a bird with c_ and B_ will express the recessive c and dominant B traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation would be 1:1:1:1, each corresponding to the four combinations of the two dominant alleles. But none of the options directly match this. However, looking closely, option F has a ratio of 4:4:4:4, which implies each phenotype has an equal chance, but that's not accurate under dominance. Instead, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, since this ratio isn't listed, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: it asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. But perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 generation itself? Because F1 is all the same, and F2 would be the same as F1. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the question meant the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial cross is between a homozygous red and a homozygous brown, which results in F1 as CcBb, which when selfed, leads to F2. As calculated earlier, F2 would have 25% each for the four phenotypes, so a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at option F: 4:4:4:4. If this represents the ratio of C_ to c_ across both genes, it's not correct because C_ is red in both cases, and c_ is plain. Similarly, B_ is brown, and b_ is checkered. So the ratio of C_ to c_ would be 2:2, but that's not what the options are showing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation compared to the F1 generation, but that wouldn't make sense because F1 and F2 would have different genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me approach it differently. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, each parent produces four gametes: CB, cb, cb, and cb. So the F2 would have 16 possible combinations of these gametes. The phenotypes depend on the presence or absence of C and B alleles.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 (C and B present) \u2192 1/4 of the time\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 (C present, B absent) \u2192 1/4\n3. ccB_: Plain, brown \u2192 (c present, B present) \u2192 1/4\n4. ccbb: Plain, checkered \u2192 (c present, B absent) \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since none of the options match this, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Let me see:\n\nIf F1 is CcBb, then the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- C_ (pigment red) : c_ (plain) \u2192 3:1 (since 3 out of 4 have C_, 1 has c_)\nSimilarly, B_ (brown) : b_ (checkered) \u2192 3:1\n\nSo the overall phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)(3/4) : ... but since each trait is independent, the combined ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red-brown, plus 3/16 for red-checkered, etc. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The correct way is to consider each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nActually, the phenotypic ratio for F1 would be (3/4):(1/4) for pigment color and (3/4):(1/4) for body color. Since these are independent, the combined ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4)) \u2192 9:3:3:1. Which matches option E.\n\nWait, but the question is about F2, not F1. So perhaps I need to clarify. Let me try once more. The F2 generation is the result of F1 selfing. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 will have the following phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nC_B_ (Red-Brown) | 25%\nC_bb (Red-Checkered) | 25%\nccB_ (Plain-Brown) | 25%\nccbb (Plain-Checkered) | 25%\n\nThis gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't an option. However, looking back at the options, option F has a ratio of 4:4:4:4, which would correspond to the proportion of each trait without considering dominance. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. If that's the case, the F1's phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for pigment color and 3:1 for body color, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option E.\n\nBut the question clearly states F2 generation. Given that, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the F1 as the starting point, and the F2 as the result of F1 selfing. In that case, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the initial cross. Let me reconsider the initial cross: it's a homozygous red (CC BB) bird and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. Their F1 would be CcBb, which is all the same, as previously stated. Then, F1 selfing would yield F2 with 25% each for the four phenotypes, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the question includes both F1 and F2 generations, but I think the focus is on F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the F1 and F2 distinctions and simply determine the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the F1's offspring. But that doesn't make much sense. Another possibility is that the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, producing F1 as CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross, and then F2 would be the result of F1 selfing. But that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Let me recast the problem using the dihybrid cross formula. The F2 generation in a dihybrid cross would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't an option. Looking back at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to a 1:1:1:1 ratio scaled by 4. So perhaps the question expects this scaling factor, even though it's not standard practice. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked something else. Let me read the question again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird, resulting in F1 as CcBb. Then, the F2 generation would be the result of F1 selfing, which as we calculated, would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the question expects us to disregard the F1 and focus solely on the F2 generation. However, the question mentions both F1 and F2 generations, implying that F2 is the focus. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are linked or separate, but in this case, it's likely independent. So the phenotype for each bird is a combination of its pigment and body color. For example, if the bird is C_B_, it could be red-brown, red-checkered, or plain-brown, depending on the B allele. Similarly, if it's c_cc, then it's plain-brown. If it's c_bb, then plain-checkered. But wait, in reality, the interaction of the two genes might influence the phenotype differently, but the problem states that C and B are independent, so each gene's effect doesn't interact. So each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nBut according to the dominance rules: C is dominant over c, B is dominant over b. So the phenotypes can also be categorized as follows:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: red-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent: red-checkered\n- If C is absent and B is present: plain-brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent: plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since the parents are homozygous for both genes (one homozygous dominant and one homozygous recessive), all offspring will inherit those alleles. Specifically, the F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) will be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Therefore, each gene will segregate into 50% dominant and 50% recessive. Since the genes are independent, the probability of any combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo for the C locus:\n\n- 50% C (dominant, red)\n- 50% c (recessive, plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- 50% B (dominant, brown)\n- 50% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is (probability for C) * (probability for B).\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n2. Pigment red and body checkered: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n3. Pigment plain and body brown: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n\nWait, but this suggests a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not possible because the sum would exceed 100%. Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination where the C and B alleles are present or absent. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, each being 25%.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exact ratio. The options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\nThe problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Wait, but I thought we were calculating for F2. Wait, no\u2014the initial cross was between a homozygous red (CC BB) and a homozygous brown (cc bb), resulting in F1 as CcBb, which is all the same. Then, the F1 (which is all CcBb) would produce gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. Then, when F1 (which is all CcBb) selfs, the F2 would include various combinations of these gametes. But earlier, I considered F2 as the result of F1 selfing, which would give a 25% chance for each possible genotype. However, the question refers to the F2 generation after the initial cross, which may imply that F2 is the result of F1 selfing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that's not what's asked either. Wait, the question says \"the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" Hmm, but in my calculation above, the F2 would be the same as F1, since F1 is all CcBb and selfing would lead to F2 being another generation of CcBb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, F2 would be the next generation. So I think I made a mistake earlier by considering F2 as the F1's offspring, but actually, F2 is the result of F1 selfing. So let me correct that.\n\nF1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but in terms of the actual F2 phenotypes, each genotype leads to a specific phenotype based on the combination of the two genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 red-brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CcBb \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. CcBb \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes has a certain probability based on the segregation of the genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the segregation is independent. For the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 50%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 50%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\n1. Red-brown: (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n2. Red-checkered: (50% C) * (50% b) = 25%\n3. Plain-brown: (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n4. Plain-checkered: (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n\nWait, that still gives us a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the answer choices. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Oh, wait! The problem specifies that C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So in terms of dominance, the phenotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- C_: Pigment red\n- cc: Pigment plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B_: Body brown\n- bb: Body checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these. For instance, a bird with C_ and B_ is red-brown, while C_ and bb is red-checkered, and so on. The probabilities for each combination are as calculated before. \n\nLooking back at the options, option E is a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 for red to plain. That doesn't align with our 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which seems too skewed. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar to a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance, but perhaps that's not applicable here. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, matching our calculation. But option F is labeled as the phenotypic ratio for F2, but the options don't provide such an option. Looking at the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16? Not sure.\nB. 6:2:4:4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Sum 16?\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 This looks like a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, but in reality, it would require the squares of the sums, leading to 1,3,5,5,9,15,25. Wait, no\u2014if each gene is two characters, the dihybrid cross would have 4^2 = 16 phenotypic classes, but with dominance, some combine. So the correct dihybrid cross with dominance would have phenotypic ratios based on the probabilities. Our previous calculation gave 4 phenotypes each with 25%, so 1:1:1:1. But the options provided don't reflect this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: 3:9:3:1 \u2192 This is a typical 1:3:3:1 ratio for a monohybrid cross, scaled up for two genes. Wait, but how does this apply here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount the number of phenotypic classes. For two genes with two alleles each, the maximum number of phenotypes is 4. Each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of the two traits. In this case, each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. Since both traits are controlled by one gene each, and the genes are independent, there are 4 phenotypic categories.\n\nBut in reality, due to dominance, some categories combine. For example, a bird with C_ and B_ will always express the dominant C and B traits, regardless of whether they are B_ or b_. Similarly, a bird with c_ and B_ will express the recessive c and dominant B traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation would be 1:1:1:1, each corresponding to the four combinations of the two dominant alleles. But none of the options directly match this. However, looking closely, option F has a ratio of 4:4:4:4, which implies each phenotype has an equal chance, but that's not accurate under dominance. Instead, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, since this ratio isn't listed, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: it asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. But perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 generation itself? Because F1 is all the same, and F2 would be the same as F1. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the question meant the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial cross is between a homozygous red and a homozygous brown, which results in F1 as CcBb, which when selfed, leads to F2. As calculated earlier, F2 would have 25% each for the four phenotypes, so a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at option F: 4:4:4:4. If this represents the ratio of C_ to c_ across both genes, it's not correct because C_ is red in both cases, and c_ is plain. Similarly, B_ is brown, and b_ is checkered. So the ratio of C_ to c_ would be 2:2, but that's not what the options are showing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation compared to the F1 generation, but that wouldn't make sense because F1 and F2 would have different genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me approach it differently. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, each parent produces four gametes: CB, cb, cb, and cb. So the F2 would have 16 possible combinations of these gametes. The phenotypes depend on the presence or absence of C and B alleles.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 (C and B present) \u2192 1/4 of the time\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 (C present, B absent) \u2192 1/4\n3. ccB_: Plain, brown \u2192 (c present, B present) \u2192 1/4\n4. ccbb: Plain, checkered \u2192 (c present, B absent) \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since none of the options match this, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Let me see:\n\nIf F1 is CcBb, then the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- C_ (pigment red) : c_ (plain) \u2192 3:1 (since 3 out of 4 have C_, 1 has c_)\nSimilarly, B_ (brown) : b_ (checkered) \u2192 3:1\n\nSo the overall phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)(3/4) : ... but since each trait is independent, the combined ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red-brown, plus 3/16 for red-checkered, etc. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The correct way is to consider each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nActually, the phenotypic ratio for F1 would be (3/4):(1/4) for pigment color and (3/4):(1/4) for body color. Since these are independent, the combined ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4)) \u2192 9:3:3:1. Which matches option E.\n\nWait, but the question is about F2, not F1. So perhaps I need to clarify. Let me try once more. The F2 generation is the result of F1 selfing. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 will have the following phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nC_B_ (Red-Brown) | 25%\nC_bb (Red-Checkered) | 25%\nccB_ (Plain-Brown) | 25%\nccbb (Plain-Checkered) | 25%\n\nThis gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't an option. However, looking back at the options, option F has a ratio of 4:4:4:4, which would correspond to the proportion of each trait without considering dominance. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. If that's the case, the F1's phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for pigment color and 3:1 for body color, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option E.\n\nBut the question clearly states F2 generation. Given that, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the F1 as the starting point, and the F2 as the result of F1 selfing. In that case, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the initial cross. Let me reconsider the initial cross: it's a homozygous red (CC BB) bird and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. Their F1 would be CcBb, which is all the same, as previously stated. Then, F1 selfing would yield F2 with 25% each for the four phenotypes, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the question includes both F1 and F2 generations, but I think the focus is on F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the F1 and F2 distinctions and simply determine the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the F1's offspring. But that doesn't make much sense. Another possibility is that the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, producing F1 as CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross, and then F2 would be the result of F1 selfing. But that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Let me recast the problem using the dihybrid cross formula. The F2 generation in a dihybrid cross would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't an option. Looking back at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to a 1:1:1:1 ratio scaled by 4. So perhaps the question expects this scaling factor, even though it's not standard practice. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked something else. Let me read the question again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird, resulting in F1 as CcBb. Then, the F2 generation would be the result of F1 selfing, which as we calculated, would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the question expects us to disregard the F1 and focus solely on the F2 generation. However, the question mentions both F1 and F2 generations, implying that F2 is the focus. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes gametes that carry either C/C, C/c, c/c for pigment and B/B, B/b, b/b for color. Wait, no\u2014the F2 will have the following possible gametes for each gene: \n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- From F1 (CcBb): The parents produce gametes with C or c.\nSince F1 is CcBb, the probability of passing on C is 50%, c is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for color (B/b):\n- F1 (CcBb) produces gametes with B or b.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have the following combinations for each gene:\n\n- For pigment (C/c):\n  - 50% C, 50% c\n- For color (B/b):\n  - 50% B, 50% b\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): red-brown\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and color recessive (b): red-checkered\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and color dominant (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and color recessive (b): plain-checkered\n\nEach of these combinations has a probability of (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4, except when considering the actual phenotypes. Wait, no, each gene's contribution is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to model the Punnett square for F2. Let's construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F2 will consist of the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nBut looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red-brown\n- CC Bb: red-brown\n- CC bb: plain-brown\n- Cc BB: red-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-checkered\n- Cc bb: red-checkered\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n- cc bb: plain-checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\n- Plain-brown: 2 (from CC bb, c c bb)\n- Red-checkered: 2 (from Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain-checkered: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Let me recount properly. The F2 should have four phenotypic categories, each with specific counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each gene is independently segregating, so the F2 will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. But since we're interested in phenotypes, let's map each genotype to a phenotype.\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nRed-brown | CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB\nPlain-brown | CC bb, c c bb\nRed-checkered | Cc Bb, Cc bb\nPlain-checkered | cc BB, cc Bb\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: How many? Looking at the F2, the genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 x F1:\n\nThe possible gametes for each gene are C (50%) and c (50%) for pigment; B (50%), b (50%) for color.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will have:\n\n- For pigment (C/c):\n\n  - 25% CC (both C)\n  - 50% Cc (one C and one c)\n  - 25% cc (both c)\n  \n- For color (B/b):\n\n  - 25% BB\n  - 50% Bb\n  - 25% bb\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- CC Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- CC bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Cc BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Cc Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- Cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- cc BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- cc Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown (C_B_): CC BB (1/16), CC Bb (1/8), Cc BB (1/16) \u2192 Total: 1+2+1=4 parts\n- Plain-brown (cc B_): CC bb (1/16), cc bb (1/16) \u2192 Total: 2 parts\n- Red-checkered (Cc bb): Cc Bb (1/8), Cc bb (1/16) \u2192 Total: 2 + 1 = 3 parts\n- Plain-checkered (cc B_): cc BB (1/16), cc Bb (1/8) \u2192 Total: 2 parts\n\nWait, but adding the numbers: 4 (red-brown) + 2 (plain-brown) + 3 (red-checkered) + 2 (plain-checkered) = 11, but that's over 16. Hmm, perhaps my approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to count how many of each genotype leads to each phenotype.\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\nEach F2 bird has a genotype for pigment and color. The phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: All genotypes where at least one C and one B. That includes:\n\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n\nTotal: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb and Cc BB) + 2 (CC Bb and Cc Bb?) Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nActually, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown: All cases where pigment is present (at least C) and color is brown (at least B). So any bird where at least one C and at least one B. So the genotypes for this are:\n\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n\nThat's four genotypes.\n\n- Plain-brown: Only when pigment is absent (cc) and color is brown (B). So:\n\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n\nThat's two genotypes.\n\n- Red-checkered: Pigment is present (at least C) and color is recessive (b). So:\n\n  - Cc Bb\n  - Cc bb\n\nTwo genotypes.\n\n- Plain-checkered: Pigment is absent (cc) and color is recessive (b). So:\n\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's overlapping. Let me clarify:\n\nRed-checkered: Cc (p) and bb (b) \u2192 genotype Cc bb.\n\nPlain-checkered: cc (p) and bb (b) \u2192 genotype cc bb.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown: C_B_\n- Plain-brown: cc B_\n- Red-checkered: Cc bb\n- Plain-checkered: cc bb\n\nNow, how many of each?\n\nUsing the Punnett square method, the F2 will have:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB \u2192 Red-brown\n- 2/16 CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown\n- 1/16 Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown\n- 2/16 Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n- 1/16 CC bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n- 2/16 Cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n- 1/16 cc BB \u2192 Plain-checkered\n- 2/16 cc Bb \u2192 Plain-checkered\n- 1/16 cc bb \u2192 Plain-checkered\n\nAdding up the phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 parts\n- Plain-brown: 1 + 2 = 3 parts\n- Red-checkered: 2 + 1 = 3 parts\n- Plain-checkered: 2 + 1 = 3 parts\n\nWait, that adds up to 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13, which is less than 16. Clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nAh, I see\u2014the error is that I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me do it correctly by listing all 16 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1, 2, 4 \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain-brown: Cases 3, 7 \u2192 2 instances\n- Red-checkered: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain-checkered: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that adds up to 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9, but that's still under 16. I must be missing some cases.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 should have 16 possible genotypic combinations. Let me list all 16:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n10. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered (wait, this is same as case 6)\n11. Cc bb \u2192 Red-checkered (same as case 5)\n12. cc BB \u2192 Plain-brown (same as case 3)\n13. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-brown (same as case 7)\n14. cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown (same as case 9)\n15. Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown (same as case 4)\n16. CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown (same as case 2)\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to use the phenotypic ratio instead. Since each gene has two possibilities, and they're independent, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by multiplying the probabilities.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Pigment (C): 50% C, 50% c\n- Color (B): 50% B, 50% b\n\nCombined, each phenotype has a certain probability:\n\n- Red-brown (C_B_): 25% (since both dominant)\n- Plain-brown (cc B_): 25%\n- Red-checkered (Cc bb): 25%\n- Plain-checkered (cc bb): 25%\n\nWait, that makes sense because each gene has a 50% chance of being present or absent, and the presence of each allele is independent.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. With 16 possible genotypic combinations, each phenotype would occur 4 times (since 16 / 4 = 4).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, meaning each phenotype has an equal occurrence.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says:\n\nPhenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014if each phenotype has 25% probability, then in 16 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4.\n\nBut none of the options seem to reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, option F says 4:4:4:4, which matches what I derived. So the correct answer should be F. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nBut wait, checking the options again, the user listed options A-F, with F being 4:4:4:4. So the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes gametes that carry either C/C, C/c, c/c for pigment and B/B, B/b, b/b for color. Wait, no\u2014the F2 will have the following possible gametes for each gene: \n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- From F1 (CcBb): The parents produce gametes with C or c.\nSince F1 is CcBb, the probability of passing on C is 50%, c is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for color (B/b):\n- F1 (CcBb) produces gametes with B or b.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have the following combinations for each gene:\n\n- For pigment (C/c):\n  - 50% C, 50% c\n- For color (B/b):\n  - 50% B, 50% b\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): red-brown\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and color recessive (b): red-checkered\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and color dominant (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and color recessive (b): plain-checkered\n\nEach of these combinations has a probability of (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4, except when considering the actual phenotypes. Wait, no, each gene's contribution is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to model the Punnett square for F2. Let's construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F2 will consist of the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nBut looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red-brown\n- CC Bb: red-brown\n- CC bb: plain-brown\n- Cc BB: red-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-checkered\n- Cc bb: red-checkered\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n- cc bb: plain-checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\n- Plain-brown: 2 (from CC bb, c c bb)\n- Red-checkered: 2 (from Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain-checkered: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Let me recount properly. The F2 should have four phenotypic categories, each with specific counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each gene is independently segregating, so the F2 will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. But since we're interested in phenotypes, let's map each genotype to a phenotype.\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nRed-brown | CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB\nPlain-brown | CC bb, c c bb\nRed-checkered | Cc Bb, Cc bb\nPlain-checkered | cc BB, cc Bb\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: How many? Looking at the F2, the genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 x F1:\n\nThe possible gametes for each gene are C (50%) and c (50%) for pigment; B (50%), b (50%) for color.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will have:\n\n- For pigment (C/c):\n\n  - 25% CC (both C)\n  - 50% Cc (one C and one c)\n  - 25% cc (both c)\n  \n- For color (B/b):\n\n  - 25% BB\n  - 50% Bb\n  - 25% bb\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- CC Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- CC bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Cc BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Cc Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- Cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- cc BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- cc Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown (C_B_): CC BB (1/16), CC Bb (1/8), Cc BB (1/16) \u2192 Total: 1+2+1=4 parts\n- Plain-brown (cc B_): CC bb (1/16), cc bb (1/16) \u2192 Total: 2 parts\n- Red-checkered (Cc bb): Cc Bb (1/8), Cc bb (1/16) \u2192 Total: 2 + 1 = 3 parts\n- Plain-checkered (cc B_): cc BB (1/16), cc Bb (1/8) \u2192 Total: 2 parts\n\nWait, but adding the numbers: 4 (red-brown) + 2 (plain-brown) + 3 (red-checkered) + 2 (plain-checkered) = 11, but that's over 16. Hmm, perhaps my approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to count how many of each genotype leads to each phenotype.\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\nEach F2 bird has a genotype for pigment and color. The phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: All genotypes where at least one C and one B. That includes:\n\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n\nTotal: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb and Cc BB) + 2 (CC Bb and Cc Bb?) Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nActually, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown: All cases where pigment is present (at least C) and color is brown (at least B). So any bird where at least one C and at least one B. So the genotypes for this are:\n\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n\nThat's four genotypes.\n\n- Plain-brown: Only when pigment is absent (cc) and color is brown (B). So:\n\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n\nThat's two genotypes.\n\n- Red-checkered: Pigment is present (at least C) and color is recessive (b). So:\n\n  - Cc Bb\n  - Cc bb\n\nTwo genotypes.\n\n- Plain-checkered: Pigment is absent (cc) and color is recessive (b). So:\n\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's overlapping. Let me clarify:\n\nRed-checkered: Cc (p) and bb (b) \u2192 genotype Cc bb.\n\nPlain-checkered: cc (p) and bb (b) \u2192 genotype cc bb.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown: C_B_\n- Plain-brown: cc B_\n- Red-checkered: Cc bb\n- Plain-checkered: cc bb\n\nNow, how many of each?\n\nUsing the Punnett square method, the F2 will have:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB \u2192 Red-brown\n- 2/16 CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown\n- 1/16 Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown\n- 2/16 Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n- 1/16 CC bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n- 2/16 Cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n- 1/16 cc BB \u2192 Plain-checkered\n- 2/16 cc Bb \u2192 Plain-checkered\n- 1/16 cc bb \u2192 Plain-checkered\n\nAdding up the phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 parts\n- Plain-brown: 1 + 2 = 3 parts\n- Red-checkered: 2 + 1 = 3 parts\n- Plain-checkered: 2 + 1 = 3 parts\n\nWait, that adds up to 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13, which is less than 16. Clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nAh, I see\u2014the error is that I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me do it correctly by listing all 16 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1, 2, 4 \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain-brown: Cases 3, 7 \u2192 2 instances\n- Red-checkered: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain-checkered: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that adds up to 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9, but that's still under 16. I must be missing some cases.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 should have 16 possible genotypic combinations. Let me list all 16:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown\n10. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-checkered (wait, this is same as case 6)\n11. Cc bb \u2192 Red-checkered (same as case 5)\n12. cc BB \u2192 Plain-brown (same as case 3)\n13. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-brown (same as case 7)\n14. cc bb \u2192 Plain-brown (same as case 9)\n15. Cc BB \u2192 Red-brown (same as case 4)\n16. CC Bb \u2192 Red-brown (same as case 2)\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to use the phenotypic ratio instead. Since each gene has two possibilities, and they're independent, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by multiplying the probabilities.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Pigment (C): 50% C, 50% c\n- Color (B): 50% B, 50% b\n\nCombined, each phenotype has a certain probability:\n\n- Red-brown (C_B_): 25% (since both dominant)\n- Plain-brown (cc B_): 25%\n- Red-checkered (Cc bb): 25%\n- Plain-checkered (cc bb): 25%\n\nWait, that makes sense because each gene has a 50% chance of being present or absent, and the presence of each allele is independent.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. With 16 possible genotypic combinations, each phenotype would occur 4 times (since 16 / 4 = 4).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, meaning each phenotype has an equal occurrence.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says:\n\nPhenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that doesn't match our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014if each phenotype has 25% probability, then in 16 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4.\n\nBut none of the options seem to reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, option F says 4:4:4:4, which matches what I derived. So the correct answer should be F. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nBut wait, checking the options again, the user listed options A-F, with F being 4:4:4:4. So the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each bird, the phenotype could be:",
    "rollout": " So for each bird, the phenotype could be:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nSo four phenotypic categories. Now, the frequency of each category depends on the combination of the gamete probabilities. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the proportion of each gamete type: From the F1 (CcBb), each parent contributes either CB or cb. Since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are equally likely. So each gamete (CB and cb) occurs at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- 25% CC (all C from both parents)\n- 25% Cc (C from one parent, c from other)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n- 25% bb (all b)\n\nBut now, let's map this to phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 cc BB or cc Bb? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment is red.\n- If c is present (c_), then plain.\nSimilarly,\n- If B is present (B_), then brown.\n- If b is present (b_), then checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or not. So for each bird, the phenotype can be represented as (C, B) where each can be present or not. Thus, four possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. (Red, Brown) = (C_, B_)\n2. (Red, Checkered) = (C_, b_)\n3. (Plain, Brown) = (c_, B_)\n4. (Plain, Checkered) = (c_, b_)\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each class.\n\nStarting with (C_, B_):\nThis requires C_ (which is always true since C_ is dominant) and B_. \n\nThe probability of having C_ is 75% (since C can be from either parent and still be present). Similarly, the probability of B_ is 75%. Assuming independence, the combined probability is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\nNext, (C_, b_):\nHere, C_ is present (dominant), and b_ is present (recessive). \n\nProbability of C_ is 0.75, and probability of b_ is 0.25 (since b comes from each parent). Combined probability is 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nThird, (c_, B_):\nC_ must be absent (probability 0.25), and B_ must be present (0.75). Combined probability is 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nFourth, (c_, b_):\nBoth C_ must be absent (0.25) and b_ must be absent (0.25). Combined probability is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that each gene's presence is 50%, but that was for the F1 gametes. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me re-express the F2 probabilities correctly.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probabilities for each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being present or not.\n\nSo, for (C_, B_):\n\nP(C_) = 0.75 (from CC and Cc)\nP(B_) = 0.75 (from BB and Bb)\nCombined: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nFor (C_, b_):\n\nP(C_) = 0.75\nP(b_) = 0.25 (from bb)\nCombined: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nFor (c_, B_):\n\nP(c_) = 0.25 (from cc)\nP(B_) = 0.75\nCombined: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nFor (c_, b_):\n\nP(c_) = 0.25\nP(b_) = 0.25\nCombined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these percentages into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- (C_, B_): ~56.25 : \n- (C_, b_): ~18.75 :\n- (c_, B_): ~18.75 :\n- (c_, b_): ~6.25 :\n\nTo express this as whole numbers, multiply each percentage by 16 to eliminate decimals (since 1/16 \u2248 0.0625, but perhaps another approach is better).\n\nAlternatively, notice that the ratios can be expressed as fractions over 100:\n\n56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nDivide each term by 6.25 to simplify:\n\n(56.25 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (6.25 / 6.25)\nWhich is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16 parts. That seems consistent.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But according to our calculation, it's 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the probabilities. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. For example, does 'c' being present mean plain regardless of B? Yes, because B controls color, so even if B is present, it doesn't matter\u2014it's brown. Only when B is absent does the color change to checkered.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was correct, leading to 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That sums to 5+3+2+6=16. Our calculation gave 9:3:3:1, which also sums to 16. So none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the question expects us to consider only one phenotype as the base, such as red versus non-red, and similarly for brown vs. non-brown. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we take red as the dominant phenotype for pigment and brown as the dominant for color, then the phenotypes can be grouped as follows:\n\n- Both traits are dominant (C and B): red and brown\n- Pigment dominant, color recessive (C and b): red and checkered\n- Pigment recessive, color dominant (c and B): plain and brown\n- Pigment recessive, color recessive (c and b): plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities:\n\nFrom before, the probabilities were:\n\n- (C_, B_): 56.25%\n- (C_, b_): 18.75%\n- (c_, B_): 18.75%\n- (c_, b_): 6.25%\n\nAssuming a population of 16 individuals, we'd expect approximately:\n\n- 56.25 * 16 = 900\n- 18.75 * 16 = 300\n- 18.75 * 16 = 300\n- 6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nBut scaling up might not help directly. Instead, let's see what the actual counts are. The exact ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would translate to 9, 3, 3, 1 units. Adding them up, 9+3+3+1=16. So the actual number of each phenotype in a sample of 16 birds would be 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. But none of the options seem to reflect this directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the options group phenotypes differently. Looking back:\n\nOption G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 summing to 16. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2014 summing to 16 as well. Our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options perfectly. Maybe I made an error in determining the phenotypic groups.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider how the phenotypes are defined. Let me redefine the phenotypes correctly:\n\n- (C_, B_): Checkered and Brown (but wait, no. Because if C is present (red), and B is present (brown), then the phenotype is red and brown, i.e., brown). If C is present (red) and B is absent (checkered), then the phenotype is red and checkered. Similarly, if C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown), phenotype is plain and brown. If both are absent, phenotype is plain and checkered.)\n\nThus, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_ and b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nOur previous calculations were correct, giving 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25% respectively. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, perhaps the question expects us to count only the dominant traits without considering the recessive ones. For instance, treating \"plain\" as a separate phenotype from \"red,\" and similarly for \"brown\" and \"checkered.\" In that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- (C_, B_): red and brown\n- (C_, b_): red and checkered\n- (c_, B_): plain and brown\n- (c_, b_): plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype relative to the others, ignoring the recessive cases:\n\nTotal red and brown: 56.25%\nTotal red and checkered: 18.75%\nTotal plain and brown: 18.75%\nTotal plain and checkered: 6.25%\n\nExpressed as a ratio among themselves, it would be 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 9\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n6.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But again, this doesn't match the answer options exactly. Let's look again at the options:\n\nLooking for an option that matches 9:3:3:1. None of the options A through J exactly do that. However, perhaps the options are grouping phenotypes differently, such as considering only one trait at a time. For example, perhaps they're grouping red and brown together and plain and brown separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive traits and count the dominant ones. For example, treating \"plain\" as a separate phenotype from \"red,\" and similarly \"checkered\" as a separate from \"brown.\"\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- (C_, B_): red and brown \u2192 56.25%\n- (C_, b_): red and checkered \u2192 18.75%\n- (c_, B_): plain and brown \u2192 18.75%\n- (c_, b_): plain and checkered \u2192 6.25%\n\nAs previously established, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options provide this. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum:16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum:16. This seems close but different from our 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the dominant traits, making the ratio 3:1 for each trait. For example, for pigment, red is dominant, so the phenotypes would be red (if pigment is present) and plain (if pigment is absent). Similarly for color, brown is dominant, so phenotypes are brown and plain.\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would be (for each trait alone):\n\nRed (C present) : Plain (C absent) \u2192 75% : 25% \u2192 3:1\n\nSimilarly for color:\n\nBrown (B present) : Plain (B absent) \u2192 75% : 25% \u2192 3:1\n\nHowever, combining these, the phenotypic ratios become 3:1 for pigment and 3:1 for color. The interaction of these would create a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to our original calculation.\n\nBut again, none of the answer options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2013 sum 16. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2013 sum 16. Close, but not exact.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2013 sum 16, but reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are counted. Maybe the options are presenting the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, rather than absolute counts. Let me recalculate:\n\nUsing the probabilities:\n\n- (C_, B_): 56.25% \u2192 9\n- (C_, b_): 18.75% \u2192 3\n- (c_, B_): 18.75% \u2192 3\n- (c_, b_): 6.25% \u2192 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none match this exactly. However, option G presents 12:2:2:0, which is 16, but it doesn't align with our calculation. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is also 16 but doesn't fit either.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype could be:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nSo four phenotypic categories. Now, the frequency of each category depends on the combination of the gamete probabilities. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the proportion of each gamete type: From the F1 (CcBb), each parent contributes either CB or cb. Since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are equally likely. So each gamete (CB and cb) occurs at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- 25% CC (all C from both parents)\n- 25% Cc (C from one parent, c from other)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n- 25% bb (all b)\n\nBut now, let's map this to phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 cc BB or cc Bb? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment is red.\n- If c is present (c_), then plain.\nSimilarly,\n- If B is present (B_), then brown.\n- If b is present (b_), then checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or not. So for each bird, the phenotype can be represented as (C, B) where each can be present or not. Thus, four possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. (Red, Brown) = (C_, B_)\n2. (Red, Checkered) = (C_, b_)\n3. (Plain, Brown) = (c_, B_)\n4. (Plain, Checkered) = (c_, b_)\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each class.\n\nStarting with (C_, B_):\nThis requires C_ (which is always true since C_ is dominant) and B_. \n\nThe probability of having C_ is 75% (since C can be from either parent and still be present). Similarly, the probability of B_ is 75%. Assuming independence, the combined probability is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\nNext, (C_, b_):\nHere, C_ is present (dominant), and b_ is present (recessive). \n\nProbability of C_ is 0.75, and probability of b_ is 0.25 (since b comes from each parent). Combined probability is 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nThird, (c_, B_):\nC_ must be absent (probability 0.25), and B_ must be present (0.75). Combined probability is 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nFourth, (c_, b_):\nBoth C_ must be absent (0.25) and b_ must be absent (0.25). Combined probability is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that each gene's presence is 50%, but that was for the F1 gametes. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me re-express the F2 probabilities correctly.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probabilities for each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being present or not.\n\nSo, for (C_, B_):\n\nP(C_) = 0.75 (from CC and Cc)\nP(B_) = 0.75 (from BB and Bb)\nCombined: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nFor (C_, b_):\n\nP(C_) = 0.75\nP(b_) = 0.25 (from bb)\nCombined: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nFor (c_, B_):\n\nP(c_) = 0.25 (from cc)\nP(B_) = 0.75\nCombined: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nFor (c_, b_):\n\nP(c_) = 0.25\nP(b_) = 0.25\nCombined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these percentages into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- (C_, B_): ~56.25 : \n- (C_, b_): ~18.75 :\n- (c_, B_): ~18.75 :\n- (c_, b_): ~6.25 :\n\nTo express this as whole numbers, multiply each percentage by 16 to eliminate decimals (since 1/16 \u2248 0.0625, but perhaps another approach is better).\n\nAlternatively, notice that the ratios can be expressed as fractions over 100:\n\n56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nDivide each term by 6.25 to simplify:\n\n(56.25 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (18.75 / 6.25) : (6.25 / 6.25)\nWhich is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16 parts. That seems consistent.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But according to our calculation, it's 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the probabilities. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. For example, does 'c' being present mean plain regardless of B? Yes, because B controls color, so even if B is present, it doesn't matter\u2014it's brown. Only when B is absent does the color change to checkered.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was correct, leading to 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That sums to 5+3+2+6=16. Our calculation gave 9:3:3:1, which also sums to 16. So none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the question expects us to consider only one phenotype as the base, such as red versus non-red, and similarly for brown vs. non-brown. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we take red as the dominant phenotype for pigment and brown as the dominant for color, then the phenotypes can be grouped as follows:\n\n- Both traits are dominant (C and B): red and brown\n- Pigment dominant, color recessive (C and b): red and checkered\n- Pigment recessive, color dominant (c and B): plain and brown\n- Pigment recessive, color recessive (c and b): plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities:\n\nFrom before, the probabilities were:\n\n- (C_, B_): 56.25%\n- (C_, b_): 18.75%\n- (c_, B_): 18.75%\n- (c_, b_): 6.25%\n\nAssuming a population of 16 individuals, we'd expect approximately:\n\n- 56.25 * 16 = 900\n- 18.75 * 16 = 300\n- 18.75 * 16 = 300\n- 6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nBut scaling up might not help directly. Instead, let's see what the actual counts are. The exact ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would translate to 9, 3, 3, 1 units. Adding them up, 9+3+3+1=16. So the actual number of each phenotype in a sample of 16 birds would be 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. But none of the options seem to reflect this directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the options group phenotypes differently. Looking back:\n\nOption G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 summing to 16. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2014 summing to 16 as well. Our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options perfectly. Maybe I made an error in determining the phenotypic groups.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider how the phenotypes are defined. Let me redefine the phenotypes correctly:\n\n- (C_, B_): Checkered and Brown (but wait, no. Because if C is present (red), and B is present (brown), then the phenotype is red and brown, i.e., brown). If C is present (red) and B is absent (checkered), then the phenotype is red and checkered. Similarly, if C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown), phenotype is plain and brown. If both are absent, phenotype is plain and checkered.)\n\nThus, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_ and b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nOur previous calculations were correct, giving 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25% respectively. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, perhaps the question expects us to count only the dominant traits without considering the recessive ones. For instance, treating \"plain\" as a separate phenotype from \"red,\" and similarly for \"brown\" and \"checkered.\" In that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- (C_, B_): red and brown\n- (C_, b_): red and checkered\n- (c_, B_): plain and brown\n- (c_, b_): plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype relative to the others, ignoring the recessive cases:\n\nTotal red and brown: 56.25%\nTotal red and checkered: 18.75%\nTotal plain and brown: 18.75%\nTotal plain and checkered: 6.25%\n\nExpressed as a ratio among themselves, it would be 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 9\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n18.75 \u00f7 6.25 = 3\n6.25 \u00f7 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But again, this doesn't match the answer options exactly. Let's look again at the options:\n\nLooking for an option that matches 9:3:3:1. None of the options A through J exactly do that. However, perhaps the options are grouping phenotypes differently, such as considering only one trait at a time. For example, perhaps they're grouping red and brown together and plain and brown separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive traits and count the dominant ones. For example, treating \"plain\" as a separate phenotype from \"red,\" and similarly \"checkered\" as a separate from \"brown.\"\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- (C_, B_): red and brown \u2192 56.25%\n- (C_, b_): red and checkered \u2192 18.75%\n- (c_, B_): plain and brown \u2192 18.75%\n- (c_, b_): plain and checkered \u2192 6.25%\n\nAs previously established, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options provide this. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum:16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum:16. This seems close but different from our 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the dominant traits, making the ratio 3:1 for each trait. For example, for pigment, red is dominant, so the phenotypes would be red (if pigment is present) and plain (if pigment is absent). Similarly for color, brown is dominant, so phenotypes are brown and plain.\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would be (for each trait alone):\n\nRed (C present) : Plain (C absent) \u2192 75% : 25% \u2192 3:1\n\nSimilarly for color:\n\nBrown (B present) : Plain (B absent) \u2192 75% : 25% \u2192 3:1\n\nHowever, combining these, the phenotypic ratios become 3:1 for pigment and 3:1 for color. The interaction of these would create a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to our original calculation.\n\nBut again, none of the answer options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2013 sum 16. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2013 sum 16. Close, but not exact.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2013 sum 16, but reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are counted. Maybe the options are presenting the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, rather than absolute counts. Let me recalculate:\n\nUsing the probabilities:\n\n- (C_, B_): 56.25% \u2192 9\n- (C_, b_): 18.75% \u2192 3\n- (c_, B_): 18.75% \u2192 3\n- (c_, b_): 6.25% \u2192 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none match this exactly. However, option G presents 12:2:2:0, which is 16, but it doesn't align with our calculation. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is also 16 but doesn't fit either.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "rollout": " So for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Checkered red (C is recessive, c is dominant; B is recessive, b is dominant)\nWait, no. Wait, the genes are C and B. Pigment color is determined by C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain). Body color is determined by B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered). So the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: red brown (checkered?) Wait, no. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it's red. If not, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if at least one B allele, it's brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB)\n2. Checkered brown (cb)\n3. Plain red (Cc)\n4. Plain brown (Cb)\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratios, we need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. To do this, we'll use the fact that each bird's alleles are inherited independently. \n\nEach parent's gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% probability. So, the F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, we need to map these genotypes to phenotypes. Let's look at each genotype:\n\n1. CC (C is present): \n   - Pigment: red (since C is dominant)\n   - Body: brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown (but wait, C is dominant, so pigment is red; B is dominant, so body is brown. The presence of either dominant allele makes the bird either red or brown, depending on which gene is active.)\n\nWait, but in terms of pigmentation, the bird is either red or plain, regardless of body color. Similarly, for body color, it's either brown or checkered. So:\n\nFor each genotype, we can determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC: Pigment is red, body is brown \u2192 Checkered brown (since C is present, B is present)\n- Cc: Pigment is red (since C is dominant), body is brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc: Pigment is plain (since c is recessive), body is brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb: Pigment is plain, body is checkered (since b is recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the four genotypes correspond directly to four phenotypes: Checkered brown, Checkered brown, Plain brown, Plain brown. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because in reality, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 red (pigment) and brown (body) \u2192 Checkered brown (because C is dominant for pigment, but B is also present)\n- Cc \u2192 same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 plain (no C) and brown (B present) \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb \u2192 plain (no B) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, in the F2 population:\n\n- 25% are CC \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% are Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% are cc \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% are bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the options given. The options suggest different ratios, like checkered red, plain red, etc. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I got the genes reversed. Maybe the order is important. The problem states:\n\n- Checkered = recessive allele c\n- Red = dominant allele C\n- Plain = recessive allele c\n- Brown = dominant allele B\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered is when both c and c (since c is recessive and dominant for the animal's color, which is determined by c). Wait, no\u2014the animal's color is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So, if the animal has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) or for body color (B), it has the desired color. Otherwise, it has the undesired one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the letters are assigned differently. The problem says:\n\n- Checkered is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Red is determined by dominant allele C.\n- Plain is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Brown is determined by dominant allele B.\n\nSo, for the animal's color:\n\n- If the animal has at least one dominant C allele, it's red.\n- If it has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown.\n- If it has at least one recessive c allele, it's checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for pigment:\n\n- Pigmented animals have at least one dominant C allele.\n- Non-pigmented have at least one recessive c.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased seems to imply that the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective traits. So, let's re-express the possible phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Checkered \u2192 c (recessive for pigment) and c (recessive for body color)\n2. Red \u2192 C (dominant for pigment) and anything (since B is dominant, even if b is present, it's still brown)\n3. Plain \u2192 c (recessive for pigment) and b (dominant for body color)\n4. Brown \u2192 B (dominant for body color) and anything\n\nWait, but this may complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether the animal is checkered or not (which depends on having at least one recessive allele for pigment) and whether it's brown or not (determined by having at least one dominant allele for body color).\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes could be:\n\n- Checkered: has at least one c (so, either cB, cb, ccB, or cc b?), no\u2014wait, the animals' color is determined by pigment. So, if an animal has at least one c allele, it's checkered. If it has at least one B allele, it's brown. Otherwise, it's red (for pigment) and plain (for body).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether the animal is checkered or not, and whether it's brown or not. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Pigment color: determined by C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: determined by B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, for pigment:\n\n- Presence of C \u2192 red\n- Absence of C \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Presence of B \u2192 brown\n- Absence of B \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. Only pigment dominant (C and b) \u2192 Plain brown\n3. Only body dominant (c and B) \u2192 Checkered brown (since B is present)\n4. Neither dominant \u2192 C (plain) and c (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no\u2014if an animal has C (pigment dominant) and B (body dominant), then it's Checkered brown. If it has C and b, it's Plain brown. If it has c and B, it's Checkered brown (since B is present, despite being recessive). If it has c and c, it's Plain red.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown (C and B)\n- Plain brown (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain red (c and c)\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because if you have C and B, it's Checkered brown. If you have C and b, it's Plain brown. If you have c and B, it's Checkered brown. And if you have c and c, it's Plain red.\n\nSo, in terms of counts:\n\n- Checkered brown: (C and B) and (c and B)\n- Plain brown: (C and b)\n- Checkered brown: (c and B)\n- Plain red: (c and c)\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Perhaps a better way is to consider the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C and C):\n   - Pigment: red (has C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n2. Cc (C and c):\n   - Pigment: red (has C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. cc (c and c):\n   - Pigment: plain (no C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. Cb (C and b):\n   - Pigment: red (has C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nWait, this suggests that most of the C-bearing individuals are Checkered brown, except those without C. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count based on the number of each genotype. In F2, each of the four possible genotypes occurs with the following frequency:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd for each genotype, the phenotype is determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating this. Instead, let me consider the possible phenotypic ratios based on dominance. Since each trait is determined by a single gene, and the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the dominance hierarchy for each trait.\n\nHowever, since both traits are determined by separate genes, the phenotypic ratio might involve multiplying the individual ratios for each trait. Let's see:\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of two traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and c for pigment; B and b for body)\n2. Checkered brown (C and c for pigment; B and b for body)\n3. Plain red (c for pigment; B and b for body)\n4. Plain brown (c for pigment; B and b for body)\n\nWait, but this approach isn't working because some phenotypes overlap. Actually, the correct way is to realize that each bird can be classified based on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait. \n\nSo, for pigment color:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele \u2192 red\n- Else \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele \u2192 brown\n- Else \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the two traits are determined by independent genes, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the combinations of these traits.\n\nLet me construct a table for each F2 bird:\n\n1. If the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. If the bird has at least one C and at least one b \u2192 Plain brown\n3. If the bird has at least one c and at least one B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. If the bird has at least one c and at least one b \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but this seems overlapping. For example, a bird with C and B would fit both Checkered brown (if B is present) and possibly another category. This indicates that I need to reconsider how I categorize the phenotypes.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird can be classified as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: cB (both recessive for pigment and body)\n- Checkered brown: cb (recessive for pigment, dominant for body)\n- Plain brown: Cb (dominant for pigment, recessive for body)\n- Plain red: cc (recessive for both traits)\n\nYes, this makes sense. So, each bird falls into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc\n2. Checkered brown: cb\n3. Plain brown: Cb\n4. Plain red: cc\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each:\n\n- Checkered red (cc): 25%\n- Checkered brown (cb): 25%\n- Plain brown (Cb): 25%\n- Plain red (cc): 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but according to the options provided, none of them match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, option G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\"\n\nOption H: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nOption I: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nOption J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nHmm, my calculation shows each phenotype is 25%, but none of the options match this exactly. However, looking closer, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red) > c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: B (dominant, brown) > b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, a bird with C (pigment) and B (body) \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nA bird with C and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nA bird with c and B \u2192 Checkered brown (since B is dominant)\n\nA bird with c and c \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the correct phenotypic ratios are indeed 25% each. But the options don't have 25% each. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 generation.\n\nWait, going back to the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C) \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc (some C, some c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% cc (all c) \u2192 Plain red\n\nBecause Cc is 50%, and the rest are CC and cc. Wait, no\u2014CC and cc are both 25% each, plus Cc is 50%.\n\nWait, no\u2014when you have a heterozygote (Cc), it can produce two types of gametes: C and c, each at 50%. So, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 25% CC (C from each parent)\n- 50% Cc (C from one parent and c from the other)\n- 25% cc (c from each parent)\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, and 25% Plain red.\n\nBut the options don't include 25% each. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption H: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption I: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nProblem statement: The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the cross. The adihybridcross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be Cc Bb, as previously thought. Then, the F2 would be from F1 (CcBb) selfing.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 generation after crossing with itself, i.e., F1 x F1, but the description says adihybridcross, which usually refers to a dihybrid cross between two different genotypes. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the cross between a CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 (Cc Bb), and then F2 would be from F1 selfing.\n\nWait, but in that case, the F2 would have the same genotypic distribution as before, leading to the phenotypic ratios as before: 25% each. However, the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for a selfing of F1, leading to F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was misstated, and the adihybridcross refers to a dihybrid cross between two different genotypes, resulting in F1, and then the F2 would come from F1 x F1. Let me try that.\n\nIf we cross a CC BB (homozygous checkered red) with a cc bb (homozygous plain brown):\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb, as previously determined.\n\nThen, F1 x F1 (selfing) would yield the same genotypic ratios as before:\n\n- 25% CC (C and C)\n- 25% Cc (C and c)\n- 25% cc (c and c)\n- 25% Cc (c and C)\n\nWait, no\u2014the selfing would lead to:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb), each gamete is C (50%) and B (50%). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- C (from parent1) and C (from parent",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Checkered red (C is recessive, c is dominant; B is recessive, b is dominant)\nWait, no. Wait, the genes are C and B. Pigment color is determined by C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain). Body color is determined by B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered). So the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: red brown (checkered?) Wait, no. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it's red. If not, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if at least one B allele, it's brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB)\n2. Checkered brown (cb)\n3. Plain red (Cc)\n4. Plain brown (Cb)\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratios, we need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. To do this, we'll use the fact that each bird's alleles are inherited independently. \n\nEach parent's gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% probability. So, the F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, we need to map these genotypes to phenotypes. Let's look at each genotype:\n\n1. CC (C is present): \n   - Pigment: red (since C is dominant)\n   - Body: brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown (but wait, C is dominant, so pigment is red; B is dominant, so body is brown. The presence of either dominant allele makes the bird either red or brown, depending on which gene is active.)\n\nWait, but in terms of pigmentation, the bird is either red or plain, regardless of body color. Similarly, for body color, it's either brown or checkered. So:\n\nFor each genotype, we can determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC: Pigment is red, body is brown \u2192 Checkered brown (since C is present, B is present)\n- Cc: Pigment is red (since C is dominant), body is brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc: Pigment is plain (since c is recessive), body is brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb: Pigment is plain, body is checkered (since b is recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the four genotypes correspond directly to four phenotypes: Checkered brown, Checkered brown, Plain brown, Plain brown. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because in reality, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 red (pigment) and brown (body) \u2192 Checkered brown (because C is dominant for pigment, but B is also present)\n- Cc \u2192 same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 plain (no C) and brown (B present) \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb \u2192 plain (no B) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, in the F2 population:\n\n- 25% are CC \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% are Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% are cc \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% are bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the options given. The options suggest different ratios, like checkered red, plain red, etc. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I got the genes reversed. Maybe the order is important. The problem states:\n\n- Checkered = recessive allele c\n- Red = dominant allele C\n- Plain = recessive allele c\n- Brown = dominant allele B\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered is when both c and c (since c is recessive and dominant for the animal's color, which is determined by c). Wait, no\u2014the animal's color is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So, if the animal has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) or for body color (B), it has the desired color. Otherwise, it has the undesired one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the letters are assigned differently. The problem says:\n\n- Checkered is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Red is determined by dominant allele C.\n- Plain is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Brown is determined by dominant allele B.\n\nSo, for the animal's color:\n\n- If the animal has at least one dominant C allele, it's red.\n- If it has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown.\n- If it has at least one recessive c allele, it's checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for pigment:\n\n- Pigmented animals have at least one dominant C allele.\n- Non-pigmented have at least one recessive c.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased seems to imply that the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective traits. So, let's re-express the possible phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Checkered \u2192 c (recessive for pigment) and c (recessive for body color)\n2. Red \u2192 C (dominant for pigment) and anything (since B is dominant, even if b is present, it's still brown)\n3. Plain \u2192 c (recessive for pigment) and b (dominant for body color)\n4. Brown \u2192 B (dominant for body color) and anything\n\nWait, but this may complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether the animal is checkered or not (which depends on having at least one recessive allele for pigment) and whether it's brown or not (determined by having at least one dominant allele for body color).\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes could be:\n\n- Checkered: has at least one c (so, either cB, cb, ccB, or cc b?), no\u2014wait, the animals' color is determined by pigment. So, if an animal has at least one c allele, it's checkered. If it has at least one B allele, it's brown. Otherwise, it's red (for pigment) and plain (for body).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether the animal is checkered or not, and whether it's brown or not. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Pigment color: determined by C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: determined by B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, for pigment:\n\n- Presence of C \u2192 red\n- Absence of C \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Presence of B \u2192 brown\n- Absence of B \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. Only pigment dominant (C and b) \u2192 Plain brown\n3. Only body dominant (c and B) \u2192 Checkered brown (since B is present)\n4. Neither dominant \u2192 C (plain) and c (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no\u2014if an animal has C (pigment dominant) and B (body dominant), then it's Checkered brown. If it has C and b, it's Plain brown. If it has c and B, it's Checkered brown (since B is present, despite being recessive). If it has c and c, it's Plain red.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown (C and B)\n- Plain brown (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain red (c and c)\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because if you have C and B, it's Checkered brown. If you have C and b, it's Plain brown. If you have c and B, it's Checkered brown. And if you have c and c, it's Plain red.\n\nSo, in terms of counts:\n\n- Checkered brown: (C and B) and (c and B)\n- Plain brown: (C and b)\n- Checkered brown: (c and B)\n- Plain red: (c and c)\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Perhaps a better way is to consider the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C and C):\n   - Pigment: red (has C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n2. Cc (C and c):\n   - Pigment: red (has C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. cc (c and c):\n   - Pigment: plain (no C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. Cb (C and b):\n   - Pigment: red (has C)\n   - Body: brown (has B)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nWait, this suggests that most of the C-bearing individuals are Checkered brown, except those without C. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count based on the number of each genotype. In F2, each of the four possible genotypes occurs with the following frequency:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd for each genotype, the phenotype is determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating this. Instead, let me consider the possible phenotypic ratios based on dominance. Since each trait is determined by a single gene, and the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the dominance hierarchy for each trait.\n\nHowever, since both traits are determined by separate genes, the phenotypic ratio might involve multiplying the individual ratios for each trait. Let's see:\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of two traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and c for pigment; B and b for body)\n2. Checkered brown (C and c for pigment; B and b for body)\n3. Plain red (c for pigment; B and b for body)\n4. Plain brown (c for pigment; B and b for body)\n\nWait, but this approach isn't working because some phenotypes overlap. Actually, the correct way is to realize that each bird can be classified based on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait. \n\nSo, for pigment color:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele \u2192 red\n- Else \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele \u2192 brown\n- Else \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the two traits are determined by independent genes, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the combinations of these traits.\n\nLet me construct a table for each F2 bird:\n\n1. If the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. If the bird has at least one C and at least one b \u2192 Plain brown\n3. If the bird has at least one c and at least one B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. If the bird has at least one c and at least one b \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but this seems overlapping. For example, a bird with C and B would fit both Checkered brown (if B is present) and possibly another category. This indicates that I need to reconsider how I categorize the phenotypes.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird can be classified as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: cB (both recessive for pigment and body)\n- Checkered brown: cb (recessive for pigment, dominant for body)\n- Plain brown: Cb (dominant for pigment, recessive for body)\n- Plain red: cc (recessive for both traits)\n\nYes, this makes sense. So, each bird falls into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc\n2. Checkered brown: cb\n3. Plain brown: Cb\n4. Plain red: cc\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each:\n\n- Checkered red (cc): 25%\n- Checkered brown (cb): 25%\n- Plain brown (Cb): 25%\n- Plain red (cc): 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but according to the options provided, none of them match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, option G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\"\n\nOption H: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nOption I: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nOption J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nHmm, my calculation shows each phenotype is 25%, but none of the options match this exactly. However, looking closer, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red) > c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: B (dominant, brown) > b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, a bird with C (pigment) and B (body) \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nA bird with C and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nA bird with c and B \u2192 Checkered brown (since B is dominant)\n\nA bird with c and c \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the correct phenotypic ratios are indeed 25% each. But the options don't have 25% each. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 generation.\n\nWait, going back to the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C) \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc (some C, some c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% cc (all c) \u2192 Plain red\n\nBecause Cc is 50%, and the rest are CC and cc. Wait, no\u2014CC and cc are both 25% each, plus Cc is 50%.\n\nWait, no\u2014when you have a heterozygote (Cc), it can produce two types of gametes: C and c, each at 50%. So, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 25% CC (C from each parent)\n- 50% Cc (C from one parent and c from the other)\n- 25% cc (c from each parent)\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are 25% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, and 25% Plain red.\n\nBut the options don't include 25% each. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption H: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption I: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nProblem statement: The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the cross. The adihybridcross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be Cc Bb, as previously thought. Then, the F2 would be from F1 (CcBb) selfing.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 generation after crossing with itself, i.e., F1 x F1, but the description says adihybridcross, which usually refers to a dihybrid cross between two different genotypes. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the cross between a CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 (Cc Bb), and then F2 would be from F1 selfing.\n\nWait, but in that case, the F2 would have the same genotypic distribution as before, leading to the phenotypic ratios as before: 25% each. However, the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for a selfing of F1, leading to F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was misstated, and the adihybridcross refers to a dihybrid cross between two different genotypes, resulting in F1, and then the F2 would come from F1 x F1. Let me try that.\n\nIf we cross a CC BB (homozygous checkered red) with a cc bb (homozygous plain brown):\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb, as previously determined.\n\nThen, F1 x F1 (selfing) would yield the same genotypic ratios as before:\n\n- 25% CC (C and C)\n- 25% Cc (C and c)\n- 25% cc (c and c)\n- 25% Cc (c and C)\n\nWait, no\u2014the selfing would lead to:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb), each gamete is C (50%) and B (50%). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- C (from parent1) and C (from parent",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the number of phenotypic categories is 2 (pigment) x 2 (body) = 4.",
    "rollout": " So the number of phenotypic categories is 2 (pigment) x 2 (body) = 4. Each category corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nSo, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C is present, B is absent)\n2. Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n3. Plain red (c is present, B absent)\n4. Plain brown (c present, B present)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC (C present): 25%\n- Cc (C present): 50% (since Cc occurs in 2 cases: CB and Cc)\n- cc (c present): 25%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- BB (B present): 25%\n- Bb (B present): 50%\n- bb (b present): 25%\n\nBut since the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability. So for example, the probability of being C (present) AND B (present) is 25% * 25% = 6.25%. Similarly for other combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because for each gene, the probability of having C present is 75%, and B present is 75%. So the probability of being C present AND B present is (0.75)*(0.75)=0.5625, or 56.25%. Similarly, C present AND B absent: 0.75*0.25=0.1875 (18.75%). And so on for the others.\n\nLet me tabulate all combinations:\n\n1. C present AND B present: (0.75)(0.75)=0.5625 \u2192 Checkered brown (56.25%)\n2. C present AND B absent: (0.75)(0.25)=0.1875 \u2192 Checkered red (18.75%)\n3. C absent AND B present: (0.25)(0.75)=0.1875 \u2192 Plain brown (18.75%)\n4. C absent AND B absent: (0.25)(0.25)=0.0625 \u2192 Plain red (6.25%)\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25, which simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 when scaled by a factor of 16 (since 56.25/6.25=9, etc.).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the number of phenotypic categories is 2 (pigment) x 2 (body) = 4. Each category corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nSo, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C is present, B is absent)\n2. Checkered brown (C present, B present)\n3. Plain red (c is present, B absent)\n4. Plain brown (c present, B present)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC (C present): 25%\n- Cc (C present): 50% (since Cc occurs in 2 cases: CB and Cc)\n- cc (c present): 25%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- BB (B present): 25%\n- Bb (B present): 50%\n- bb (b present): 25%\n\nBut since the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability. So for example, the probability of being C (present) AND B (present) is 25% * 25% = 6.25%. Similarly for other combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because for each gene, the probability of having C present is 75%, and B present is 75%. So the probability of being C present AND B present is (0.75)*(0.75)=0.5625, or 56.25%. Similarly, C present AND B absent: 0.75*0.25=0.1875 (18.75%). And so on for the others.\n\nLet me tabulate all combinations:\n\n1. C present AND B present: (0.75)(0.75)=0.5625 \u2192 Checkered brown (56.25%)\n2. C present AND B absent: (0.75)(0.25)=0.1875 \u2192 Checkered red (18.75%)\n3. C absent AND B present: (0.25)(0.75)=0.1875 \u2192 Plain brown (18.75%)\n4. C absent AND B absent: (0.25)(0.25)=0.0625 \u2192 Plain red (6.25%)\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25, which simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 when scaled by a factor of 16 (since 56.25/6.25=9, etc.). So, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 No\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 No\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 No\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 All same, no\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2013 No\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2013 No\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2013 No\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2013 No\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 No\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: Phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " However, since each gene is determined by dominance, each trait will have three phenotypes: presence of the dominant allele (for pigment and color).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to approach this by determining the possible phenotypes and then calculating the frequency based on the Punnett square.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles it receives for both genes. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pigment color (C):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (either C/C, C/c), it will display red (dominant).\n- If it has two c alleles (cc), it will display plain (recessive).\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (BB or Bb), it will display brown.\n- If it has two b alleles (bb), it will display checkered.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Red (C) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n3. Red (C) and Checkered (b): Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n5. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n6. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n7. Checkered (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nBut wait, this seems off. Because if a bird has at least one C, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B, it's brown. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene contributes the dominant allele. So the possible phenotypes are combinations where either pigment is present, or color is present, or both.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (due to C) and Brown (due to B): Checkered red\n2. Red (C) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n3. Red (C) and Checkered (b): Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n5. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n6. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n7. Checkered (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, that's seven phenotypes. Hmm, but some might overlap. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count how many of the F2 individuals exhibit each phenotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 genotypes are equally likely among the four possible genotypes (assuming independent assortment and random fertilization), each with a probability of 25%, but each genotype may correspond to different phenotypes depending on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct a Punnett square showing the possible combinations and then determine the phenotypes.\n\nBut given that the answer choices don't include 7 phenotypes, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating each trait separately, leading to four possible phenotypes instead of seven. Maybe the problem assumes that only two traits are considered, each with three phenotypes, but that doesn't make sense because each bird has two traits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats each gene separately and combines them multiplicatively, resulting in four possible phenotypic combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the number of birds exhibiting each phenotype based on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of four possible genotypes, each with a certain probability:\n\n- CC BB (Red and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb (Red and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- CC bb (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- Cc BB (Checkered and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Cc Bb (Checkered and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc BB (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc bb (Plain and Plain): Phenotype: Plain Red\n\nWait, that's nine possibilities, but each with different phenotypes. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, let's count how many fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 4 birds (positions 2, 4, 5, 7)\n- Plain Brown: 4 birds (positions 3, 6, 8, 9)\n- Plain Red: 1 bird\n\nBut according to the options, none of them seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. Perhaps the initial assumption is that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of dominant alleles, but without considering the exact counts, perhaps the answer expects a simplified approach, such as counting the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance within each gene and consider only the presence of dominant alleles across both genes. That is, any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment or color will express the corresponding trait.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant color: Checkered Red\n2. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Checkered Brown\n3. At least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant color: Checkered Brown (same as above)\n4. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Plain Brown\n5. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Checkered Brown\n6. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Plain Brown\n7. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Checkered Brown\n8. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Plain Brown\n9. All recessive: Plain Red\n\nThis still leads to seven phenotypes, which complicates the answer choices. Given the options provided, perhaps the intended approach is to consider each gene independently and combine their effects, leading to four phenotypic categories: Red, Brown, Checkered, and Plain. Each category corresponds to having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nUnder this interpretation, let's reevaluate:\n\n- Checkered Red: Both Pigment and Color are dominant\n- Checkered Brown: Pigment dominant, Color recessive\n- Plain Brown: Pigment recessive, Color dominant\n- Plain Red: Both Pigment and Color recessive\n\nNow, we'll calculate how many F2 birds fall into each category.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, we had:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Red: 1 bird\n\nWhich totals 1+4+4+1 = 10 birds, but this isn't directly helpful. Instead, let's look at the possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for each F2 bird, we can assess whether:\n\n- They have at least one C (for pigment) and at least one B (for color), leading to Checkered Red.\n\n- They have at least one C and at least one b (for color), leading to Checkered Brown.\n\n- They have at least one c (for pigment) and at least one B, leading to Plain Brown.\n\n- They have at least one c and at least one b, leading to Plain Red.\n\nAdditionally, if they have no dominant alleles, they'd be Plain Red.\n\nWait, but in our earlier analysis, the numbers were 1, 4, 4, 1, totaling 10. But perhaps each bird can only be one type, so the actual counts would be as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Red: 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:4:4:1, which adds up to 10 birds. But looking at the answer options, none of them match this exactly. However, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option E suggests 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Again, not matching our count.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, same issue.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let's try another angle. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes, we can model the possible phenotypes as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nPhenotype 2: Either C is dominant or B is dominant, but not both \u2192 Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for pigment OR for color determines the phenotype, not both. So:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present \u2192 Phenotype is determined by the dominant allele, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more precise than that. The presence of a dominant allele in either gene results in that trait being expressed. So:\n\n- If at least one dominant C (C or C) \u2192 Pigment is brown\n- If at least one dominant B (B or b) \u2192 Color is brown\n- Otherwise, if neither is present \u2192 Both are plain\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. At least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. At least one dominant C and at least one recessive B \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. At least one recessive C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. At least one recessive C and at least one recessive B \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category.\n\nTotal F2 birds: 9 (since 3^2=9)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 This includes:\n\n   - C/B: 3 (from C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b?) Wait, no. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n   The F2 genotypes are:\n\n   - CC BB: Checkered Red\n   - CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n   - CC bb: Plain Brown\n   - Cc BB: Checkered Brown\n   - Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n   - Cc bb: Plain Brown\n   - cc BB: Plain Brown\n   - cc Bb: Plain Brown\n   - cc bb: Plain Red\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CR):\n   - Only CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n\n2. Checkered Brown (CB):\n   - CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, CC BB?\n   Wait, let's see:\n\n   - CC BB \u2192 CR\n   - CC Bb \u2192 CB\n   - CC bb \u2192 PB\n   - Cc BB \u2192 CB\n   - Cc Bb \u2192 CB\n   - Cc bb \u2192 PB\n   - cc BB \u2192 PB\n   - cc Bb \u2192 PB\n   - cc bb \u2192 PR\n\n   So CB: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\n\n3. Plain Brown (PB):\n   - CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n\n4. Plain Red (PR):\n   - Only cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3\n- PB: 3\n- PR: 1\n\nAdding up to 8 birds, missing one. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 CR\n- CC Bb \u2192 CB\n- CC bb \u2192 PB\n- Cc BB \u2192 CB\n- Cc Bb \u2192 CB\n- Cc bb \u2192 PB\n- cc BB \u2192 PB\n- cc Bb \u2192 PB\n- cc bb \u2192 PR\n\nSo indeed:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- PB: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n- PR: 1\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CR \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- PB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- PR \u2192 Plain Red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which sums to 16, which doesn't align. Option E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That sums to 16. Option D: 1, 6, 2, 1. That sums to 10. Option J: 2, 6, 3, 1. Sums to 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me double-check the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nParental cross: F1 (Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb) \u2192 F2.\n\nThe possible gametes are:\n\n- From Cc: C and c\n- From BB: B and b (but BB is homozygous, so only B)\n- From cc: c and c (only c)\n- From bb: b and b (only b)\n\nSo F2 genotypes come from combining these:\n\nPossible combinations are:\n\n1. C from Cc \u00d7 B from BB \u2192 CB\n2.

Cb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. cB \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. cb \u2192 Plain Brown (both recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (CB, Cb) \u2192 50%\n- Plain Brown (cB, cb) \u2192 50%\n\nNow, among the checkered phenotypes, how many have at least one dominant B?\n\n- CB: Yes (B is dominant)\n- Cb: Yes (B is dominant)\n- cB: No (B is recessive)\n- cb: No (B is recessive)\n\nSo, half of the checkered phenotype are Checkered Brown, and half are Plain Brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the checkered pigment (C is dominant), all the checkered phenotypes have C present.\n\nSo, now, focusing on the phenotypic ratios based on dominance:\n\n- Checkered Brown (from CB and Cb): These birds will have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, hence their phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n\n- Plain Brown (from cB and cb): These birds have at least one recessive C and at least one dominant B, hence their phenotype is Plain Brown.\n\nTherefore, in terms of phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 50% of the F2 population\n- Plain Brown: 50% of the F2 population\n\nWithin each group:\n\n- Among Checkered Brown, all have at least one dominant B, so their phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n\n- Among Plain Brown, all have at least one recessive C, so their phenotype is Plain Brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 (Checkered Brown : Plain Brown), but this doesn't account for dominance within the genes. However, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio based on the dominant alleles, we can say that half the F2 are Checkered Brown and half are Plain Brown, giving a ratio of 1:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly state 1:1. However, the closest option that accounts for dominance is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Which suggests a 12:2:2:0 ratio, but that doesn't add up unless it's scaled down.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If the F2 generation is composed of 9 birds, and the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, which is 1:3:3:1, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, if it's considering each gene separately, then perhaps the ratio is 1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait, ignoring the other. For example, checkered red would be those with C and B dominant, which is 1 bird in the 9. Checkered brown would be those with C dominant and B recessive, which is 3 birds (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb). Plain brown would be those with C recessive and B dominant, which is 3 birds (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb). Plain red would be those with both C and B recessive, which is 1 bird (cc bb). Thus, the ratio would be 1:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this exactly. Option E mentions 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, which sums to 16. Option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0, summing to 16. Option D mentions 1, 6, 2, 1, summing to 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is that each",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. However, since each gene is determined by dominance, each trait will have three phenotypes: presence of the dominant allele (for pigment and color).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to approach this by determining the possible phenotypes and then calculating the frequency based on the Punnett square.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles it receives for both genes. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pigment color (C):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (either C/C, C/c), it will display red (dominant).\n- If it has two c alleles (cc), it will display plain (recessive).\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (BB or Bb), it will display brown.\n- If it has two b alleles (bb), it will display checkered.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Red (C) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n3. Red (C) and Checkered (b): Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n5. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n6. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n7. Checkered (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nBut wait, this seems off. Because if a bird has at least one C, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B, it's brown. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene contributes the dominant allele. So the possible phenotypes are combinations where either pigment is present, or color is present, or both.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (due to C) and Brown (due to B): Checkered red\n2. Red (C) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n3. Red (C) and Checkered (b): Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n5. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n6. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n7. Checkered (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, that's seven phenotypes. Hmm, but some might overlap. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count how many of the F2 individuals exhibit each phenotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 genotypes are equally likely among the four possible genotypes (assuming independent assortment and random fertilization), each with a probability of 25%, but each genotype may correspond to different phenotypes depending on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct a Punnett square showing the possible combinations and then determine the phenotypes.\n\nBut given that the answer choices don't include 7 phenotypes, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating each trait separately, leading to four possible phenotypes instead of seven. Maybe the problem assumes that only two traits are considered, each with three phenotypes, but that doesn't make sense because each bird has two traits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats each gene separately and combines them multiplicatively, resulting in four possible phenotypic combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the number of birds exhibiting each phenotype based on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of four possible genotypes, each with a certain probability:\n\n- CC BB (Red and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb (Red and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- CC bb (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- Cc BB (Checkered and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Cc Bb (Checkered and Brown): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc BB (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc Bb (Plain and Brown): Phenotype: Plain Brown\n- cc bb (Plain and Plain): Phenotype: Plain Red\n\nWait, that's nine possibilities, but each with different phenotypes. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, let's count how many fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 4 birds (positions 2, 4, 5, 7)\n- Plain Brown: 4 birds (positions 3, 6, 8, 9)\n- Plain Red: 1 bird\n\nBut according to the options, none of them seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. Perhaps the initial assumption is that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of dominant alleles, but without considering the exact counts, perhaps the answer expects a simplified approach, such as counting the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance within each gene and consider only the presence of dominant alleles across both genes. That is, any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment or color will express the corresponding trait.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant color: Checkered Red\n2. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Checkered Brown\n3. At least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant color: Checkered Brown (same as above)\n4. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Plain Brown\n5. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Checkered Brown\n6. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Plain Brown\n7. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Checkered Brown\n8. At least one dominant pigment and at least one recessive color: Plain Brown\n9. All recessive: Plain Red\n\nThis still leads to seven phenotypes, which complicates the answer choices. Given the options provided, perhaps the intended approach is to consider each gene independently and combine their effects, leading to four phenotypic categories: Red, Brown, Checkered, and Plain. Each category corresponds to having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nUnder this interpretation, let's reevaluate:\n\n- Checkered Red: Both Pigment and Color are dominant\n- Checkered Brown: Pigment dominant, Color recessive\n- Plain Brown: Pigment recessive, Color dominant\n- Plain Red: Both Pigment and Color recessive\n\nNow, we'll calculate how many F2 birds fall into each category.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, we had:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Red: 1 bird\n\nWhich totals 1+4+4+1 = 10 birds, but this isn't directly helpful. Instead, let's look at the possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for each F2 bird, we can assess whether:\n\n- They have at least one C (for pigment) and at least one B (for color), leading to Checkered Red.\n\n- They have at least one C and at least one b (for color), leading to Checkered Brown.\n\n- They have at least one c (for pigment) and at least one B, leading to Plain Brown.\n\n- They have at least one c and at least one b, leading to Plain Red.\n\nAdditionally, if they have no dominant alleles, they'd be Plain Red.\n\nWait, but in our earlier analysis, the numbers were 1, 4, 4, 1, totaling 10. But perhaps each bird can only be one type, so the actual counts would be as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Brown: 4 birds\n- Plain Red: 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:4:4:1, which adds up to 10 birds. But looking at the answer options, none of them match this exactly. However, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option E suggests 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Again, not matching our count.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, same issue.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let's try another angle. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes, we can model the possible phenotypes as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nPhenotype 2: Either C is dominant or B is dominant, but not both \u2192 Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for pigment OR for color determines the phenotype, not both. So:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present \u2192 Phenotype is determined by the dominant allele, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more precise than that. The presence of a dominant allele in either gene results in that trait being expressed. So:\n\n- If at least one dominant C (C or C) \u2192 Pigment is brown\n- If at least one dominant B (B or b) \u2192 Color is brown\n- Otherwise, if neither is present \u2192 Both are plain\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. At least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. At least one dominant C and at least one recessive B \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. At least one recessive C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. At least one recessive C and at least one recessive B \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category.\n\nTotal F2 birds: 9 (since 3^2=9)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 This includes:\n\n   - C/B: 3 (from C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b?) Wait, no. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n   The F2 genotypes are:\n\n   - CC BB: Checkered Red\n   - CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n   - CC bb: Plain Brown\n   - Cc BB: Checkered Brown\n   - Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n   - Cc bb: Plain Brown\n   - cc BB: Plain Brown\n   - cc Bb: Plain Brown\n   - cc bb: Plain Red\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CR):\n   - Only CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n\n2. Checkered Brown (CB):\n   - CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, CC BB?\n   Wait, let's see:\n\n   - CC BB \u2192 CR\n   - CC Bb \u2192 CB\n   - CC bb \u2192 PB\n   - Cc BB \u2192 CB\n   - Cc Bb \u2192 CB\n   - Cc bb \u2192 PB\n   - cc BB \u2192 PB\n   - cc Bb \u2192 PB\n   - cc bb \u2192 PR\n\n   So CB: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\n\n3. Plain Brown (PB):\n   - CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n\n4. Plain Red (PR):\n   - Only cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3\n- PB: 3\n- PR: 1\n\nAdding up to 8 birds, missing one. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 CR\n- CC Bb \u2192 CB\n- CC bb \u2192 PB\n- Cc BB \u2192 CB\n- Cc Bb \u2192 CB\n- Cc bb \u2192 PB\n- cc BB \u2192 PB\n- cc Bb \u2192 PB\n- cc bb \u2192 PR\n\nSo indeed:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- PB: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n- PR: 1\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CR \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- PB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- PR \u2192 Plain Red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which sums to 16, which doesn't align. Option E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That sums to 16. Option D: 1, 6, 2, 1. That sums to 10. Option J: 2, 6, 3, 1. Sums to 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me double-check the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nParental cross: F1 (Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb) \u2192 F2.\n\nThe possible gametes are:\n\n- From Cc: C and c\n- From BB: B and b (but BB is homozygous, so only B)\n- From cc: c and c (only c)\n- From bb: b and b (only b)\n\nSo F2 genotypes come from combining these:\n\nPossible combinations are:\n\n1. C from Cc \u00d7 B from BB \u2192 CB\n2. C from Cc \u00d7 b from bb \u2192 Cb\n3. c from Cc \u00d7 B from BB \u2192 cB\n4. c from Cc \u00d7 b from bb \u2192 cb\n\nSince each gene is independent, each gamete is equally likely (25%), so F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- Cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CB \u2192 Checkered Brown (C is dominant, B is dominant)\n2. Cb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. cB \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. cb \u2192 Plain Brown (both recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (CB, Cb) \u2192 50%\n- Plain Brown (cB, cb) \u2192 50%\n\nNow, among the checkered phenotypes, how many have at least one dominant B?\n\n- CB: Yes (B is dominant)\n- Cb: Yes (B is dominant)\n- cB: No (B is recessive)\n- cb: No (B is recessive)\n\nSo, half of the checkered phenotype are Checkered Brown, and half are Plain Brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the checkered pigment (C is dominant), all the checkered phenotypes have C present.\n\nSo, now, focusing on the phenotypic ratios based on dominance:\n\n- Checkered Brown (from CB and Cb): These birds will have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, hence their phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n\n- Plain Brown (from cB and cb): These birds have at least one recessive C and at least one dominant B, hence their phenotype is Plain Brown.\n\nTherefore, in terms of phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 50% of the F2 population\n- Plain Brown: 50% of the F2 population\n\nWithin each group:\n\n- Among Checkered Brown, all have at least one dominant B, so their phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n\n- Among Plain Brown, all have at least one recessive C, so their phenotype is Plain Brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 (Checkered Brown : Plain Brown), but this doesn't account for dominance within the genes. However, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio based on the dominant alleles, we can say that half the F2 are Checkered Brown and half are Plain Brown, giving a ratio of 1:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly state 1:1. However, the closest option that accounts for dominance is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Which suggests a 12:2:2:0 ratio, but that doesn't add up unless it's scaled down.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If the F2 generation is composed of 9 birds, and the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, which is 1:3:3:1, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, if it's considering each gene separately, then perhaps the ratio is 1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait, ignoring the other. For example, checkered red would be those with C and B dominant, which is 1 bird in the 9. Checkered brown would be those with C dominant and B recessive, which is 3 birds (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb). Plain brown would be those with C recessive and B dominant, which is 3 birds (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb). Plain red would be those with both C and B recessive, which is 1 bird (cc bb). Thus, the ratio would be 1:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this exactly. Option E mentions 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, which sums to 16. Option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0, summing to 16. Option D mentions 1, 6, 2, 1, summing to 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is that each",

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

    "rollout": " So for pigment color, red and plain; for body color, brown and checkered. So four possible phenotypes: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H list various phenotypic ratios. Let's analyze them.\n\nOption D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to fit because for each gene, the number of phenotypes depends on the inheritance patterns. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Checkered red (both traits are checkered): This requires c (for pigment) and b (for body). The probability is (probability of c) * (probability of b).\n\nWait, no. Because each gene's expression is independent. So for each bird, the pigment and body colors are determined separately.\n\nBut let's approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the proportion of each genotype in F2.\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian pattern, so for each gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. The phenotypic ratios for each gene are:\n\n- Pigment color (C): \n  - Red (C present): 25%\n  - Plain (c present): 50% (since cc is 25%)\n  \nWait, no. Actually, the phenotypic ratio for a single gene with two alleles and dominance is:\n\n- If the bird is homozygous dominant (e.g., CC), it expresses the dominant trait.\n- If heterozygous (Cc), it also expresses the dominant trait.\n- If homozygous recessive (cc), it expresses the recessive trait.\n\nTherefore, for pigment color:\n\n- Red (dominant) = 75% (CC and Cc)\n- Plain (recessive) = 25%\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Brown (dominant) = 75%\n- Checkered (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. However, wait\u2014that's not quite right because the actual phenotypic ratios aren't multiplicative in that way. Instead, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nLet me think differently. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB): Both traits are checkered and red.\n2. Checkered brown (cB): Both traits are checkered, but brown.\n3. Plain red (cbb): Both traits are plain, but red.\n4. Plain brown (cBb): Both traits are plain, but brown.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Actually, the checkered trait is determined by the c (for pigment) and b (for body) alleles. Similarly, red is determined by C (pigment) and c (body). So the four phenotypes correspond to all possible combinations of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment red, body checkered: (C, B) \u2192 red, checkered\n- Pigment red, body brown: (C, B) \u2192 red, brown\n- Pigment plain, body checkered: (c, b) \u2192 plain, checkered\n- Pigment plain, body brown: (c, b) \u2192 plain, brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it's not that straightforward. Each gene acts independently. So the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Pigmented red and checkered: (C, B)\n- Pigmented red and brown: (C, B)\n- Pigmented plain and checkered: (c, b)\n- Pigmented plain and brown: (c, b)\n\nBut actually, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red checkered (C and b)\n2. Red brown (C and B)\n3. Plain checkered (c and b)\n4. Plain brown (c and B)\n\nSo now, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nEach gene (C and B) segregates independently. So for each gene, the segregation pattern is:\n\n- For C:\n  - Dominant (C) occurs 3/4 of the time (CC, Cc)\n  - Recessive (c) occurs 1/4 of the time (cc)\n  \n- For B:\n  - Dominant (B) occurs 3/4 of the time (BB, Bb)\n  - Recessive (b) occurs 1/4 of the time (bb)\n\nThe combined phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene, but since each bird has both traits, the overall ratio isn't simply 3/4 x 3/4 = 9/16. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, so the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB): (cc)(bb) \u2192 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16\n2. Checkered brown (cB): (cc)(BB/Bb) \u2192 1/4 x 3/4 = 3/16\n3. Plain red (cb): (cc)(bb) \u2192 same as above, 1/16\n4. Plain brown (cb): (cc)(BB/Bb) \u2192 3/16\n\nAdding these up: 1+3+1+3=8 parts out of 16. So the phenotypic ratio is 8:8, which simplifies to 1:1 for each pair of phenotypes. Wait, that doesn't seem right because some phenotypes overlap in terms of dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, the four phenotypes can be categorized as:\n\n- Red (C present): combines red checkered (cB) and red brown (cB)\n- Plain (c present): combines plain checkered (cb) and plain brown (cb)\n  \nSo within the red category, the phenotypes are red checkered and red brown, each occurring with different probabilities.\n\nSimilarly, within the plain category, the phenotypes are plain checkered and plain brown.\n\nGiven that, the overall counts would be:\n\n- Red checkered: 1/16 of the population (1 part)\n- Red brown: 3/16 (3 parts)\n- Plain checkered: 1/16 (1 part)\n- Plain brown: 3/16 (3 parts)\n\nTotaling 8 parts out of 16, so the ratio is 8:8, or simplified to 1:1 for each category.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that totals 16 parts, which fits our calculation. Option D matches this breakdown.\n\nWait, but hold on. According to my previous analysis, the count for each phenotype is 1, 3, 1, 3, totaling 8, which is half of the population. So option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify once more. The F2 generation is a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous for both genes. Therefore, the expected genotypes in F2 are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWhen these self-fertilize, the F2 generation will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThen, when determining phenotypes based on the dominance rules, each genotype translates to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (both c and b)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain red (c present, b absent)\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown (c present, b absent)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: (CC BB) + (CC bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain red: (cc BB) + (cc bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: (CC bb) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: (cc bb) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Oh, I see\u2014I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this correctly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's genotype can lead to a specific phenotype based on dominance. Let's categorize each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant alleles present: Checkered red\n2. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive: Plain red\n3. cc BB \u2192 c dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 c and B recessive: Plain brown\n\nNow, how many of each genotype are present in the F2?\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nSo:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Plain red\n- cc BB: Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 25% : 25% : 25% : 25%\n\nWhich simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest is option D, which lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums to 16 parts, which is the entire population. So option D must be correct because it accounts for the correct proportions after considering the dominance rules.\n\nWait, but according to the correct analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but option D reflects the counts based on dominance, grouping the recessive alleles together. So perhaps the correct answer is D because it groups the recessive alleles together, leading to four phenotypes with specific counts based on dominance.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you look at the phenotypes, the recessive alleles (c and b) combine to produce a certain phenotype, while the dominant alleles (C and B) produce another. So the phenotypes are grouped based on whether the dominant or recessive alleles are present.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color, red and plain; for body color, brown and checkered. So four possible phenotypes: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H list various phenotypic ratios. Let's analyze them.\n\nOption D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to fit because for each gene, the number of phenotypes depends on the inheritance patterns. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Checkered red (both traits are checkered): This requires c (for pigment) and b (for body). The probability is (probability of c) * (probability of b).\n\nWait, no. Because each gene's expression is independent. So for each bird, the pigment and body colors are determined separately.\n\nBut let's approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the proportion of each genotype in F2.\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian pattern, so for each gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. The phenotypic ratios for each gene are:\n\n- Pigment color (C): \n  - Red (C present): 25%\n  - Plain (c present): 50% (since cc is 25%)\n  \nWait, no. Actually, the phenotypic ratio for a single gene with two alleles and dominance is:\n\n- If the bird is homozygous dominant (e.g., CC), it expresses the dominant trait.\n- If heterozygous (Cc), it also expresses the dominant trait.\n- If homozygous recessive (cc), it expresses the recessive trait.\n\nTherefore, for pigment color:\n\n- Red (dominant) = 75% (CC and Cc)\n- Plain (recessive) = 25%\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Brown (dominant) = 75%\n- Checkered (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. However, wait\u2014that's not quite right because the actual phenotypic ratios aren't multiplicative in that way. Instead, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently.\n\nLet me think differently. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB): Both traits are checkered and red.\n2. Checkered brown (cB): Both traits are checkered, but brown.\n3. Plain red (cbb): Both traits are plain, but red.\n4. Plain brown (cBb): Both traits are plain, but brown.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Actually, the checkered trait is determined by the c (for pigment) and b (for body) alleles. Similarly, red is determined by C (pigment) and c (body). So the four phenotypes correspond to all possible combinations of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment red, body checkered: (C, B) \u2192 red, checkered\n- Pigment red, body brown: (C, B) \u2192 red, brown\n- Pigment plain, body checkered: (c, b) \u2192 plain, checkered\n- Pigment plain, body brown: (c, b) \u2192 plain, brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it's not that straightforward. Each gene acts independently. So the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Pigmented red and checkered: (C, B)\n- Pigmented red and brown: (C, B)\n- Pigmented plain and checkered: (c, b)\n- Pigmented plain and brown: (c, b)\n\nBut actually, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red checkered (C and b)\n2. Red brown (C and B)\n3. Plain checkered (c and b)\n4. Plain brown (c and B)\n\nSo now, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nEach gene (C and B) segregates independently. So for each gene, the segregation pattern is:\n\n- For C:\n  - Dominant (C) occurs 3/4 of the time (CC, Cc)\n  - Recessive (c) occurs 1/4 of the time (cc)\n  \n- For B:\n  - Dominant (B) occurs 3/4 of the time (BB, Bb)\n  - Recessive (b) occurs 1/4 of the time (bb)\n\nThe combined phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene, but since each bird has both traits, the overall ratio isn't simply 3/4 x 3/4 = 9/16. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, so the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cB): (cc)(bb) \u2192 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16\n2. Checkered brown (cB): (cc)(BB/Bb) \u2192 1/4 x 3/4 = 3/16\n3. Plain red (cb): (cc)(bb) \u2192 same as above, 1/16\n4. Plain brown (cb): (cc)(BB/Bb) \u2192 3/16\n\nAdding these up: 1+3+1+3=8 parts out of 16. So the phenotypic ratio is 8:8, which simplifies to 1:1 for each pair of phenotypes. Wait, that doesn't seem right because some phenotypes overlap in terms of dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, the four phenotypes can be categorized as:\n\n- Red (C present): combines red checkered (cB) and red brown (cB)\n- Plain (c present): combines plain checkered (cb) and plain brown (cb)\n  \nSo within the red category, the phenotypes are red checkered and red brown, each occurring with different probabilities.\n\nSimilarly, within the plain category, the phenotypes are plain checkered and plain brown.\n\nGiven that, the overall counts would be:\n\n- Red checkered: 1/16 of the population (1 part)\n- Red brown: 3/16 (3 parts)\n- Plain checkered: 1/16 (1 part)\n- Plain brown: 3/16 (3 parts)\n\nTotaling 8 parts out of 16, so the ratio is 8:8, or simplified to 1:1 for each category.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that totals 16 parts, which fits our calculation. Option D matches this breakdown.\n\nWait, but hold on. According to my previous analysis, the count for each phenotype is 1, 3, 1, 3, totaling 8, which is half of the population. So option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify once more. The F2 generation is a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous for both genes. Therefore, the expected genotypes in F2 are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWhen these self-fertilize, the F2 generation will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThen, when determining phenotypes based on the dominance rules, each genotype translates to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (both c and b)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain red (c present, b absent)\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown (c present, b absent)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: (CC BB) + (CC bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain red: (cc BB) + (cc bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: (CC bb) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: (cc bb) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Oh, I see\u2014I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this correctly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's genotype can lead to a specific phenotype based on dominance. Let's categorize each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant alleles present: Checkered red\n2. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive: Plain red\n3. cc BB \u2192 c dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 c and B recessive: Plain brown\n\nNow, how many of each genotype are present in the F2?\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nSo:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Plain red\n- cc BB: Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 25% : 25% : 25% : 25%\n\nWhich simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest is option D, which lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums to 16 parts, which is the entire population. So option D must be correct because it accounts for the correct proportions after considering the dominance rules.\n\nWait, but according to the correct analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but option D reflects the counts based on dominance, grouping the recessive alleles together. So perhaps the correct answer is D because it groups the recessive alleles together, leading to four phenotypes with specific counts based on dominance.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you look at the phenotypes, the recessive alleles (c and b) combine to produce a certain phenotype, while the dominant alleles (C and B) produce another. So the phenotypes are grouped based on whether the dominant or recessive alleles are present.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " However, the question refers to \"phenotypic ratio\" for the F2, so perhaps it's considering the combined effect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The F2 would have four possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut since some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype due to dominance relationships, the actual phenotypic classes might reduce the number of categories. Alternatively, each phenotype could correspond to certain genotypic combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the phenotypes directly without aggregating into classes, focusing on the counts of each specific phenotype. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nEach bird is determined by two genes, C and B. Let's consider the possible phenotypes based on the alleles:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Checkered Red\n2. C_ and bb: Checkered Brown\n3. cc and B_: Plain Red\n4. cc and bb: Plain Brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have these four phenotypes. To determine the count, we'll look at the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), their F1 is CcBb, which then selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (since C_ and B_)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (since C_ and bb)\n- cc: Plain Red (since cc and B_)\n- bb: Plain Brown (since cc and bb)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution among the F2 population is:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't make sense because F2 should have 100%. This suggests I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh! Wait a minute. Perhaps the question isn't asking for the F2 generation, but the F1 and F2 ratios in terms of phenotypic categories, including dominance. Maybe the question is asking for the ratio of checkered red to plain red, etc., instead of the overall F2 distribution.\n\nLet me clarify: If the question asks for the ratio of checkered red to plain red, checkered brown to plain brown, etc., then based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red (C_ and B_): 25% (from CC and Cc)\n- Plain Red (cc and B_): 25% (from cc and Cc)\nWait no, the C_ comes from either C_ (which includes Cc and CC) and B_ (which includes B_ and bb).\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_ (either CC or Cc) and B_ (either B_ or bb). So the proportion is (probability of C_) * (probability of B_) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Checkered Brown: C_ and bb. Probability of C_ is 2/3, probability of bb is 1/3. So 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain Red: cc and B_. Probability of cc is 1/3, probability of B_ is 2/3. So 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain Brown: cc and bb. Probability of cc is 1/3, probability of bb is 1/3. So 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nIf the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 of these phenotypes, then:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown =\n\n(2/3 * 2/3) : (2/3 * 1/3) : (1/3 * 2/3) : (1/3 * 1/3) = (4/9) : (2/9) : (2/9) : (1/9)\n\nTo simplify, multiply all by 9: 4 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nTotal parts: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12+2+2+0=16\u22609\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\u22609\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12\u22609\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\u22609\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\u22609\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4+4+4+4=16\u22609\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16\u22609\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9+3+3+1=16\u22609\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16\u22609\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\u22609\nHmm, none of the options sum to 9. That suggests I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2. Let me see.\n\nThe question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, that sounds like F1 generation, not F2. Because adi hybrid crosses usually refer to F1. Let me double-check the question.\n\nThe original question was: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Adi hybrid crosses typically involve two loci and two alleles each, often resulting in F1. However, sometimes it can also refer to F2. But in this context, the problem states \"adihybridcross,\" which is ambiguous. Given that the answer choices don't align with any of the sums being 16, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the F2 ratios regardless of the options.\n\nGiven that, and knowing the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, but the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 ratio in terms of phenotypes. The F1 is CcBb, so what's the phenotypic breakdown?\n\nIn F1, each bird is C_ (since C is dominant) and B_ (since B is dominant), so all are Checkered Red. So F1 would have 100% checkered red, with no variation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 16\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 16\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 16\nNone of these add up to 100%. So perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, another possibility: The question might be referring to the ratio of checkered red to plain red, etc., rather than the entire F2. As previously, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match that. However, Option D is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to a ratio where checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 9 parts, and plain brown is 3 parts. Adding those together gives 16, which doesn't fit the F2 scenario. But perhaps the question is asking for something else.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup: The parents are CCBB (homozygous dominant) and ccbb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb (as both parents can only contribute CB and cb). The F1 would then self to produce F2. The F2 would have four possible genotypes, each leading to a specific phenotype.

In that case, F1 is all Checkered Red, so the ratio would be 100%, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 phenotypic ratio, and the closest option is D, which is 1:3:9:3, but scaled to percentages. However, scaling that to percentages would mean checkered red is 1/16, which is 6.25%, but the actual F2 is 25% for each phenotype, so that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 ratio as 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match that. Hmm, I must be missing something. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total parts. But according to our earlier calculation, F2 should be 4:2:2:1, adding to 9. So perhaps the question is asking for the F1 ratio, which is 100%, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 phenotypic ratio expressed differently.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the question is considering the F2 ratio relative to the F1, but that wouldn't make much sense.

Actually, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB x CB = CcBb (25%)\n- CB x cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb x CB = CcBb (25%)\n- cb x cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. The correct way is:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete: 50% CB and 50% cb.\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB x CB = CcBb (25%)\n- CB x cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb x CB = CcBb (25%)\n- cb x cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nSo all F2 genotypes are CcBb and ccbb, each at 25%.\n\nTranslating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered Red (100%)\n- ccbb: Plain Brown (100%)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1, but none of the options reflect that.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. However, the question refers to \"phenotypic ratio\" for the F2, so perhaps it's considering the combined effect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The F2 would have four possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut since some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype due to dominance relationships, the actual phenotypic classes might reduce the number of categories. Alternatively, each phenotype could correspond to certain genotypic combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the phenotypes directly without aggregating into classes, focusing on the counts of each specific phenotype. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nEach bird is determined by two genes, C and B. Let's consider the possible phenotypes based on the alleles:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Checkered Red\n2. C_ and bb: Checkered Brown\n3. cc and B_: Plain Red\n4. cc and bb: Plain Brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have these four phenotypes. To determine the count, we'll look at the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), their F1 is CcBb, which then selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (since C_ and B_)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (since C_ and bb)\n- cc: Plain Red (since cc and B_)\n- bb: Plain Brown (since cc and bb)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution among the F2 population is:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't make sense because F2 should have 100%. This suggests I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh! Wait a minute. Perhaps the question isn't asking for the F2 generation, but the F1 and F2 ratios in terms of phenotypic categories, including dominance. Maybe the question is asking for the ratio of checkered red to plain red, etc., instead of the overall F2 distribution.\n\nLet me clarify: If the question asks for the ratio of checkered red to plain red, checkered brown to plain brown, etc., then based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red (C_ and B_): 25% (from CC and Cc)\n- Plain Red (cc and B_): 25% (from cc and Cc)\nWait no, the C_ comes from either C_ (which includes Cc and CC) and B_ (which includes B_ and bb).\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_ (either CC or Cc) and B_ (either B_ or bb). So the proportion is (probability of C_) * (probability of B_) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Checkered Brown: C_ and bb. Probability of C_ is 2/3, probability of bb is 1/3. So 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain Red: cc and B_. Probability of cc is 1/3, probability of B_ is 2/3. So 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain Brown: cc and bb. Probability of cc is 1/3, probability of bb is 1/3. So 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nIf the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 of these phenotypes, then:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown =\n\n(2/3 * 2/3) : (2/3 * 1/3) : (1/3 * 2/3) : (1/3 * 1/3) = (4/9) : (2/9) : (2/9) : (1/9)\n\nTo simplify, multiply all by 9: 4 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nTotal parts: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12+2+2+0=16\u22609\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\u22609\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12\u22609\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\u22609\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\u22609\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4+4+4+4=16\u22609\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16\u22609\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9+3+3+1=16\u22609\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16\u22609\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\u22609\nHmm, none of the options sum to 9. That suggests I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2. Let me see.\n\nThe question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, that sounds like F1 generation, not F2. Because adi hybrid crosses usually refer to F1. Let me double-check the question.\n\nThe original question was: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Adi hybrid crosses typically involve two loci and two alleles each, often resulting in F1. However, sometimes it can also refer to F2. But in this context, the problem states \"adihybridcross,\" which is ambiguous. Given that the answer choices don't align with any of the sums being 16, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the F2 ratios regardless of the options.\n\nGiven that, and knowing the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, but the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 ratio in terms of phenotypes. The F1 is CcBb, so what's the phenotypic breakdown?\n\nIn F1, each bird is C_ (since C is dominant) and B_ (since B is dominant), so all are Checkered Red. So F1 would have 100% checkered red, with no variation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 16\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 16\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 16\nNone of these add up to 100%. So perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, another possibility: The question might be referring to the ratio of checkered red to plain red, etc., rather than the entire F2. As previously, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match that. However, Option D is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to a ratio where checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 9 parts, and plain brown is 3 parts. Adding those together gives 16, which doesn't fit the F2 scenario. But perhaps the question is asking for something else.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup: The parents are CCBB (homozygous dominant) and ccbb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb (as both parents can only contribute CB and cb). The F1 would then self to produce F2. The F2 would have four possible genotypes, each leading to a specific phenotype. The phenotypic ratio of F2 would be 4:2:2:1, but the options don't reflect that.

In that case, F1 is all Checkered Red, so the ratio would be 100%, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 phenotypic ratio, and the closest option is D, which is 1:3:9:3, but scaled to percentages. However, scaling that to percentages would mean checkered red is 1/16, which is 6.25%, but the actual F2 is 25% for each phenotype, so that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 ratio as 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match that. Hmm, I must be missing something. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total parts.

The correct way is:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete: 50% CB and 50% cb.\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB x CB = CcBb (25%)\n- CB x cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb x CB = CcBb (25%)\n- cb x cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nSo all F2 genotypes are CcBb and ccbb, each at 25%.\n\nTranslating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered Red (100%)\n- ccbb: Plain Brown (100%)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1, but none of the options reflect that. However, if the options are considering F2 relative to the F1, which is 100%, then each phenotype would be 50% of the F2, making the ratio 1:1. Still not matching.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the F1 ratio, which is 100% Checkered Red, but that's not an option either.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer is D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the correct answer isn't listed. However, since I have to choose, I'll go with Option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "rollout": " However, the way the problem describes, each bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles at both loci. The problem states that \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Similarly, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe genes are:\n\n- C (dominant = red, recessive = plain)\n\n- B (dominant = brown, recessive = checkered)\n\nSo each bird has two traits: pigment color (C or c) and body color (B or b).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the checkered pattern is due to C, and plain color is due to c. Pigment color is due to B, and brown due to b.\n\nTherefore, each bird has a phenotype determined by both C and B. The possible phenotypes are combinations of these. However, without dominance, some combinations might not be observed. But given that C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, every bird will exhibit at least one dominant trait. Specifically, any bird with either C or B will display at least one dominant trait, except if both are recessive, which isn't possible here because C and B are independent. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both c and b, then it would display both traits as recessive, i.e., checkered and plain, respectively. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and plain (cc bb)\n\n- Checkered and brown (cc bb?)\n\nWait, no, wait: For pigment color (C):\n\n- C: red (dominant)\n\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B: brown (dominant)\n\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): red-brown\n\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): red-checkered\n\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): plain-brown\n\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nHowever, since C is dominant, a bird with c will always express red. Similarly, since B is dominant, a bird with b will always express brown. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown\n\n- Red-checkered\n\n- Plain-brown\n\n- Plain-checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing. The F1 was CcBb. When selfed, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- CC BB (all dominant)\n\n- CC Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n\n- CC bb (C dominant, b recessive)\n\n- Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n\n- Cc Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n\n- Cc bb (C dominant, b recessive)\n\n- cc BB (c recessive, B dominant)\n\n- cc Bb (c recessive, B recessive)\n\n- cc bb (both recessive)\n\nBut considering dominance, let's see what phenotypes these would display:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether C is present (red) or not, and B is present (brown) or not. Since both genes are acting independently, each bird's phenotype can be categorized into four possible phenotypic categories based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. Both C and B present: red-brown\n\n2. C present, B absent: red-checkered\n\n3. C absent, B present: plain-brown\n\n4. Both C and B absent: plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype in F2 can be calculated by determining the probability of each genotype leading to that phenotype.\n\nSince each parent is CcBb, and assuming independent assortment, the F2 will have the following distribution:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of CC: 25%\n\n- Probability of Cc: 50%\n\n- Probability of cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of BB: 25%\n\n- Probability of Bb: 50%\n\n- Probability of bb: 25%\n\nNow, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are found by multiplying the probabilities of each gene.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: red-brown\n\nThis happens when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes. The probability is 1 minus the probability of having neither dominant allele.\n\nProbability of C being recessive (cc): 25%\nProbability of B being recessive (bb): 25%\nAssuming independence, the probability of neither is 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nThus, probability of red-brown = 1 - 6.25% = 93.75%\n\n2. C present, B absent (red-checkered)\n\nThis requires C to be present (so not cc) and B to be recessive (not BB or Bb). Wait, no: B is recessive (b) for checkered, but if B is present, it's brown. So for B absent, the bird must have bb.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nP(C is not cc) * P(B is bb)\n\nWhich is:\n\n(1 - 25%) * (25%) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%\n\n3. C absent, B present (plain-brown)\n\nThis requires c (for C) and B present (so not bb). So:\n\nP(C is cc) * P(B is not bb)\n\nWhich is:\n\n25% * (1 - 25%) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75%\n\n4. Both C and B absent (plain-checkered)\n\nBoth c and b are present:\n\nP(C is cc) * P(B is bb) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo the four phenotypic ratios are approximately:\n\n- red-brown : 93.75%\n\n- red-checkered : 18.75%\n\n- plain-brown : 18.75%\n\n- plain-checkered : 6.25%\n\nTo convert these into whole numbers, we can assume a large number of birds, say 16 (to make denominators divide evenly):\n\n- red-brown: 15\n\n- red-checkered: 3\n\n- plain-brown: 3\n\n- plain-checkered: 1\n\nAdding them up: 15+3+3+1=22, which seems off because I thought the total would be 16. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the ratios should sum to 100%, so let's adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the actual probabilities are fractions:\n\n- red-brown: 9/16\n\n- red-checkered: 3/16\n\n- plain-brown: 3/16\n\n- plain-checkered: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each bird is produced by independent assortment, the probabilities for each trait are independent. Let's compute the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus. In F2:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (i.e., C present) is 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc).\n- Probability of having recessive (C present) is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (B present) is 3/4.\n- Probability of being recessive (B present) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability of C present: 3/4\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb):\n   - C present: 3/4\n   - B absent: 1/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_):\n   - C absent: 1/4\n   - B present: 3/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb):\n   - C absent: 1/4\n   - B absent: 1/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 16/16=1. So the probabilities are 9/16 for Red Brown, 3/16 for Red Checkered, 3/16 for Plain Brown, and 1/16 for Plain Checkered.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the four phenotypes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So each bird can be categorized into four phenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that depends on whether the dominance applies across both genes. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by gene C (C dominant = red, c = plain). Body color is determined by gene B (B dominant = brown, b = checkered). Both genes are acting independently. So a bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of its pigment and body colors.\n\nSo possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each bird is produced by independent assortment, the probabilities for each trait are independent. Let's compute the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus. In F2:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (i.e., C present) is 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc).\n- Probability of having recessive (C present) is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant allele (B present) is 3/4.\n- Probability of being recessive (B present) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability of C present: 3/4\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb):\n   - C present: 3/4\n   - B absent: 1/4\n   - Combined: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_):\n   - C absent: 1/4\n   - B present: 3/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb):\n   - C absent: 1/4\n   - B absent: 1/4\n   - Combined: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 16/16=1. So the probabilities are 9/16 for Red Brown, 3/16 for Red Checkered, 3/16 for Plain Brown, and 1/16 for Plain Checkered.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the four phenotypes. So the order of the phenotypes in terms of occurrence would be:\n\n- Red Brown\n- Red Checkered\n- Plain Brown\n- Plain Checkered\n\nBut depending on how the options are presented, it could vary. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This doesn't match our calculation. Our calculation shows Red Brown (9), Red Checkered (3), Plain Brown (3), Plain Checkered (1).\n\nLooking through the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Yes, this matches our calculation exactly.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Alternatively, considering each gene separately:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these. Now, considering the F2 generation, each bird has two copies of each gene. The F2 will have genotypes that determine the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. Checkered red: Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (B)\n   - Probability of pigment plain: 25%\n   - Probability of body brown: 25%\n   - Since they are independent, multiply: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n2. Checkered brown: Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b)\n   - 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n3. Plain red: Pigment red (C) and Body plain (b)\n   - 25% (for C) * 75% (for b) = 18.75%\n\n4. Plain brown: Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B)\n   - 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 6.25 + 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 37.5%, which doesn't make sense because probabilities should add up to 100%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n\n- C (red) \u2192 Pigment red\n- c \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n\n- B \u2192 Brown\n- b \u2192 Checkered\n\nThe combined phenotype depends on whether either or both genes are present. Let's consider each possible genotype:\n\nPossible genotypes for each bird (since F2 is from a dihybrid cross, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so four possible combinations, but for the purpose of phenotype, we'll consider the presence or absence of each dominant allele).\n\nAlternatively, the number of phenotypic classes can be determined by counting the possible combinations. Since each gene has two possible outcomes, the total number of phenotypic classes is 2x2=4, but some classes may overlap depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but in this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So, the order matters. Let me map the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these is distinct because the presence of either dominant allele leads to different phenotypes. Now, let's compute the probability for each:\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n- Probability = 25% (C) + 50% (Cc) + 75% (CC) = 100%? Wait, no, in terms of presence of dominant allele, Pigment red is when at least one C is present. So Pigment red (C) includes CC, Cc, and C/Cc? Wait, no, in terms of presence, Pigment red is any bird with at least one C allele. Similarly, Pigment plain (c) is any bird with at least one c.\n\nSimilarly for the body color.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (B))\n   - Pigment plain: 25%\n   - Body brown: 25%\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n2. Checkered brown (Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b))\n   - Pigment plain: 25%\n   - Body checkered: 75%\n   - Combined: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n3. Plain red (Pigment red (C) and Body plain (b))\n   - Pigment red: 75%\n   - Body plain: 25%\n   - Combined: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n4. Plain brown (Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B))\n   - Pigment red: 75%\n   - Body brown: 75%\n   - Combined: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nNow, summing these up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 56.25%\n\nExpressed as whole numbers, we can approximate:\n\n- Checkered red: ~6.25 \u2248 6\n- Checkered brown: ~18.75 \u2248 19\n- Plain red: ~18.75 \u2248 19\n- Plain brown: ~56.25 \u2248 56\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems way off compared to our calculations. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which also doesn't fit. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, not 16. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. None seem to align perfectly. Maybe the options are approximations or miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes was incorrect. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the parent 1 is CC BB, which indeed can only give CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, giving cb gametes. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. So the F2 genotypes are correct. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes as calculated earlier should hold. None of the answer choices exactly match my calculation, but looking at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing those gives 12, which is less than 16. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This sums to 16, but the actual ratios are 6.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, 56.25%. So option E is close but not matching the exact percentages. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to use a Punnett square where the F2 is considered without considering the exact probabilities due to rounding, leading to option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that totals 16 as well, but the actual counts would reflect the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to round the probabilities differently. Another possibility is that the user forgot to apply the correct dominance hierarchy. Wait, in this case, the dominance is clear: C > c and B > b. So the calculations remain accurate. Given that, none of the options perfectly match, but option D suggests a different distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, like assuming independent assortment without considering dominance, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the presence of at least one dominant allele, but that still holds. I'm a bit stuck, but given the options, option D seems to have the highest plain brown (3), which matches our calculation of 56.25% approximately as 3 when rounded. However, the other numbers don't quite align. Alternatively, perhaps the question used a different method, such as considering the number of dominant vs recessive alleles, leading to different ratios. For example, for each trait, the number of dominant alleles over recessive. For pigment color (C/B), dominant alleles are C and B, while recessive are c and b. For the F2 generation, each bird has two alleles for each gene. For pigment color, the possible phenotypes are Pigmented (any dominant C) and Plain (recessive c). Similarly for body color. Using this approach, the ratios could be calculated based on the number of dominant alleles. For example, for pigment color: each bird contributes two alleles. The probability of having at least one dominant C is 3/4. Similarly for B. But since the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype would be the product of the individual probabilities. Thus, for Checkered red (c and b), the probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. For Checkered brown (c and B), it's (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. For Plain red (C and b), it's (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. For Plain brown (C and B), it's (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Adding these up: 1+3+3+9=16 parts. So the ratios are 1:3:3:9. Translating to counts, assuming 16 birds: 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 9 Plain brown. Which corresponds to option J, but J says checkered red 2, etc., which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the user rounded to the nearest whole number, making it 1, 3, 3, 9, which is option J. However, the options don't include J directly; the closest is option J, but J says 2, 6, 3, 1, which sums to 12, not 16. Therefore, the most accurate option is option D, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the exact percentages, whereas option J sums to 16 but has rounded numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach without considering dominance, leading to option D's ratios. However, I'm confident in my calculations, so perhaps the correct answer is option D, even though it's approximate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): plain brown\n\nWait, but this might not account for all possible combinations. Alternatively, considering each gene separately:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these. Now, considering the F2 generation, each bird has two copies of each gene. The F2 will have genotypes that determine the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. Checkered red: Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (B)\n   - Probability of pigment plain: 25%\n   - Probability of body brown: 25%\n   - Since they are independent, multiply: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n2. Checkered brown: Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b)\n   - 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n3. Plain red: Pigment red (C) and Body plain (b)\n   - 25% (for C) * 75% (for b) = 18.75%\n\n4. Plain brown: Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B)\n   - 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 6.25 + 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 37.5%, which doesn't make sense because probabilities should add up to 100%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n\n- C (red) \u2192 Pigment red\n- c \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n\n- B \u2192 Brown\n- b \u2192 Checkered\n\nThe combined phenotype depends on whether either or both genes are present. Let's consider each possible genotype:\n\nPossible genotypes for each bird (since F2 is from a dihybrid cross, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so four possible combinations, but for the purpose of phenotype, we'll consider the presence or absence of each dominant allele).\n\nAlternatively, the number of phenotypic classes can be determined by counting the possible combinations. Since each gene has two possible outcomes, the total number of phenotypic classes is 2x2=4, but some classes may overlap depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but in this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So, the order matters. Let me map the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these is distinct because the presence of either dominant allele leads to different phenotypes. Now, let's compute the probability for each:\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n- Probability = 25% (C) + 50% (Cc) + 75% (CC) = 100%? Wait, no, in terms of presence of dominant allele, Pigment red is when at least one C is present. So Pigment red (C) includes CC, Cc, and C/Cc? Wait, no, in terms of presence, Pigment red is any bird with at least one C allele. Similarly, Pigment plain (c) is any bird with at least one c.\n\nSimilarly for the body color.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (B))\n   - Pigment plain: 25%\n   - Body brown: 25%\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n2. Checkered brown (Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b))\n   - Pigment plain: 25%\n   - Body checkered: 75%\n   - Combined: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n3. Plain red (Pigment red (C) and Body plain (b))\n   - Pigment red: 75%\n   - Body plain: 25%\n   - Combined: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n4. Plain brown (Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B))\n   - Pigment red: 75%\n   - Body brown: 75%\n   - Combined: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nNow, summing these up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 56.25%\n\nExpressed as whole numbers, we can approximate:\n\n- Checkered red: ~6.25 \u2248 6\n- Checkered brown: ~18.75 \u2248 19\n- Plain red: ~18.75 \u2248 19\n- Plain brown: ~56.25 \u2248 56\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems way off compared to our calculations. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which also doesn't fit. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, not 16. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. None seem to align perfectly. Maybe the options are approximations or miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes was incorrect. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the parent 1 is CC BB, which indeed can only give CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, giving cb gametes. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. So the F2 genotypes are correct. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes as calculated earlier should hold. None of the answer choices exactly match my calculation, but looking at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing those gives 12, which is less than 16. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This sums to 16, but the actual ratios are 6.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, 56.25%. So option E is close but not matching the exact percentages. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to use a Punnett square where the F2 is considered without considering the exact probabilities due to rounding, leading to option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that totals 16 as well, but the actual counts would reflect the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to round the probabilities differently. Another possibility is that the user forgot to apply the correct dominance hierarchy. Wait, in this case, the dominance is clear: C > c and B > b. So the calculations remain accurate. Given that, none of the options perfectly match, but option D suggests a different distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, like assuming independent assortment without considering dominance, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the presence of at least one dominant allele, but that still holds. I'm a bit stuck, but given the options, option D seems to have the highest plain brown (3), which matches our calculation of 56.25% approximately as 3 when rounded. However, the other numbers don't quite align. Alternatively, perhaps the question used a different method, such as considering the number of dominant vs recessive alleles, leading to different ratios. For example, for each trait, the number of dominant alleles over recessive. For pigment color (C/B), dominant alleles are C and B, while recessive are c and b. For the F2 generation, each bird has two alleles for each gene. For pigment color, the possible phenotypes are Pigmented (any dominant C) and Plain (recessive c). Similarly for body color. Using this approach, the ratios could be calculated based on the number of dominant alleles. For example, for pigment color: each bird contributes two alleles. The probability of having at least one dominant C is 3/4. Similarly for B. But since the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype would be the product of the individual probabilities. Thus, for Checkered red (c and b), the probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. For Checkered brown (c and B), it's (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. For Plain red (C and b), it's (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. For Plain brown (C and B), it's (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Adding these up: 1+3+3+9=16 parts. So the ratios are 1:3:3:9. Translating to counts, assuming 16 birds: 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 9 Plain brown. Which corresponds to option J, but J says checkered red 2, etc., which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the user rounded to the nearest whole number, making it 1, 3, 3, 9, which is option J. However, the options don't include J directly; the closest is option J, but J says 2, 6, 3, 1, which sums to 12, not 16. Therefore, the most accurate option is option D, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the exact percentages, whereas option J sums to 16 but has rounded numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach without considering dominance, leading to option D's ratios. However, I'm confident in my calculations, so perhaps the correct answer is option D, even though it's approximate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Each gene has a 50% chance of being present (since both alleles are dominant or recessive respectively). So for pigment (C):\n\n- Presence (Red): 50%\n- Absence (Plain): 50%\n\nSimilarly, for body (B):\n\n- Presence (Brown): 50%\n- Absence (Checkered): 50%\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.

However, in this case, since each gene is fully expressed (both dominant alleles present lead to the same phenotype), we don't have overlapping phenotypes. So each combination leads to a unique phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered Red, 25% Plain Red, 25% Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Brown. That adds up to 100%, as expected.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum is 16, but each number seems high. Option G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Also sum to 18. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the parents.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (which is the same as C c c c?) Wait no, wait. Hold on! The initial statement was that the bird is a homozygous checkered red bird. Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So CC is homozygous dominant. Similarly, the other parent is a plain brown bird, which is homozygous recessive: cc and bb. Wait, no: \"a plain brown bird\" implies that the bird is homozygous recessive for both genes. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would yield the F2 generation. So each gene is independently assorting. So for the C locus: presence (red) is dominant over absence (plain). For B locus: presence (brown) is dominant over absence (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are as I thought before, with 25% each for the four phenotypes. So looking at the options:\n\nWhich option matches 25% each? None do exactly. Wait, let me see the options again:\n\nOptions are given as A through J, each with specific counts. Let me look at option H: phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculation, it should be 4 phenotypes each at 25%, i.e., 4 each contributing 4, totaling 16. Wait, no, that's not right. If each phenotype is 25%, then each category would have 4 out of 16. So each phenotype should occur 4 times. So none of the options seem to match 4 each. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no, because each gene has two possibilities, leading to four phenotypic categories. Each category would have 4 instances (since 16 total, divided equally into 4). So each phenotype should occur 4 times. Looking at the options:\n\nNone of the options match that exactly. Let me check each option:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16. But each phenotype shouldn't be 4. Similarly, option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents. Wait, the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. That would mean it's heterozygous? No, homozygous means both alleles are the same. So CC is homozygous dominant. Similarly, the other parent is homozygous recessive for both genes, so cc and bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that makes sense. So the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would lead to F2 with 25% for each of the four phenotypes.\n\nBut the options don't have such a distribution. Maybe the problem considers that each trait is expressed independently, leading to different ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the options, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait another approach: Let's calculate the actual number of each phenotype in F2. F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but due to dominance, some may collapse. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered bird is when both genes are recessive. So in the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C dominant (red): presence of C in F2.\n2. Both B dominant (brown): presence of B in F2.\n3. Both recessive (c and b): checkered.\n4. One dominant and one recessive: depends on which gene.\n\nWait, but how does the dominance affect the phenotypes? Let me think again. For pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red, regardless of the body color. Similarly, for body color, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered Red | Yes | No\nCheckered Brown | No | Yes\nPlain Red | Yes | No\nPlain Brown | No | No\n\nEach of these four possibilities exists in the F2 population. Now, let's calculate the proportion of each.\n\nGiven that each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities are:\n\n- Presence of C: 50% (since both alleles are dominant)\n- Absence of C: 50% (both recessive)\n- Presence of B: 50% (both dominant)\n- Absence of B: 50% (both recessive)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C present, B absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- C absent, B present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Both absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur at 25% frequency. This sums to 100%.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 but isn't evenly distributed. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014again uneven. Option G is 12,2,2,2\u2014which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the initial parents' genotypes. Let me double-check. The first parent is CC BB, which is indeed homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the rules I outlined earlier.\n\nIf the correct answer is supposed to be among the options, and none match 25% each, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the F2 generation refers to the offspring after the F1 selfing, but considering the parents as F1 instead of CC BB and cc bb. Wait, no\u2014the problem states the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are CC BB and cc bb, producing F1 as CcBb, then F2 as described.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the options are provided, I'll need to choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nTotal progeny: 16.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4 (CC BB and CB CB)\n- Plain Red: 4 (Cc BB and CB cb)\n- Checkered Brown: 4 (cc BB and cb CB)\n- Plain Brown: 4 (cc Bb and cb cb)\n\nSo each should have 4. But the options don't include this. Perhaps the user intended to consider that when both genes are recessive, it results in checkered, regardless of the other alleles. But in reality, that's already accounted for in the phenotype.\n\nWait, another angle: The user might have confused the F1 with the F2. But no, the question specifically asks about F2.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps none is correct, but since the user expects an answer, I'll select the option that best fits the correct reasoning. However, the correct answer should have each phenotype at 25%, so none of the options provided seem to match exactly. Therefore, perhaps the question has a typo or the options are incorrect.\n\nBut since the options are provided, and the most logical choice based on the correct calculation would be that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, which is 4 instances in a 16-progeny scenario. But the options don't have such a distribution. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is D, as it's the most balanced among the choices.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is clearly uneven. Option H is 5,3,2,6. None align with 4 each. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but in the context of multiple-choice questions, I must choose the closest. However, given my analysis, the correct answer should be that each phenotype occurs 25%, which isn't among the options. Thus, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me try calculating the actual number of each phenotype in F2. Using the Punnett square approach:\n\nParents: CC BB and cc bb.\n\nF1: CcBb.\n\nF2: Four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are CB and cb in equal numbers).\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nSo F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, determining the phenotypes based on C and B:\n\n- CC (C present): red pigment, brown body \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc (C present): red pigment, brown body \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (no C): plain pigment, brown body \u2192 Plain Brown\n- bb (no B): plain pigment, checkered body \u2192 Plain Red\n\nEach of these has 25% occurrence, so in 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4\n- Checkered Brown: 4\n- Plain Brown: 4\n- Plain Red: 4\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, but based on the options provided, I'll select the one that reflects the highest number of checkered brown, which is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. But that still doesn't match 25% each. Alternatively, option H: 5,3,2,6\u2014still uneven.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll assume the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the closest is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. However, that's inconsistent with the 25% expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach.\n\nUpon reflection, I realize that the initial assumption about the parents might be incorrect. Perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb but rather CC BB and cc bb, leading to the same conclusion.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the F2 will have 4 x 4 = 16 possible phenotypic combinations, but many will overlap. Alternatively, considering each gene separately:\n\nFor pigment (C): presence (red) or absence (plain)\nFor body (B): presence (brown) or absence (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations like:\n\n- C present (red) & B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C present (red) & B absent (checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n- C absent (plain) & B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C absent (plain) & B absent (checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, each gene's expression is independent, so the probability of each phenotype is (probability of C being present) * (probability of B being present) plus any overlaps.\n\nWait, but actually, since each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering each trait separately and then combining them. Each gene has a 50% chance of being present (since both alleles are dominant or recessive respectively). So for pigment (C):\n\n- Presence (Red): 50%\n- Absence (Plain): 50%\n\nSimilarly, for body (B):\n\n- Presence (Brown): 50%\n- Absence (Checkered): 50%\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Pigment present, body absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pigment absent, body present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Pigment absent, body absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut wait, some phenotypes might overlap or combine into fewer distinct phenotypes, depending on dominance. However, in this case, since each gene is fully expressed (both dominant alleles present lead to the same phenotype), we don't have overlapping phenotypes. So each combination leads to a unique phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered Red, 25% Plain Red, 25% Checkered Brown, and 25% Plain Brown. That adds up to 100%, as expected.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum is 16, but each number seems high. Option G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Also sum to 18. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the parents.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (which is the same as C c c c?) Wait no, wait. Hold on! The initial statement was that the bird is a homozygous checkered red bird. Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So CC is homozygous dominant. Similarly, the other parent is a plain brown bird, which is homozygous recessive: cc and bb. Wait, no: \"a plain brown bird\" implies that the bird is homozygous recessive for both genes. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would yield the F2 generation. So each gene is independently assorting. So for the C locus: presence (red) is dominant over absence (plain). For B locus: presence (brown) is dominant over absence (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are as I thought before, with 25% each for the four phenotypes. So looking at the options:\n\nWhich option matches 25% each? None do exactly. Wait, let me see the options again:\n\nOptions are given as A through J, each with specific counts. Let me look at option H: phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculation, it should be 4 phenotypes each at 25%, i.e., 4 each contributing 4, totaling 16. Wait, no, that's not right. If each phenotype is 25%, then each category would have 4 out of 16. So each phenotype should occur 4 times. So none of the options seem to match 4 each. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no, because each gene has two possibilities, leading to four phenotypic categories. Each category would have 4 instances (since 16 total, divided equally into 4). So each phenotype should occur 4 times. Looking at the options:\n\nNone of the options match that exactly. Let me check each option:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16. But each phenotype shouldn't be 4. Similarly, option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents. Wait, the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. That would mean it's heterozygous? No, homozygous means both alleles are the same. So CC is homozygous dominant. Similarly, the other parent is homozygous recessive for both genes, so cc and bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that makes sense. So the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would lead to F2 with 25% for each of the four phenotypes.\n\nBut the options don't have such a distribution. Maybe the problem considers that each trait is expressed independently, leading to different ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the options, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait another approach: Let's calculate the actual number of each phenotype in F2. F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but due to dominance, some may collapse. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered bird is when both genes are recessive. So in the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C dominant (red): presence of C in F2.\n2. Both B dominant (brown): presence of B in F2.\n3. Both recessive (c and b): checkered.\n4. One dominant and one recessive: depends on which gene.\n\nWait, but how does the dominance affect the phenotypes? Let me think again. For pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red, regardless of the body color. Similarly, for body color, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered Red | Yes | No\nCheckered Brown | No | Yes\nPlain Red | Yes | No\nPlain Brown | No | No\n\nEach of these four possibilities exists in the F2 population. Now, let's calculate the proportion of each.\n\nGiven that each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities are:\n\n- Presence of C: 50% (since both alleles are dominant)\n- Absence of C: 50% (both recessive)\n- Presence of B: 50% (both dominant)\n- Absence of B: 50% (both recessive)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C present, B absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- C absent, B present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Both absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur at 25% frequency. This sums to 100%.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 but isn't evenly distributed. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014again uneven. Option G is 12,2,2,2\u2014which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the initial parents' genotypes. Let me double-check. The first parent is CC BB, which is indeed homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is (number of C/C, C/c, c/c) times (number of B/B, B/b, b/b).",
    "rollout": " Since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is (number of C/C, C/c, c/c) times (number of B/B, B/b, b/b). So for pigment color, there are 3 possibilities (C^2, Cc, cc). Similarly, for body color, 3 possibilities (B^2, Bb, bb). Thus, the total phenotypic categories are 3\u00d73=9. But some of these may overlap. Let me list them:\n\n1. Checkered red: Cc (p) and Bb (c) \u2192 phenotype is \"checkered red\"\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (p) and bb (c) \u2192 \"checkered brown\"\n3. Plain red: cc (p) and Bb (c) \u2192 \"plain red\"\n4. Plain brown: cc (p) and bb (c) \u2192 \"plain brown\"\n\nWait, but that's only four phenotypes. Alternatively, since each bird is determined by both genes, the phenotypes are combinations of both traits. So the actual phenotypes would be: \n\n- If the bird is Cc (for pigment) and Bb (for body), then it's \"checkered red.\"\n- If Cc and bb, then \"checkered brown.\"\n- If cc and Bb, \"plain red.\"\n- If cc and bb, \"plain brown.\"\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the question provides options where the phenotypic ratios are given as numbers like 6, 2, etc. Let me see how many birds fall into each category.\n\nSince the F2 is a dihybrid cross resulting from F1 selfing, the number of each phenotype depends on the probability of each genotype. For each gene, the probability is 25% for each combination. So for pigment color (C/c):\n\n- C^2: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- B^2: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe combined phenotypes are found by combining these percentages. Let's calculate the percentage for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both Cc and Bb \u2192 (50% Cc) * (50% Bb) = 25% of the population.\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (50%) * bb (25%) = 12.5% (since bb is 25%, Cc is 50%). So 12.5% of the population.\n3. Plain red: cc (25%) * Bb (50%) = 12.5%.\n4. Plain brown: cc (25%) * bb (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nBut wait, the sum of these percentages is 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 56.25%, which doesn't make sense because the rest must account for the remaining 43.75%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, no\u2014actually, the correct way is to consider the probabilities as multiplicative across the genes. So for each phenotype, we take the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use a Punnett square grid, considering all possible combinations. Let's create a table:\n\n|           | B^2 | Bb | bb |\n|-----------|-----|----|----|\n| C^2       |    |  ?  |  ? |\n| Cc        |    |  ?  |  ? |\n| cc        |    |  ?  |  ? |\n\nEach cell represents the combination of the parents' gametes. From the earlier analysis, the F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes. So, the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. Cc (pigment) \u00d7 Bb (body):\n   - Pigment: Cc \u2192 checkered\n   - Body: Bb \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\n2. Cc \u00d7 Bb same as above \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\n3. Same as above \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\n4. cc (pigment) \u00d7 bb (body):\n   - Pigment: cc \u2192 plain\n   - Body: bb \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 \"Plain Checkered\"\n\nWait, but according to the previous breakdown, checkered brown was 12.5%, which corresponds to option D: 1,3,9,3. But let me double-check the calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities without relying on the grid:\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n- Probability of C (C^2): 25%\n- Probability of Cc: 50%\n- Probability of cc: 25%\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- Probability of B (B^2): 25%\n- Probability of Bb: 50%\n- Probability of bb: 25%\n\nEach combination is independent, so the overall probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\n1. Checkered red: Cc (pigment) and Bb (body) \u2192 (50% Cc) * (50% Bb) = 25% of the population.\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (pigment) and bb (body) \u2192 (50% Cc) * (25% bb) = 12.5% of the population.\n3. Plain red: cc (pigment) and Bb (body) \u2192 (25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5% of the population.\n4. Plain brown: cc (pigment) and bb (body) \u2192 (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% of the population.\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 56.25%. Wait, that's less than 100%, so I must have missed something. Oh, because the other 43.75% isn't accounted for. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to realize that for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but adjusted based on dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014because the question specifies that each bird is determined by both genes, and the phenotypes are combinations of both. So the actual phenotypic ratio should reflect the product of the probabilities for each gene. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each bird has three possible pigments (red, checkered, plain) and three body colors (brown, checkered, plain), making nine possible phenotypes. Of these, only four phenotypes exist due to the dominance hierarchy.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio should be based on the products of the probabilities for each gene. Calculating the exact percentages:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability of Cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n- Checkered brown: (probability of Cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Plain red: (probability of cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Plain brown: (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 56.25%, which suggests that the other 43.75% are unaccounted for, possibly due to errors in assumption. However, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, focusing on the four phenotypes, the options suggest looking at the counts rather than percentages. Perhaps the options are scaled to whole numbers, so:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 let's say 25 individuals out of 100.\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% \u2192 12.5 individuals.\n- Plain red: 12.5 \u2192 12.5\n- Plain brown: 6.25 \u2192 6.25\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Sum: 18\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum:12\nOption A:6,2,2,2\u2192Sum:12\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192Sum:16\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192Sum:16\n\nHmm, the sums don't align perfectly. Maybe the question assumes that each combination contributes equally, ignoring the actual probabilities, thus assigning counts proportionally. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nAnother approach: for each phenotype, calculate the number of possible combinations:\n\n- Checkered red: (Cc)(Bb) \u2192 2 (for Cc) * 2 (for Bb) = 4\n- Checkered brown: (Cc)(bb) \u2192 2 * 1 = 2\n- Plain red: (cc)(Bb) \u2192 1 * 2 = 2\n- Plain brown: (cc)(bb) \u2192 1 * 1 = 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 parts. But the sum doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to Option H: 5,3,2,6. But that doesn't fit our current calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio becomes (3+1)*(3+1)=16 possible ratios, but only four phenotypes. Each phenotype's count is calculated as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (C^2 + Cc) * (B^2 + Bb) = (2/3 + 1/2) * (2/3 + 1/2)\nWait, perhaps using probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance for dominant (e.g., C) and 1/3 for recessive (e.g., c).\n\nFor pigment color: 2/3 chance of C, 1/3 chance of c.\nFor body color: 2/3 chance of B, 1/3 chance of b.\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Cc and Bb: (2/3 * 2/3) = 4/9\n- Cc and bb: (2/3 * 1/3) = 2/9\n- cc and Bb: (1/3 * 2/3) = 2/9\n- cc and bb: (1/3 * 1/3) = 1/9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. To express this as counts, assume a total of 9 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this directly. Looking back at the options, option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds up to 16. That doesn't seem right. Option G is 12,2,2,2 (sum 18), which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1 (sum 12), which might not match either. Option D is 1,3,9,3 (sum 16), which seems closer but still not matching. Option A is 6,2,6,2 (sum 16), which could be another possibility. Option E is 3,9,1,3 (sum 16). Option F is 4,4,4,4 (sum 16), which matches the 4:2:2:1 idea scaled up by 4. So perhaps the correct option is F, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 12:2:2:2, which would be option G. But I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach: using Punnett squares for dihybrid crosses.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are CB and cb. The Punnett square will have four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier thoughts. Actually, in reality, the F2 will have four phenotypes, each occurring at different frequencies. The correct Punnett square should yield:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- Plain red: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean each phenotype is 25%, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case because the phenotypes combine the two traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. According to standard dihybrid cross results, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But since the question is about the F2 generation, which typically refers to the third generation, but sometimes people refer to it as the second. However, the key point is that the correct ratio after dihybrid cross is usually 9:3:3:1. But in this case, the bird's phenotype combines both traits, so the correct ratio would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Adding these gives 16, which isn't listed as an option. However, looking back, option F is 4,4,4,4, which fits the 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's only applicable if each trait is independent and non-overlapping. But in reality, the phenotypes do overlap, so this isn't accurate. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, and option J is 2,6,3,1 (sum 12). None of these match the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, considering the question's context, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. But that's inconsistent with the standard ratio. Alternatively, the correct ratio is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, but this isn't among the options. Wait, perhaps the options are scaling the ratio differently. Option G is 12,2,2,2 (sum 18), which is 6 times the standard 2:1 ratio. That might be why it's presented as such. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers each trait separately, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not reflected in the options. Given the confusion, I'll go with option D, which states 1,3,9,3, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but based on the options, I'll choose option D because it's the closest to the 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled appropriately. However, I'm uncertain. Another angle: perhaps the checkered phenotype is only when both are dominant, and similarly for plain. But that wouldn't change the ratio significantly. I think I've spent too much time on this and need to make a choice. Based on the standard dihybrid cross, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since the options don't include this, I'll select the closest proportional representation, which might be option D: 1,3,9,3.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is (number of C/C, C/c, c/c) times (number of B/B, B/b, b/b). So for pigment color, there are 3 possibilities (C^2, Cc, cc). Similarly, for body color, 3 possibilities (B^2, Bb, bb). Thus, the total phenotypic categories are 3\u00d73=9. But some of these may overlap. Let me list them:\n\n1. Checkered red: Cc (p) and Bb (c) \u2192 phenotype is \"checkered red\"\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (p) and bb (c) \u2192 \"checkered brown\"\n3. Plain red: cc (p) and Bb (c) \u2192 \"plain red\"\n4. Plain brown: cc (p) and bb (c) \u2192 \"plain brown\"\n\nWait, but that's only four phenotypes. Alternatively, since each bird is determined by both genes, the phenotypes are combinations of both traits. So the actual phenotypes would be: \n\n- If the bird is Cc (for pigment) and Bb (for body), then it's \"checkered red.\"\n- If Cc and bb, then \"checkered brown.\"\n- If cc and Bb, \"plain red.\"\n- If cc and bb, \"plain brown.\"\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the question provides options where the phenotypic ratios are given as numbers like 6, 2, etc. Let me see how many birds fall into each category.\n\nSince the F2 is a dihybrid cross resulting from F1 selfing, the number of each phenotype depends on the probability of each genotype. For each gene, the probability is 25% for each combination. So for pigment color (C/c):\n\n- C^2: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- B^2: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe combined phenotypes are found by combining these percentages. Let's calculate the percentage for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both Cc and Bb \u2192 (50% Cc) * (50% Bb) = 25% of the population.\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (50%) * bb (25%) = 12.5% (since bb is 25%, Cc is 50%). So 12.5% of the population.\n3. Plain red: cc (25%) * Bb (50%) = 12.5%.\n4. Plain brown: cc (25%) * bb (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nBut wait, the sum of these percentages is 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 56.25%, which doesn't make sense because the rest must account for the remaining 43.75%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, no\u2014actually, the correct way is to consider the probabilities as multiplicative across the genes. So for each phenotype, we take the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use a Punnett square grid, considering all possible combinations. Let's create a table:\n\n|           | B^2 | Bb | bb |\n|-----------|-----|----|----|\n| C^2       |    |  ?  |  ? |\n| Cc        |    |  ?  |  ? |\n| cc        |    |  ?  |  ? |\n\nEach cell represents the combination of the parents' gametes. From the earlier analysis, the F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes. So, the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. Cc (pigment) \u00d7 Bb (body):\n   - Pigment: Cc \u2192 checkered\n   - Body: Bb \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\n2. Cc \u00d7 Bb same as above \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\n3. Same as above \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\n4. cc (pigment) \u00d7 bb (body):\n   - Pigment: cc \u2192 plain\n   - Body: bb \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 \"Plain Checkered\"\n\nWait, but according to the previous breakdown, checkered brown was 12.5%, which corresponds to option D: 1,3,9,3. But let me double-check the calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities without relying on the grid:\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n- Probability of C (C^2): 25%\n- Probability of Cc: 50%\n- Probability of cc: 25%\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- Probability of B (B^2): 25%\n- Probability of Bb: 50%\n- Probability of bb: 25%\n\nEach combination is independent, so the overall probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\n1. Checkered red: Cc (pigment) and Bb (body) \u2192 (50% Cc) * (50% Bb) = 25% of the population.\n2. Checkered brown: Cc (pigment) and bb (body) \u2192 (50% Cc) * (25% bb) = 12.5% of the population.\n3. Plain red: cc (pigment) and Bb (body) \u2192 (25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5% of the population.\n4. Plain brown: cc (pigment) and bb (body) \u2192 (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% of the population.\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 56.25%. Wait, that's less than 100%, so I must have missed something. Oh, because the other 43.75% isn't accounted for. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to realize that for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but adjusted based on dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014because the question specifies that each bird is determined by both genes, and the phenotypes are combinations of both. So the actual phenotypic ratio should reflect the product of the probabilities for each gene. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each bird has three possible pigments (red, checkered, plain) and three body colors (brown, checkered, plain), making nine possible phenotypes. Of these, only four phenotypes exist due to the dominance hierarchy.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio should be based on the products of the probabilities for each gene. Calculating the exact percentages:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability of Cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n- Checkered brown: (probability of Cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Plain red: (probability of cc) * (probability of Bb) = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Plain brown: (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 56.25%, which suggests that the other 43.75% are unaccounted for, possibly due to errors in assumption. However, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, focusing on the four phenotypes, the options suggest looking at the counts rather than percentages. Perhaps the options are scaled to whole numbers, so:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 let's say 25 individuals out of 100.\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% \u2192 12.5 individuals.\n- Plain red: 12.5 \u2192 12.5\n- Plain brown: 6.25 \u2192 6.25\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Sum: 18\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum:12\nOption A:6,2,2,2\u2192Sum:12\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192Sum:16\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192Sum:16\n\nHmm, the sums don't align perfectly. Maybe the question assumes that each combination contributes equally, ignoring the actual probabilities, thus assigning counts proportionally. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nAnother approach: for each phenotype, calculate the number of possible combinations:\n\n- Checkered red: (Cc)(Bb) \u2192 2 (for Cc) * 2 (for Bb) = 4\n- Checkered brown: (Cc)(bb) \u2192 2 * 1 = 2\n- Plain red: (cc)(Bb) \u2192 1 * 2 = 2\n- Plain brown: (cc)(bb) \u2192 1 * 1 = 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 parts. But the sum doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to Option H: 5,3,2,6. But that doesn't fit our current calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio becomes (3+1)*(3+1)=16 possible ratios, but only four phenotypes. Each phenotype's count is calculated as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (C^2 + Cc) * (B^2 + Bb) = (2/3 + 1/2) * (2/3 + 1/2)\nWait, perhaps using probabilities:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance for dominant (e.g., C) and 1/3 for recessive (e.g., c).\n\nFor pigment color: 2/3 chance of C, 1/3 chance of c.\nFor body color: 2/3 chance of B, 1/3 chance of b.\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Cc and Bb: (2/3 * 2/3) = 4/9\n- Cc and bb: (2/3 * 1/3) = 2/9\n- cc and Bb: (1/3 * 2/3) = 2/9\n- cc and bb: (1/3 * 1/3) = 1/9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. To express this as counts, assume a total of 9 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this directly. Looking back at the options, option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds up to 16. That doesn't seem right. Option G is 12,2,2,2 (sum 18), which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1 (sum 12), which might not match either. Option D is 1,3,9,3 (sum 16), which seems closer but still not matching. Option A is 6,2,6,2 (sum 16), which could be another possibility. Option E is 3,9,1,3 (sum 16). Option F is 4,4,4,4 (sum 16), which matches the 4:2:2:1 idea scaled up by 4. So perhaps the correct option is F, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 12:2:2:2, which would be option G. But I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach: using Punnett squares for dihybrid crosses.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are CB and cb. The Punnett square will have four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier thoughts. Actually, in reality, the F2 will have four phenotypes, each occurring at different frequencies. The correct Punnett square should yield:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- Plain red: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean each phenotype is 25%, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case because the phenotypes combine the two traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. According to standard dihybrid cross results, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But since the question is about the F2 generation, which typically refers to the third generation, but sometimes people refer to it as the second. However, the key point is that the correct ratio after dihybrid cross is usually 9:3:3:1. But in this case, the bird's phenotype combines both traits, so the correct ratio would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Adding these gives 16, which isn't listed as an option. However, looking back, option F is 4,4,4,4, which fits the 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's only applicable if each trait is independent and non-overlapping. But in reality, the phenotypes do overlap, so this isn't accurate. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, and option J is 2,6,3,1 (sum 12). None of these match the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, considering the question's context, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. But that's inconsistent with the standard ratio. Alternatively, the correct ratio is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, but this isn't among the options. Wait, perhaps the options are scaling the ratio differently. Option G is 12,2,2,2 (sum 18), which is 6 times the standard 2:1 ratio. That might be why it's presented as such. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers each trait separately, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not reflected in the options. Given the confusion, I'll go with option D, which states 1,3,9,3, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but based on the options, I'll choose option D because it's the closest to the 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled appropriately. However, I'm uncertain. Another angle: perhaps the checkered phenotype is only when both are dominant, and similarly for plain. But that wouldn't change the ratio significantly. I think I've spent too much time on this and need to make a choice. Based on the standard dihybrid cross, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since the options don't include this, I'll select the closest proportional representation, which might be option D: 1,3,9,3.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment Plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, for each gene, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Present (C): 100% (since C is dominant)\n- Absent (c): 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. If the bird is Cc, then 50% chance of C and 50% chance of c. But in our case, the F2 is derived from F1 which was CcBb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to calculate the actual probabilities.\n\nSince the F2 is derived from F1 (CcBb), which itself is derived from parents (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb), the F2 would have the following genotypes based on Mendel's laws:\n\n- For Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For Gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes | Yes\nPlain red | Yes | No\nCheckered brown | No | Yes\nPlain brown | No | No\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being present or absent.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B are present.\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since all C and B are dominant)\n   So 100% of the F2 birds are Checkered red.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because in reality, some birds might have both C and B dominant, others only one, etc. Wait, no\u2014the way the problem is structured, each bird has two traits. So the Checkered red is when both C and B are present. Similarly, plain red is when C is present but B is absent. Checkered brown is when C is absent but B is present. Plain brown is when neither C nor B are present.\n\nLet me recast it properly:\n\nPhenotype | C | B | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | C present (so always true) | B present (always true) | 100%\nPlain red | C present (always true) | B absent (probability 0%) | 0%\nCheckered brown | C absent (probability 25%) | B present (always true) | 25%\nPlain brown | C absent (25%) | B absent (25%) | 25%\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- All Checkered red birds (100%)\n- None of the other phenotypes except plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown. Wait, no, according to the above table, only Checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown exist. Wait, but how does that add up? 100% Checkered red, plus plain red (0%), checkered brown (25%), and plain brown (25%). That sums to 100%, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the F2 as having different proportions. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 is actually 25% Checkered red, 25% plain red, 25% checkered brown, and 25% plain brown. Let me see why I got confused before.\n\nAh, I see now. The confusion arises because each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined independently by the two genes. So for each trait, there are two possibilities (presence or absence of the dominant allele). Therefore, the four phenotypes are combinations of these two traits, leading to four possible phenotypic classes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of each phenotype depends on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each of the two genes is present or not, the frequencies can be calculated as follows:\n\n- All Checkered red: 100% (both C and B present)\n- Plain red: 0% (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (C absent, B present)\n- Plain brown: 25% (C absent, B absent)\n\nThis adds up to 100%, matching the calculations.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16, which exceeds 100% \u2192 Incorrect\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, 0 checkered brown, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nF. 4 each \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nJ. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nK. 4 each \u2192 Same as J \u2192 Incorrect\nL. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18 \u2192 Incorrect\nM. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nN. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nO. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nP. 4 each \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nQ. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18 \u2192 Incorrect\nR. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nS. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nT. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nU. 4 each \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nV. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18 \u2192 Incorrect\nW. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nX. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nY. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nZ. 4 each \u2192 Same \u2192 Incorrect\n\nWait, none of the options sum to 100%, which suggests I've made a mistake somewhere. Perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try another approach. Maybe the F2 isn't 25% for each phenotype, but rather something else due to incomplete dominance or other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 isn't 25% for each combination, but I don't think so because the parents are heterozygous for both genes, leading to a 25% distribution for each combination under Mendelian inheritance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't 1:1:1:1, but instead depends on dominance. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the phenotype is the same regardless of the order. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that for each gene, the bird either has the dominant or recessive allele. So, for pigment color, the bird either has C (red) or c (plain). For body color, either B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nThe possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these combines based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, considering the F2 generation, which is a result of two generations of crossing. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four possible combinations of alleles. Therefore, each phenotype should occur at 25% of the F2 population.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nAdding up to 100%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\n\nSumming to 16, which is incorrect. Option H says:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nSum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect. Option K says:\n\nK. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16 \u2192 Incorrect. Option L:\n\nL. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 12 \u2192 Incorrect.\n\nWait, none of the options match the correct 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that perhaps the answer provided in the options is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2. Another possibility is that the F2 generation refers to the cross between F1 and F1, but given the user's instruction, I think I need to proceed differently.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's original prompt, the question asks for the F2 generation, which comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would indeed have a 25% chance for each phenotype. Thus, the correct ratio should be 25% each, but none of the options reflect that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled up, and the numbers represent counts.\n\nIf each bird contributes 4 alleles (two for each gene), then the F2 would have 16 alleles in total. So 25% of 16 is 4 birds for each phenotype. Therefore, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nWhich matches option J. But option J says \"2, 6, 2, 6,\" which is half of what I calculated. Wait, no, because 25% of 16 is 4, not 2. So perhaps the user intended the number of birds per phenotype, but each bird is represented by multiple alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a scaling error.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio should have 4 birds for each phenotype, making the counts 4 each. Looking at the options, none directly say 4 each, but option J says 2, 6, 2, 6, which also sums to 16. Wait, 2+6+2+6=16, but each category represents a specific phenotype count. So 2 Checkered red, 6 plain red, etc. But according to my calculation, each should be 4. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, or I misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, not F2. If that were the case, the F1 is CcBb, and the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered red, 50% plain red, 25% checkered brown, and 25% plain brown, giving a ratio of 1:2:1:1. But none of the options reflect that. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. If that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1 part Checkered red, 2 parts plain red, 1 part checkered brown, and 1 part plain brown. But again, the options don't align with that.\n\nWait, going back to the user's options, option D says:\n\nD.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment Plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, for each gene, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Present (C): 100% (since C is dominant)\n- Absent (c): 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. If the bird is Cc, then 50% chance of C and 50% chance of c. But in our case, the F2 is derived from F1 which was CcBb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to calculate the actual probabilities.\n\nSince the F2 is derived from F1 (CcBb), which itself is derived from parents (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb), the F2 would have the following genotypes based on Mendel's laws:\n\n- For Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For Gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes | Yes\nPlain red | Yes | No\nCheckered brown | No | Yes\nPlain brown | No | No\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being present or absent.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B are present.\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since all C and B are dominant)\n   So 100% of the F2 birds are Checkered red.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because in reality, some birds might have both C and B dominant, others only one, etc. Wait, no\u2014the way the problem is structured, each bird has two traits. So the Checkered red is when both C and B are present. Similarly, plain red is when C is present but B is absent. Checkered brown is when C is absent but B is present. Plain brown is when neither C nor B are present.\n\nLet me recast it properly:\n\nPhenotype | C | B | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | C present (so always true) | B present (always true) | 100%\nPlain red | C present (always true) | B absent (probability 0%) | 0%\nCheckered brown | C absent (probability 25%) | B present (always true) | 25%\nPlain brown | C absent (25%) | B absent (25%) | 25%\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- All Checkered red birds (100%)\n- None of the other phenotypes except plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown. Wait, no, according to the above table, only Checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown exist. Wait, but how does that add up? 100% Checkered red, plus plain red (0%), checkered brown (25%), and plain brown (25%). That sums to 100%, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the F2 as having different proportions. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 is actually 25% Checkered red, 25% plain red, 25% checkered brown, and 25% plain brown. Let me see why I got confused before.\n\nAh, I see now. The confusion arises because each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined independently by the two genes. So for each trait, there are two possibilities (presence or absence of the dominant allele). Therefore, the four phenotypes are combinations of these two traits, leading to four possible phenotypic classes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of each phenotype depends on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each of the two genes is present or not, the frequencies can be calculated as follows:\n\n- All Checkered red: 100% (both C and B present)\n- Plain red: 0% (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (C absent, B present)\n- Plain brown: 25% (C absent, B absent)\n\nThis adds up to 100%, matching the calculations.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16, which exceeds 100% \u2192 Incorrect\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, 0 checkered brown, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nF. 4 each \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nJ. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nK. 4 each \u2192 Same as J \u2192 Incorrect\nL. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18 \u2192 Incorrect\nM. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nN. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nO. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nP. 4 each \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nQ. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18 \u2192 Incorrect\nR. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nS. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nT. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nU. 4 each \u2192 Sum is 12 \u2192 Incorrect\nV. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18 \u2192 Incorrect\nW. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nX. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect\nY. 2 each \u2192 Sum is 8 \u2192 Incorrect\nZ. 4 each \u2192 Same \u2192 Incorrect\n\nWait, none of the options sum to 100%, which suggests I've made a mistake somewhere. Perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try another approach. Maybe the F2 isn't 25% for each phenotype, but rather something else due to incomplete dominance or other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 isn't 25% for each combination, but I don't think so because the parents are heterozygous for both genes, leading to a 25% distribution for each combination under Mendelian inheritance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't 1:1:1:1, but instead depends on dominance. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the phenotype is the same regardless of the order. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that for each gene, the bird either has the dominant or recessive allele. So, for pigment color, the bird either has C (red) or c (plain). For body color, either B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nThe possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these combines based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, considering the F2 generation, which is a result of two generations of crossing. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four possible combinations of alleles. Therefore, each phenotype should occur at 25% of the F2 population.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nAdding up to 100%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\n\nSumming to 16, which is incorrect. Option H says:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nSum is 16 \u2192 Incorrect. Option K says:\n\nK. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16 \u2192 Incorrect. Option L:\n\nL. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 12 \u2192 Incorrect.\n\nWait, none of the options match the correct 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that perhaps the answer provided in the options is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2. Another possibility is that the F2 generation refers to the cross between F1 and F1, but given the user's instruction, I think I need to proceed differently.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's original prompt, the question asks for the F2 generation, which comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would indeed have a 25% chance for each phenotype. Thus, the correct ratio should be 25% each, but none of the options reflect that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled up, and the numbers represent counts.\n\nIf each bird contributes 4 alleles (two for each gene), then the F2 would have 16 alleles in total. So 25% of 16 is 4 birds for each phenotype. Therefore, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nWhich matches option J. But option J says \"2, 6, 2, 6,\" which is half of what I calculated. Wait, no, because 25% of 16 is 4, not 2. So perhaps the user intended the number of birds per phenotype, but each bird is represented by multiple alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a scaling error.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio should have 4 birds for each phenotype, making the counts 4 each. Looking at the options, none directly say 4 each, but option J says 2, 6, 2, 6, which also sums to 16. Wait, 2+6+2+6=16, but each category represents a specific phenotype count. So 2 Checkered red, 6 plain red, etc. But according to my calculation, each should be 4. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, or I misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, not F2. If that were the case, the F1 is CcBb, and the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered red, 50% plain red, 25% checkered brown, and 25% plain brown, giving a ratio of 1:2:1:1. But none of the options reflect that. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. If that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1 part Checkered red, 2 parts plain red, 1 part checkered brown, and 1 part plain brown. But again, the options don't align with that.\n\nWait, going back to the user's options, option D says:\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nTotal is 16, which still doesn't fit. Option E:\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16. Still not matching.\n\nOption I:\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the initial cross. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 should be CcBb, as previously stated. The F1 selfing would produce the F2, which is 25% for each phenotype as per Mendelian inheritance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options do not include this exact ratio. Instead, option G has 12, 2, 2, 2, which seems like a higher ratio. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, totaling 16. Option I has 7, 5, 1, 3, totalling 16. Option J has 2, 6, 2, 6, totalling 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's options are scaled incorrectly, and the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, but among the options, none match this. However, looking closely, option J states 2, 6, 2, 6, which sums to 16. But 2+6+2+6=16, which is correct in terms of counts. However, the actual ratio should be 4:4:4:4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, and the correct answer isn't listed.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype. Starting with the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C allele (i.e., red pigment):\n  - Since both parents are homozygous for C (CC), every offspring will have at least one C allele. So 100% chance of red pigment.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the C locus is Cc. So for the pigment color (C locus):\n\n- In F1, the C locus is Cc, so the probability of having at least one C allele is 75% (since Cc is 50%, and the dominant allele is present).\n- Therefore, 75% chance of red pigment.\n- 25% chance of plain pigment (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- In F1, the B locus is Bb (since the F1 is CcBb, so B is present in two copies? Wait, no: the F1 is CcBb, so each allele for B is present once. Wait, no\u2014it's CcBb, so for the B locus, each bird has two B alleles? No, wait: each bird is diploid, so for B locus, each bird has two B alleles if it's Bb, but CcBb means for B locus, the bird has one B and one b allele. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is CcBb, then for the B locus, the alleles are B and b. So for the B locus, the bird has one B and one b allele, making it heterozygous. Therefore, the probability of having at least one B allele (brown color) is 75% (since Bb is 50%, and B is dominant).\n\nTherefore, the overall probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B: 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present (red) and B absent (checkered): 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain red\n3.

Both C and B absent (plain): 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, converting these percentages into ratios:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio becomes 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G matches this ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene has two alleles, the number of possible phenotypes depends on the dominance hierarchy. Here, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype. Starting with the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C allele (i.e., red pigment):\n  - Since both parents are homozygous for C (CC), every offspring will have at least one C allele. So 100% chance of red pigment.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the C locus is Cc. So for the pigment color (C locus):\n\n- In F1, the C locus is Cc, so the probability of having at least one C allele is 75% (since Cc is 50%, and the dominant allele is present).\n- Therefore, 75% chance of red pigment.\n- 25% chance of plain pigment (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- In F1, the B locus is Bb (since the F1 is CcBb, so B is present in two copies? Wait, no: the F1 is CcBb, so each allele for B is present once. Wait, no\u2014it's CcBb, so for the B locus, each bird has two B alleles? No, wait: each bird is diploid, so for B locus, each bird has two B alleles if it's Bb, but CcBb means for B locus, the bird has one B and one b allele. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is CcBb, then for the B locus, the alleles are B and b. So for the B locus, the bird has one B and one b allele, making it heterozygous. Therefore, the probability of having at least one B allele (brown color) is 75% (since Bb is 50%, and B is dominant).\n\nTherefore, the overall probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B: 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present (red) and B absent (checkered): 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent (plain) and B present (brown): 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B absent (plain): 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, converting these percentages into ratios:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio becomes 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G matches this ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 Checkered red (since C is present, and B is present)\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability for each phenotype? For the C locus: each bird has a 50% chance of being C (red) or c (plain). For the B locus: each bird has a 50% chance of being B (brown) or b (checkered). Since the genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- For phenotype 1 (Red pigmented, Brown body):\n  - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- For phenotype 2 (Plain pigmented, Brown body):\n  - Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because the bird's phenotype depends on whether it's pigmented (has at least one C) and the body color (has at least one B). So for phenotype 1 (Red pigmented, Brown body):\n\n- Pigmented: C present \u2192 50%\n- Body brown: B present \u2192 50%\nSince these are independent, the combined probability is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%) for Red pigmented Brown body.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype 2: Plain pigmented Brown body:\n\n- Pigmented: c present \u2192 50%\n- Body brown: B present \u2192 50%\nCombined probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 3: Red pigmented Checkered body:\n\n- Pigmented: C present \u2192 50%\n- Body checkered: b present \u2192 50%\nCombined: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain pigmented Checkered body:\n\n- Pigmented: c present \u2192 50%\n- Body checkered: b present \u2192 50%\nCombined: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because adding up all four gives 25% each, totaling 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at the options provided (A to H), none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because according to my calculation, each phenotype should have 25% (i.e., 25 individuals out of 100), but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, going back, the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the plain color by c. Red color is C, plain c. Similarly, B is dominant brown, b is plain. The parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown).\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes would be 25% each as above. However, the options don't reflect this. Instead, looking at the options provided, option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That sums to 16, which isn't 100. Option E is similar. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but one is homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and the other is heterozygous for one gene but homozygous for the other? Wait, no\u2014the problem states both parents are homozygous. So maybe the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the squares. Perhaps the user included a detailed F1 table, but the actual question asks about F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1's offspring, i.e., F2 is the next generation after F1, which would be the F2 from F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me recalculate based on the F1 cross.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb. Its gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50%. So F2 would consist of the combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- Pigment color: C \u2192 red; c \u2192 plain.\n- Body color: B \u2192 brown; b \u2192 checkered.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- CC BB: Red pigmented, Brown body \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigmented red (since C is present), brown body (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- c c bb: Plain pigment (c absent), checkered body (b present) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb: Plain pigment, plain body \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation depends on how many times each genotype appears. From the Punnett square, we have:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (1 out of 4)\n- CcBb: 50% (2 out of 4)\n- cc bb: 25% (1 out of 4)\n\nBut wait, the F2 generation is formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, so the actual counts would be 25% each for CC BB, CcBb, and cc bb. Thus, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- checkered red: 25%\n- checkered brown: 25%\n- plain brown: 25%\n- plain red: 25%\n\nIf we assume 100 birds, then each phenotype would occur 25 times. However, the options provided do not include 25% each. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16. Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nNone of these sum to 100. This suggests that perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of the F2. Let me check:\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb, and the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% checkered red (CC BB)\n- 25% checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 25% plain red (ccBB)\n- 25% plain brown (ccBb)\n\nIf we take 100 birds, then:\n\n- 25 checkered red\n- 25 checkered brown\n- 25 plain red\n- 25 plain brown\n\nThis matches option D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Wait, no\u2014because 1/4 is 25%, but option D seems to scale differently. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is intended to represent phenotypic ratios without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. If each trait is considered separately, ignoring dominance, then:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- C \u2192 red, c \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- B \u2192 brown, b \u2192 checkered\n\nAssuming each trait is expressed regardless of the other, the phenotypic ratios would still be 25% each. But perhaps the user is considering only the presence of the dominant allele, regardless of the other. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting to consider only one trait at a time. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we consider only pigment color (assuming B is brown and b is checkered, and C is red and c is plain), then:\n\nPigment color: 25% red, 25% plain.\n\nBody color: 25% brown, 25% checkered.\n\nIf we combine these, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red and Brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Red and Checkered \u2192 plain red\n- Plain and Brown \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain and Checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nAgain, each phenotype would be 25% of the population. However, none of the options reflect this exact distribution. Option D seems to suggest 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which adds up to 16, not 100. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation rather than the F2. In F1, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (25%)\n- Checkered brown (25%)\n- Plain red (25%)\n- Plain brown (25%)\n\nBut the options don't reflect this either. Option D is the closest, showing 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\u2014which adds up to 16. This could imply scaling down, perhaps to a sample size where each phenotype is represented proportionally. Alternatively, maybe the question expects to ignore the dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to different ratios.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the question. Maybe the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. Let's see:\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb. The phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (25%)\n- Checkered brown (25%)\n- Plain red (25%)\n- Plain brown (25%)\n\nWhich aligns with option D. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16, but perhaps scaled up by a factor of 16. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent phenotypic ratios without normalization, meaning 1 part checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the most plausible answer is option D, as it reflects a 25% distribution across the phenotypes, possibly scaled down for easier counting. However, strictly speaking, each phenotype should be 25%, making the correct ratio 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation instead of F2. Given that, option D fits better, even though it's not a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, despite some discrepancies, the best choice based on the reasoning is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 Checkered red (since C is present, and B is present)\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability for each phenotype? For the C locus: each bird has a 50% chance of being C (red) or c (plain). For the B locus: each bird has a 50% chance of being B (brown) or b (checkered). Since the genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- For phenotype 1 (Red pigmented, Brown body):\n  - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- For phenotype 2 (Plain pigmented, Brown body):\n  - Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because the bird's phenotype depends on whether it's pigmented (has at least one C) and the body color (has at least one B). So for phenotype 1 (Red pigmented, Brown body):\n\n- Pigmented: C present \u2192 50%\n- Body brown: B present \u2192 50%\nSince these are independent, the combined probability is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%) for Red pigmented Brown body.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype 2: Plain pigmented Brown body:\n\n- Pigmented: c present \u2192 50%\n- Body brown: B present \u2192 50%\nCombined probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 3: Red pigmented Checkered body:\n\n- Pigmented: C present \u2192 50%\n- Body checkered: b present \u2192 50%\nCombined: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain pigmented Checkered body:\n\n- Pigmented: c present \u2192 50%\n- Body checkered: b present \u2192 50%\nCombined: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because adding up all four gives 25% each, totaling 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at the options provided (A to H), none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because according to my calculation, each phenotype should have 25% (i.e., 25 individuals out of 100), but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, going back, the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the plain color by c. Red color is C, plain c. Similarly, B is dominant brown, b is plain. The parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown).\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes would be 25% each as above. However, the options don't reflect this. Instead, looking at the options provided, option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That sums to 16, which isn't 100. Option E is similar. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but one is homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and the other is heterozygous for one gene but homozygous for the other? Wait, no\u2014the problem states both parents are homozygous. So maybe the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the squares. Perhaps the user included a detailed F1 table, but the actual question asks about F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1's offspring, i.e., F2 is the next generation after F1, which would be the F2 from F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me recalculate based on the F1 cross.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb. Its gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50%. So F2 would consist of the combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- Pigment color: C \u2192 red; c \u2192 plain.\n- Body color: B \u2192 brown; b \u2192 checkered.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- CC BB: Red pigmented, Brown body \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigmented red (since C is present), brown body (B present) \u2192 checkered brown\n- c c bb: Plain pigment (c absent), checkered body (b present) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb: Plain pigment, plain body \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation depends on how many times each genotype appears. From the Punnett square, we have:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (1 out of 4)\n- CcBb: 50% (2 out of 4)\n- cc bb: 25% (1 out of 4)\n\nBut wait, the F2 generation is formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, so the actual counts would be 25% each for CC BB, CcBb, and cc bb. Thus, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- checkered red: 25%\n- checkered brown: 25%\n- plain brown: 25%\n- plain red: 25%\n\nIf we assume 100 birds, then each phenotype would occur 25 times. However, the options provided do not include 25% each. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16. Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nNone of these sum to 100. This suggests that perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of the F2. Let me check:\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb, and the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% checkered red (CC BB)\n- 25% checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 25% plain red (ccBB)\n- 25% plain brown (ccBb)\n\nIf we take 100 birds, then:\n\n- 25 checkered red\n- 25 checkered brown\n- 25 plain red\n- 25 plain brown\n\nThis matches option D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Wait, no\u2014because 1/4 is 25%, but option D seems to scale differently. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is intended to represent phenotypic ratios without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. If each trait is considered separately, ignoring dominance, then:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- C \u2192 red, c \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- B \u2192 brown, b \u2192 checkered\n\nAssuming each trait is expressed regardless of the other, the phenotypic ratios would still be 25% each. But perhaps the user is considering only the presence of the dominant allele, regardless of the other. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting to consider only one trait at a time. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we consider only pigment color (assuming B is brown and b is checkered, and C is red and c is plain), then:\n\nPigment color: 25% red, 25% plain.\n\nBody color: 25% brown, 25% checkered.\n\nIf we combine these, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red and Brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Red and Checkered \u2192 plain red\n- Plain and Brown \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain and Checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nAgain, each phenotype would be 25% of the population. However, none of the options reflect this exact distribution. Option D seems to suggest 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which adds up to 16, not 100. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation rather than the F2. In F1, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (25%)\n- Checkered brown (25%)\n- Plain red (25%)\n- Plain brown (25%)\n\nBut the options don't reflect this either. Option D is the closest, showing 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\u2014which adds up to 16. This could imply scaling down, perhaps to a sample size where each phenotype is represented proportionally. Alternatively, maybe the question expects to ignore the dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to different ratios.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the question. Maybe the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. Let's see:\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb. The phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (25%)\n- Checkered brown (25%)\n- Plain red (25%)\n- Plain brown (25%)\n\nWhich aligns with option D. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16, but perhaps scaled up by a factor of 16. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent phenotypic ratios without normalization, meaning 1 part checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the most plausible answer is option D, as it reflects a 25% distribution across the phenotypes, possibly scaled down for easier counting. However, strictly speaking, each phenotype should be 25%, making the correct ratio 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation instead of F2. Given that, option D fits better, even though it's not a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, despite some discrepancies, the best choice based on the reasoning is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment Red, Body Brown (C_B_): This would occur when C is dominant (so bird is red) and B is dominant (so bird is brown). \n\n2. Pigment Red, Body Checkered (C_bb): Red with checkered.\n\n3. Pigment Plain, Body Brown (cb_B_): Plain with brown.\n\n4. Pigment Plain, Body Checkered (cb_bb): Plain with checkered.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. So, for example, the probability of being red (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant), and the probability of being brown (B_) is 3/4. So the probability of being both red and brown is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of being red and checkered is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. The same applies for the other combinations. Wait, but I might be mixing up the calculations. Alternatively, since each gene contributes independently, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 4 (for each gene: present or not) times 4, giving 16 possible genotypes. Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. The phenotypic ratios can then be calculated based on how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s) | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (C_B_) | C_B_, C_Bb, cB_B_, cB_b_ | ?\nWait, no, let's clarify. For each gene:\n\n- C locus: \n  - C_: presence (red)\n  - cc: absence (plain)\n\n- B locus:\n  - B_: presence (brown)\n  - bb: absence (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, body brown.\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, body checkered.\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, body brown.\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, body checkered.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nFor C locus (C_: 3/4, cc: 1/4):\n- For C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- For C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor B locus (B_: 3/4, bb: 1/4):\n- For C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- For C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nSimilarly, for cc locus:\n- For cc_B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- For cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut now, adding these together, let's see:\n\n- Total Red Brown: 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16\n- Total Red Checkered: 3/16 + 9/16 = 12/16\n- Total Plain Brown: 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16\n- Total Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nSimplifying:\n\n- 12/16 = 3/4\n- 12/16 = 3/4\n- 6/16 = 3/8\n- 1/16 remains as is.\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up to 1. Let me re-calculate.\n\nActually, each phenotype's count is the sum of the corresponding counts for each gene. So:\n\n- Red Brown: (3/4)(3/4) + (3/4)(1/4) = 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16\n- Red Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16\n- Plain Brown: (1/4)(3/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16\n- Plain Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 12+6+4+1=23, which exceeds 16. That suggests I made a mistake in counting. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach bird can be categorized by their two traits:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n   - How many? If both C and B are dominant.\n   - Probability: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n   - Number of such birds: 9/16 of the population.\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n   - Probability: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n   - Number: 3/16\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n   - Probability: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n   - Number: 3/16\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n   - Probability: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - Number: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nExpressed as ratios, this is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nWhich matches our calculation exactly.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment Red, Body Brown (C_B_): This would occur when C is dominant (so bird is red) and B is dominant (so bird is brown). \n\n2. Pigment Red, Body Checkered (C_bb): Red with checkered.\n\n3. Pigment Plain, Body Brown (cb_B_): Plain with brown.\n\n4. Pigment Plain, Body Checkered (cb_bb): Plain with checkered.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. So, for example, the probability of being red (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant), and the probability of being brown (B_) is 3/4. So the probability of being both red and brown is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of being red and checkered is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. The same applies for the other combinations. Wait, but I might be mixing up the calculations. Alternatively, since each gene contributes independently, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 4 (for each gene: present or not) times 4, giving 16 possible genotypes. Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. The phenotypic ratios can then be calculated based on how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s) | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (C_B_) | C_B_, C_Bb, cB_B_, cB_b_ | ?\nWait, no, let's clarify. For each gene:\n\n- C locus: \n  - C_: presence (red)\n  - cc: absence (plain)\n\n- B locus:\n  - B_: presence (brown)\n  - bb: absence (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, body brown.\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, body checkered.\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, body brown.\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, body checkered.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nFor C locus (C_: 3/4, cc: 1/4):\n- For C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- For C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor B locus (B_: 3/4, bb: 1/4):\n- For C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- For C_bb: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nSimilarly, for cc locus:\n- For cc_B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- For cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut now, adding these together, let's see:\n\n- Total Red Brown: 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16\n- Total Red Checkered: 3/16 + 9/16 = 12/16\n- Total Plain Brown: 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16\n- Total Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nSimplifying:\n\n- 12/16 = 3/4\n- 12/16 = 3/4\n- 6/16 = 3/8\n- 1/16 remains as is.\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up to 1. Let me re-calculate.\n\nActually, each phenotype's count is the sum of the corresponding counts for each gene. So:\n\n- Red Brown: (3/4)(3/4) + (3/4)(1/4) = 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16\n- Red Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16\n- Plain Brown: (1/4)(3/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16\n- Plain Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 12+6+4+1=23, which exceeds 16. That suggests I made a mistake in counting. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach bird can be categorized by their two traits:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n   - How many? If both C and B are dominant.\n   - Probability: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n   - Number of such birds: 9/16 of the population.\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n   - Probability: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n   - Number: 3/16\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n   - Probability: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n   - Number: 3/16\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cc_bb)\n   - Probability: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - Number: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nExpressed as ratios, this is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nWhich matches our calculation exactly. So the correct answer should be option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo four phenotypic categories. Now, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes.\n\nFor the C locus: Pigment red (C) occurs when at least one C allele is present. For two alleles, the probability is 3/4 (since only 1/4 is cc). Similarly, pigment plain (c) is 1/4.\n\nFor the B locus: Brown (B) occurs when at least one B allele is present. Probability is 3/4, and plain (b) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this. If C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C is red. Same for B: any bird with at least one B is brown. So the four phenotypes are indeed as above, with probabilities 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. Now, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly unless I've misread something. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2013 sum to 16, but the numbers don't fit the 9,3,3,1 ratio.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16, but doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but order differs.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Hmm, J says 2,6,3,1. That adds up to 12, which isn't 16. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check. The C locus: 3/4 chance of having at least one C (red), 1/4 plain. B locus: 3/4 brown, 1/4 plain. So the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n- C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C and not B: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Not C and B: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Neither C nor B: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nYes, that seems right. So the actual ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D (1,3,9,3) if we reverse the order, but D is 1,3,9,3 which sums to 16. Alternatively, another way to represent the same ratio is 9:3:3:1, which could correspond to option D if we adjust the order. But looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This represents Checkered red (1), Plain red (3), Checkered brown (9), Plain brown (3). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1+3=4, 9+3=12, totaling 16. But according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So how does that align?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the order in the options is different. Option D lists the phenotypes as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. According to our calculation, checkered red is 9/16, plain red is 3/16, checkered brown is 3/16, and plain brown is 1/16. So the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean 9 Checkered red, 3 Plain red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain brown. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1 except perhaps option H, but let me look again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16, but numbers differ.\n\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 No.\n\nC.12,2,2,2\u2192No.\n\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192Sum 16, but the order is wrong.\n\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192No.\n\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192No.\n\nG.12,2,2,2\u2192No.\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192No.\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192No.\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192Checkered red is 2, which doesn't align with our 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me confirm:\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. So, for pigment color:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAnd the probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. So the order in the options must reflect this. Option D lists the phenotypes as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which matches our probabilities. Even though D shows 1,3,9,3, it's just a matter of labeling. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 9:3:3:1, so in terms of the options:\n\n- A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\n- B:8,4,0,4\u2192 No.\n\n- C:12,2,2,2\u2192No.\n\n- D:1,3,9,3\u2192This is 9,3,3,1 reversed. So 1 is Checkered red, 3 is Plain red, 9 is Checkered brown, 3 is Plain brown. Yes, this aligns with our ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Another possibility is that the options use letters instead of numbers, so 'D' might refer to the specific phenotype counts rather than the order. In any case, based on the analysis, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo four phenotypic categories. Now, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes.\n\nFor the C locus: Pigment red (C) occurs when at least one C allele is present. For two alleles, the probability is 3/4 (since only 1/4 is cc). Similarly, pigment plain (c) is 1/4.\n\nFor the B locus: Brown (B) occurs when at least one B allele is present. Probability is 3/4, and plain (b) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this. If C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C is red. Same for B: any bird with at least one B is brown. So the four phenotypes are indeed as above, with probabilities 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. Now, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly unless I've misread something. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2013 sum to 16, but the numbers don't fit the 9,3,3,1 ratio.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16, but doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but order differs.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Hmm, J says 2,6,3,1. That adds up to 12, which isn't 16. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check. The C locus: 3/4 chance of having at least one C (red), 1/4 plain. B locus: 3/4 brown, 1/4 plain. So the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n- C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C and not B: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Not C and B: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Neither C nor B: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nYes, that seems right. So the actual ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D (1,3,9,3) if we reverse the order, but D is 1,3,9,3 which sums to 16. Alternatively, another way to represent the same ratio is 9:3:3:1, which could correspond to option D if we adjust the order. But looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This represents Checkered red (1), Plain red (3), Checkered brown (9), Plain brown (3). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1+3=4, 9+3=12, totaling 16. But according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So how does that align?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the order in the options is different. Option D lists the phenotypes as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. According to our calculation, checkered red is 9/16, plain red is 3/16, checkered brown is 3/16, and plain brown is 1/16. So the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean 9 Checkered red, 3 Plain red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain brown. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1 except perhaps option H, but let me look again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16, but numbers differ.\n\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 No.\n\nC.12,2,2,2\u2192No.\n\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192Sum 16, but the order is wrong.\n\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192No.\n\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192No.\n\nG.12,2,2,2\u2192No.\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192No.\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192No.\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192Checkered red is 2, which doesn't align with our 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me confirm:\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. So, for pigment color:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAnd the probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. So the order in the options must reflect this. Option D lists the phenotypes as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which matches our probabilities. Even though D shows 1,3,9,3, it's just a matter of labeling. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 9:3:3:1, so in terms of the options:\n\n- A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\n- B:8,4,0,4\u2192 No.\n\n- C:12,2,2,2\u2192No.\n\n- D:1,3,9,3\u2192This is 9,3,3,1 reversed. So 1 is Checkered red, 3 is Plain red, 9 is Checkered brown, 3 is Plain brown. Yes, this aligns with our ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Another possibility is that the options use letters instead of numbers, so 'D' might refer to the specific phenotype counts rather than the order. In any case, based on the analysis, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since both genes are dominant-recessive, and the traits are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene.",
    "rollout": " Since both genes are dominant-recessive, and the traits are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene. So for each gene:\n\n- C: presence (red) \u2192 2/3 (since C is dominant over c)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. If the bird is homozygous dominant (CC) or heterozygous (Cc), then it expresses the dominant phenotype. Similarly, for the B gene, being either BB or Bb results in Brown, and bb results in Checkered. So each gene has three possible phenotypic expressions: for pigment color, presence (red) or absence (plain); for body color, presence (brown) or absence (checkered). Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 3 (pigment) * 3 (body) = 9 possible phenotypic combinations. However, some combinations may not occur due to dominance. For example, if both pigment and body are present, it's brown-red. If neither is present, it's plain-checkered. Also, certain combinations might be impossible because of the dominance hierarchy.\n\nBut in reality, since each gene's expression is independent, the phenotypic ratios for each gene are 3:1. So for each gene, the ratio is 2/3 for the dominant and 1/3 for the recessive. Therefore, combining them, the phenotypic ratios would be (3/3)*(3/3)=9 possible combinations. However, some combinations are not possible because of dominance. For example, if a bird is heterozygous for both genes (CcBb), it would express both dominant traits. But for the purpose of calculating phenotypic ratios, we can consider each gene separately and combine their ratios.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given in the answer choices, option G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because there should be zero plain brown birds. Instead, checking the actual phenotypes, let's analyze the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes from the dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, categorizing these:\n\n- Plain-brown: (cc BB) and (cc Bb) \u2192 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: plain-brown\n- Red-brown: (CC BB), (CC Bb), (Cc BB), (Cc Bb) \u2192 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-brown\n- Red-checkered: (CC bb), (Cc bb) \u2192 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-checkered\n- Checkered: (cc BB), (cc Bb), (cc bb) \u2192 5 cases \u2192 Phenotype: checkered\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+4+2+5=13, which exceeds the expected 9. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Let's recount:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Plain-brown: 2 (cases 7 and 8) \u2192 Phenotype: plain-brown\n- Red-brown: 4 (cases 1,2,4,5) \u2192 Phenotype: red-brown\n- Red-checkered: 2 (cases 3 and 6) \u2192 Phenotype: red-checkered\n- Checkered: 5 (cases 7,8,9) \u2192 Phenotype: checkered\n\nTotal: 2+4+2+5=13, which seems off because the expected phenotypic ratio for two independent traits with 3:1 each would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the traits are linked or independent. In this case, they are independent, so each gene contributes equally. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be (3/3)*(3/3)=9:3:3:1. But our calculation shows 2:4:2:5, which adds up to 13. This discrepancy arises because the number of individuals in each phenotypic category must add up to the total population. However, without knowing the total number, we focus on the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype. For each bird, the probability of having a particular phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): probability = 2/3 (if heterozygous)\n- Absence (plain): probability = 1/3\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): probability = 2/3 (if heterozygous)\n- Absence (checkered): probability = 1/3\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Both dominant: (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 \u2192 red-brown\n- Pig present, body absent: (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9 \u2192 red-checkered\n- Pig absent, body present: (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9 \u2192 plain-brown\n- Both absent: (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThese ratios sum to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this exact ratio, but let's see:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption A: 6:2:2:6 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption F: 4,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Closest to our calculation, but the counts don't align exactly because the ratios are fractions of the total population. However, the question asks for phenotypic ratios, which can be expressed as whole numbers relative to the total. If we assume a large population, say 18 birds, the counts would be 8 red-brown, 4 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 3 plain-checkered. But none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the phenotypes aren't as I thought.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the checkered phenotype refers to both genes being recessive, i.e., cc bb. So plain-checkered is the same as plain-brown in terms of phenotype, which conflicts with earlier analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, regardless of color. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to one gene being dominant and the other recessive. For example:\n\n- C dominant and B recessive: red-checkered\n- C recessive and B dominant: plain-brown\n- C recessive and B recessive: plain-checkered\n\nIn this scenario, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red-checkered: C B\n- Plain-brown: bb Bb\n- Plain-checkered: cc BB\n\nBut that changes the ratios. Let me recalculate under this new assumption.\n\nIf \"checkered\" is when one gene is dominant and the other is recessive, then:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. C B: red-checkered \u2192 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n2. bb Bb: plain-brown \u2192 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n3. cc BB: plain-checkered \u2192 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n4. cc bb: plain-brown \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n\nWait, this still sums to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1. But now, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red-checkered: 4 parts\n- Plain-brown: 3 parts (2/9 + 1/9)\n- Plain-checkered: 2 parts (2/9)\n\nThis doesn't align with any of the options provided, which likely follow the initial assumption where checkered is when both genes are recessive.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options, Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't match my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Another approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and count the phenotypes accordingly, assigning numerical values to each phenotype.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | red-brown\nCC Bb | red-brown\nCC bb | plain-checkered\nCc BB | red-checkered\nCc Bb | red-checkered\nCc bb | plain-checkered\ncc BB | plain-brown\ncc Bb | plain-brown\ncc bb | plain-checkered\n\nCounting:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-brown\n- red-checkered: 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-checkered\n- plain-checkered: 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: plain-checkered\n- plain-brown: 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: plain-brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:4:2, which simplifies to 2:1:2:1. However, this doesn't match any of the options directly. Looking at the options again, perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as having at least one recessive allele, making the phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: C B\n- red: C b (since B is dominant)\n- plain: bb\n- plain-checkered: cc Bb (wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, it's plain-checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, it's plain-checkered. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it's red-checkered. So:\n\n- red-brown: C B\n- red-checkered: C b\n- plain-brown: bb Bb\n- plain-checkered: cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014correctly:\n\n- C B \u2192 red-brown\n- C b \u2192 red-checkered\n- bb Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, that's different from before. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown: 4 cases\n2. red-checkered: 2 cases\n3. plain-brown: 2 cases\n4. plain-checkered: 3 cases (from cc Bb and cc bb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases\n- red-checkered: 2 cases\n- plain-checkered: 3 cases (cases 3,6,9)\n- plain-brown: 2 cases (cases 7,8)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:3:2, but this doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count differently:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. So:\n\n- Pigment red \u2192 presence (R): cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Pigment brown \u2192 presence (B): cases 6,9 \u2192 2\n- Body checkered \u2192 presence (b): cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n- Body plain \u2192 presence (b): cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 4 cases\n2. Pigment red and body plain \u2192 2 cases\n3. Pigment brown and body checkered \u2192 3 cases\n4. Pigment brown and body plain \u2192 2 cases\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:3:2, but this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats \"checkered\" as having at least one recessive allele, making the phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: C B\n- red: C b\n- plain-brown: bb Bb\n- plain: cc Bb\n\nWhich gives the same ratio as before. Still, the options don't match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThat would mean no plain brown birds, which contradicts the fact that plain-brown is possible (cases 7 and 8). Therefore, Option G is incorrect.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm, this could imply that 5 are red-checkered, 3 are brown-checkered, 2 are red plain, and 6 are brown plain. But according to my previous count, there are 4 red-brown, 2 red-checkered, 3 plain-checkered, and 2 plain-brown. None of these match the options except perhaps Option E, but E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, which doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reevaluate the dihybrid cross. The dihybrid cross involves two genes, each with two alleles. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAs before, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown\n2. red-brown\n3. plain-checkered\n4. red-checkered\n5. red-checkered\n6. plain-checkered\n7. plain-brown\n8. plain-brown\n9. plain-checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases\n- red-checkered: 2 cases\n- plain-checkered: 3 cases\n- plain-brown: 2 cases\n\nNow, if we treat \"checkered\" as having at least one recessive allele, then:\n\n- red-checkered: cases 4,5 \u2192 2\n- plain-checkered: cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n- red-brown: 4\n- plain-brown: 2\n\nBut the options suggest different counts. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which again doesn't fit. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let's clarify:\n\n- Pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for the bird to be red, it needs at least one R allele (C). For the body to be brown, at least one B allele (B). Only when neither condition is met does the bird become plain or checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown: C B\n2. red-brown: C b\n3. plain-checkered: c B\n4. plain-brown: cc Bb\n\nWait, no. Wait, C is dominant for pigment, so any bird with at least one C is red. For body color, B is dominant for brown, so any bird with at least one B is brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since both genes are dominant-recessive, and the traits are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene. So for each gene:\n\n- C: presence (red) \u2192 2/3 (since C is dominant over c)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. If the bird is homozygous dominant (CC) or heterozygous (Cc), then it expresses the dominant phenotype. Similarly, for the B gene, being either BB or Bb results in Brown, and bb results in Checkered. So each gene has three possible phenotypic expressions: for pigment color, presence (red) or absence (plain); for body color, presence (brown) or absence (checkered). Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 3 (pigment) * 3 (body) = 9 possible phenotypic combinations. However, some combinations may not occur due to dominance. For example, if both pigment and body are present, it's brown-red. If neither is present, it's plain-checkered. Also, certain combinations might be impossible because of the dominance hierarchy.\n\nBut in reality, since each gene's expression is independent, the phenotypic ratios for each gene are 3:1. So for each gene, the ratio is 2/3 for the dominant and 1/3 for the recessive. Therefore, combining them, the phenotypic ratios would be (3/3)*(3/3)=9 possible combinations. However, some combinations are not possible because of dominance. For example, if a bird is heterozygous for both genes (CcBb), it would express both dominant traits. But for the purpose of calculating phenotypic ratios, we can consider each gene separately and combine their ratios.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given in the answer choices, option G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because there should be zero plain brown birds. Instead, checking the actual phenotypes, let's analyze the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes from the dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, categorizing these:\n\n- Plain-brown: (cc BB) and (cc Bb) \u2192 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: plain-brown\n- Red-brown: (CC BB), (CC Bb), (Cc BB), (Cc Bb) \u2192 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-brown\n- Red-checkered: (CC bb), (Cc bb) \u2192 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-checkered\n- Checkered: (cc BB), (cc Bb), (cc bb) \u2192 5 cases \u2192 Phenotype: checkered\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+4+2+5=13, which exceeds the expected 9. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Let's recount:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Plain-brown: 2 (cases 7 and 8) \u2192 Phenotype: plain-brown\n- Red-brown: 4 (cases 1,2,4,5) \u2192 Phenotype: red-brown\n- Red-checkered: 2 (cases 3 and 6) \u2192 Phenotype: red-checkered\n- Checkered: 5 (cases 7,8,9) \u2192 Phenotype: checkered\n\nTotal: 2+4+2+5=13, which seems off because the expected phenotypic ratio for two independent traits with 3:1 each would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the traits are linked or independent. In this case, they are independent, so each gene contributes equally. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be (3/3)*(3/3)=9:3:3:1. But our calculation shows 2:4:2:5, which adds up to 13. This discrepancy arises because the number of individuals in each phenotypic category must add up to the total population. However, without knowing the total number, we focus on the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype. For each bird, the probability of having a particular phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): probability = 2/3 (if heterozygous)\n- Absence (plain): probability = 1/3\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): probability = 2/3 (if heterozygous)\n- Absence (checkered): probability = 1/3\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Both dominant: (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 \u2192 red-brown\n- Pig present, body absent: (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9 \u2192 red-checkered\n- Pig absent, body present: (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9 \u2192 plain-brown\n- Both absent: (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThese ratios sum to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this exact ratio, but let's see:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption A: 6:2:2:6 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption F: 4,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Closest to our calculation, but the counts don't align exactly because the ratios are fractions of the total population. However, the question asks for phenotypic ratios, which can be expressed as whole numbers relative to the total. If we assume a large population, say 18 birds, the counts would be 8 red-brown, 4 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 3 plain-checkered. But none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the phenotypes aren't as I thought.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the checkered phenotype refers to both genes being recessive, i.e., cc bb. So plain-checkered is the same as plain-brown in terms of phenotype, which conflicts with earlier analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, regardless of color. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to one gene being dominant and the other recessive. For example:\n\n- C dominant and B recessive: red-checkered\n- C recessive and B dominant: plain-brown\n- C recessive and B recessive: plain-checkered\n\nIn this scenario, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red-checkered: C B\n- Plain-brown: bb Bb\n- Plain-checkered: cc BB\n\nBut that changes the ratios. Let me recalculate under this new assumption.\n\nIf \"checkered\" is when one gene is dominant and the other is recessive, then:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. C B: red-checkered \u2192 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\n2. bb Bb: plain-brown \u2192 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n3. cc BB: plain-checkered \u2192 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\n4. cc bb: plain-brown \u2192 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n\nWait, this still sums to 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1. But now, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red-checkered: 4 parts\n- Plain-brown: 3 parts (2/9 + 1/9)\n- Plain-checkered: 2 parts (2/9)\n\nThis doesn't align with any of the options provided, which likely follow the initial assumption where checkered is when both genes are recessive.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options, Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't match my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Another approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and count the phenotypes accordingly, assigning numerical values to each phenotype.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | red-brown\nCC Bb | red-brown\nCC bb | plain-checkered\nCc BB | red-checkered\nCc Bb | red-checkered\nCc bb | plain-checkered\ncc BB | plain-brown\ncc Bb | plain-brown\ncc bb | plain-checkered\n\nCounting:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-brown\n- red-checkered: 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: red-checkered\n- plain-checkered: 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: plain-checkered\n- plain-brown: 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: plain-brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:4:2, which simplifies to 2:1:2:1. However, this doesn't match any of the options directly. Looking at the options again, perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as having at least one recessive allele, making the phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: C B\n- red: C b (since B is dominant)\n- plain: bb\n- plain-checkered: cc Bb (wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, it's plain-checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, it's plain-checkered. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it's red-checkered. So:\n\n- red-brown: C B\n- red-checkered: C b\n- plain-brown: bb Bb\n- plain-checkered: cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014correctly:\n\n- C B \u2192 red-brown\n- C b \u2192 red-checkered\n- bb Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, that's different from before. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown: 4 cases\n2. red-checkered: 2 cases\n3. plain-brown: 2 cases\n4. plain-checkered: 3 cases (from cc Bb and cc bb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases\n- red-checkered: 2 cases\n- plain-checkered: 3 cases (cases 3,6,9)\n- plain-brown: 2 cases (cases 7,8)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:3:2, but this doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count differently:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. So:\n\n- Pigment red \u2192 presence (R): cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Pigment brown \u2192 presence (B): cases 6,9 \u2192 2\n- Body checkered \u2192 presence (b): cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n- Body plain \u2192 presence (b): cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 4 cases\n2. Pigment red and body plain \u2192 2 cases\n3. Pigment brown and body checkered \u2192 3 cases\n4. Pigment brown and body plain \u2192 2 cases\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:3:2, but this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats \"checkered\" as having at least one recessive allele, making the phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: C B\n- red: C b\n- plain-brown: bb Bb\n- plain: cc Bb\n\nWhich gives the same ratio as before. Still, the options don't match this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThat would mean no plain brown birds, which contradicts the fact that plain-brown is possible (cases 7 and 8). Therefore, Option G is incorrect.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm, this could imply that 5 are red-checkered, 3 are brown-checkered, 2 are red plain, and 6 are brown plain. But according to my previous count, there are 4 red-brown, 2 red-checkered, 3 plain-checkered, and 2 plain-brown. None of these match the options except perhaps Option E, but E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, which doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reevaluate the dihybrid cross. The dihybrid cross involves two genes, each with two alleles. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAs before, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown\n2. red-brown\n3. plain-checkered\n4. red-checkered\n5. red-checkered\n6. plain-checkered\n7. plain-brown\n8. plain-brown\n9. plain-checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases\n- red-checkered: 2 cases\n- plain-checkered: 3 cases\n- plain-brown: 2 cases\n\nNow, if we treat \"checkered\" as having at least one recessive allele, then:\n\n- red-checkered: cases 4,5 \u2192 2\n- plain-checkered: cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n- red-brown: 4\n- plain-brown: 2\n\nBut the options suggest different counts. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which again doesn't fit. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let's clarify:\n\n- Pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for the bird to be red, it needs at least one R allele (C). For the body to be brown, at least one B allele (B). Only when neither condition is met does the bird become plain or checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown: C B\n2. red-brown: C b\n3. plain-checkered: c B\n4. plain-brown: cc Bb\n\nWait, no. Wait, C is dominant for pigment, so any bird with at least one C is red. For body color, B is dominant for brown, so any bird with at least one B is brown. Only when neither condition is met do we get plain (no C) and checkered (no B).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown (C B)\n2. red-brown (C b)\n3. plain-checkered (c B)\n4. plain-brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. red-brown\n2. red-brown\n3. plain-checkered\n4. red-checkered\n5. red-checkered\n6. plain-checkered\n7. plain-brown\n8. plain-brown\n9. plain-checkered\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- red-brown: 4\n- red-checkered: 2\n- plain-checkered: 3\n- plain-brown: 2\n\nNow, looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. However, let's look for a way to adjust these counts. Perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as having both genes recessive, which would make the phenotypes:\n\n1. red-brown\n2. red-checkered\n3. plain-checkered\n4. plain-brown\n\n",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b.",
    "rollout": " So the phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by c being recessive. Pigmentation is controlled by B and b. So the phenotype depends on both C and B. If an animal has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it's red-brown checkered. If C is present and B is absent, it's red-brown plain. If c is present (recessive), then regardless of B, it's plain. Similarly, if c is present but B is present, it's checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because c is recessive, if c is present, the animal is plain. The pigment color (C) is dominant, so if C is present, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. So the phenotype depends on whether C is present (red or plain) and B is present (brown or plain). Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain (C_b_)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain Brown (c_B_)\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 PlainPlain (c_b_)\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". So if an animal has the recessive c allele, it's plain, regardless of B. Pigmentation is determined by B and b. So the phenotype depends on both C and B. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If C is present (red) AND B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is present (red) AND B is absent (plain) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is present (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If both C and B are absent \u2192 PlainPlain\n\nNow, given that, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. Let's assume that each bird is produced randomly according to the Mendelian ratios. The F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous (CcBb). When selfed, the F2 will have the following genotype distribution: 25% CC (C_ _ _), 25% Cc (C_ _ _), 25% cc ( _ _ cc), and 25% bb ( _ _ _b). Wait, but considering the actual letters, it's better to represent them as:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB (probability 25%)\n- Bb (probability 50%)\n- bb (probability 25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ B_: Checkered Brown (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n2. C_ bb (Checkered Plain): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. cc B_: Plain Brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. cc bb (PlainPlain): 6.25%\n\nSo the ratio would be approximately 6.25 : 6.25 : 6.25 : 6.25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1, but scaled up to integers. Multiplying each by 16 gives 16:16:16:16, but looking back, the options don't seem to match this directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount. Each gene has three phenotypes, but since each is independent, the phenotypes combine into four possibilities, each with probabilities of (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25% for each phenotype. So indeed, each phenotype occurs 6.25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. But none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Looking at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems to suggest a 1:1:1:1 ratio but in smaller numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the cases where C is present, thus ignoring the plain color. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies that the checkered pattern is controlled by c, implying that without c, the bird is plain. So the phenotype depends on both C and B. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be equally distributed across the four phenotypes. But none of the options match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit our expectation of equal distribution. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Still not equal. Option G: 12,2,2,0. That implies most are checkered, which might not align. Option H: 5,3,2,6. Not equal either. Option J: 2,6,3,1. Again, unequal. Option F: 4,4,4,4. That's equal across all four phenotypes. Option A: 6,2,6,2\u2014which sums to 16, but the ratios are 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. Option C: 9,3,3,1\u2014summing to 16, 9+3+3+1=16. This suggests that checkered brown is the most common, followed by checkered red, then plain red, then plain brown. None of these match our expectation of equal distribution. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which adds up to 16. But if each phenotype occurs 6.25%, then 16 parts would make sense. But how does that translate into counts? Maybe each part represents 1 unit, so 6,2,6,2. But none of the options say 6,2,6,2\u2014they all use larger numbers. Wait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me see: the user's options were labeled as A through H, with some having different numbers. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking back, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the probabilities. The F2 generation is generated by crossing a parent (CC BB) with itself, producing a dihybrid cross. So the possible F2 genotypes after selfing are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate.

Perhaps it's better to consider that each gene segregates independently. The F2 population will have 25% for each combination of the two genes. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Both C and B are present: Checkered Brown (25%)\n- C present, B absent: Checkered Plain (25%)\n- C absent, B present: Plain Brown (25%)\n- Both C and B absent: PlainPlain (25%)\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to an equal distribution among the four phenotypes. But none of the answer options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, options like F (4,4,4,4) suggest equal numbers for each phenotype, which matches our expectation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by c being recessive. Pigmentation is controlled by B and b. So the phenotype depends on both C and B. If an animal has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it's red-brown checkered. If C is present and B is absent, it's red-brown plain. If c is present (recessive), then regardless of B, it's plain. Similarly, if c is present but B is present, it's checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because c is recessive, if c is present, the animal is plain. The pigment color (C) is dominant, so if C is present, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. So the phenotype depends on whether C is present (red or plain) and B is present (brown or plain). Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Plain (C_b_)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain Brown (c_B_)\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 PlainPlain (c_b_)\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". So if an animal has the recessive c allele, it's plain, regardless of B. Pigmentation is determined by B and b. So the phenotype depends on both C and B. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If C is present (red) AND B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is present (red) AND B is absent (plain) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is present (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If both C and B are absent \u2192 PlainPlain\n\nNow, given that, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene is dominant-recessive, the possible phenotypes are:",
    "rollout": " Since each gene is dominant-recessive, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if both C and B are present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C is present, B absent)\n- Pigment plain and brown (if C absent, B present)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B are absent)\n\nWait, but I think the actual way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to look at the genotypes of the F2 and determine what phenotype each shows.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for the phenotypes because for each gene:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it shows the corresponding phenotype.\n- If it doesn't, it shows the recessive phenotype.\n\nSo for each gene, the ratio is 3/4 for the dominant phenotype and 1/4 for the recessive.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for the dominant-dominant phenotype, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for dominant-recessive, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for recessive-dominant, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for recessive-recessive.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 9/16, 3/16, etc. Let me see the options:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. So perhaps the question expects us to count the number of birds in each phenotype category rather than the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of checkered red to checkered brown to plain red to plain brown, which might involve counting specific genotypes leading to those phenotypes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each bird in the F2 generation will have a genotype determined by the parents' gametes. From the F1, which is CcBb, each F1 bird can produce gametes CB or cb in equal amounts. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both alleles present. Let's consider each genotype and its resulting phenotype.\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C and C \u2192 Both dominant for pigment \u2192 Red\n   - Additionally, C and B are both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Red Brown\n\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented):\n   - C and C \u2192 Red Pigmented\n   - C and B \u2192 Both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Red Brown\n\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented):\n   - C and C \u2192 Plain Pigmented\n   - C and B \u2192 Both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Plain Brown\n\n4. bb (Checkered Pigmented):\n   - c and c \u2192 Checkered Pigmented\n   - c and B \u2192 Both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but the options given seem to list checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which suggests that some phenotypes are being considered separately where one trait is dominant over another. Maybe I need to clarify whether the dominance is such that brown is dominant over checkered, or vice versa.\n\nGiven the problem statement: Red color is controlled by C, which is dominant; checkered is c, recessive. Brown is controlled by B, dominant; plain is b, recessive. So, for pigment, Red (C) is dominant over plain (c). For color, Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b).\n\nTherefore, when a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it exhibits that phenotype. So, for example, if a bird has a B allele, it will display brown color regardless of the pigment trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both traits. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will be Red Brown.\n- If the bird has at least one C and no B, it will be Red Plain.\n- If the bird has no C and at least one B, it will be Checkered Brown.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it will be Checkered Plain.\n\nNow, let's go back to the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nFrom the F2 cross:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented): Phenotype: Red Brown\n- Cc (Red Pigmented): Phenotype: Red Brown\n- cc (Plain Pigmented): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- bb (Checkered Pigmented): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none directly match this breakdown unless we group them differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of each trait separately, treating each as a separate trait, even though they are inherited together. That could lead to confusion, but perhaps the intended approach is to count each trait separately.\n\nHowever, the standard approach would be to consider both traits together. Let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, for each genotype in F2:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the color trait:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nTo find the number of birds in each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red Brown**:\n   This occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n   - CG: Cc \u2192 50%\n   - CG: CC \u2192 25%\n   - CG: bb \u2192 25% (but bb has B absent, so it's not Red Brown)\n   Wait, no, better to use a table.\n\nLet me make a Punnett square for F2:\n\n```\n        B    b\n      +     |    |\n      B     |    |    | (B from B and B from B \u2192 BB, Red Brown)\n      b     |    |    |\n```\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all possible combinations:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented)\n- Cc (Red Pigmented)\n- cc (Plain Pigmented)\n- bb (Checkered)\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each genotype is 25%, 50%, 25%.\n\nAssuming that each phenotype combines multiple genotypes:\n\n- **Red Brown**: All genotypes with at least one C and at least one B \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%) \u2192 Total 75%\n- **Red Plain**: Only cc (25%) \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered Brown**: Only bb (25%) \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered Plain**: None, because if you have bb, the color is checkered, and if you have any B, the color becomes brown. So checkered plain isn't possible because having bb results in checkered, not plain.\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier reasoning because in F2, the phenotype would be based on both traits.\n\nBut according to the initial thought process, the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: Only if both are recessive for pigments and dominant for color? That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Pigment control: C (dominant) \u2192 Red; c (recessive) \u2192 plain.\n- Color control: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; b (recessive) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment Red & Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Pigment Red & Checkered \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Pigment Plain & Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Pigment Plain & Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the percentage for each:\n\n- **Red Brown**: Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 This includes CC (25%), Cc (50%), and bb (25%). Wait, no, because bb has B = b (which is recessive) and C = b. Wait, no, the bird would have C and B only if they have at least one dominant allele for both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\n- For Pigment Red (C): At least one C allele.\n- For Color Brown (B): At least one B allele.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether both traits are expressed (i.e., both have dominant alleles) or not.\n\nTherefore:\n\n1. **Red Brown**: Both C and B are present \u2192 Occurs when at least one C and at least one B.\n   - This includes:\n     - CC (Red Pigmented and Brown)\n     - Cc (Red Pigmented and Brown)\n     - bb (Plain Pigmented and Brown)\n     But wait, bb has B = b and C = b. So, if a bird has bb, it cannot express brown color because it has b for both traits. Therefore, the presence of bb would mean it has both recessive alleles, so it wouldn't exhibit brown color. Therefore, the only way to get brown color is if the bird has at least one B allele.\n\nWait, this complicates things. Because the presence of B allows brown color, regardless of the pigment trait. Similarly, presence of C allows red color, regardless of the color trait.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (color), it's Red Brown.\n- If the bird has at least one C and no B, it's Red Plain.\n- If the bird has no C but at least one B, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's Checkered Plain.\n\nThis makes sense now. So, the phenotypes are based on the presence of C and B.\n\nNow, let's compute the percentages.\n\nTotal F2 population is 100% split among the four phenotypes based on the presence of C and B.\n\n- **Red Brown**: Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n  - This includes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and bb (25%) only if they have at least one B.\n  Wait, no. Actually, the presence of at least one C and at least one B leads to Red Brown. So, the cases where the bird has at least one C and at least one B are:\n\n  - CC: 25%\n  - Cc: 50% (since any C means pigment red, and any B means color brown)\n  - bb: But bb has B = b, which is recessive, so it won't have brown color. Therefore, bb does not contribute to Red Brown. Instead, it contributes to Checkered Plain.\n\n  Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf a bird has at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (color), it's Red Brown.\n\nOtherwise, it's:\n\n- If at least one C and no B \u2192 Red Plain\n- If no C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If neither C nor B \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n1. **Red Brown**: Bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 This includes:\n   - CC: 25%\n   - Cc: 50% (since any C means pigment red, any B means color brown)\n   - bb: Wait, no. Because bb has B = b, which is recessive, so it doesn't meet the \"at least one B\" condition. Therefore, bb can't contribute to Red Brown. Instead, it falls under:\n   - **Checkered Plain**\n   \n   Wait, but then:\n\n   - **Red Brown**: 25% (CC) + 50% (Cc) = 75%?\n   - **Red Plain**: Only 25% (cc)\n   - **Checkered Brown**: 25% (bb)\n   - **Checkered Plain**: 0% (since no bird has neither C nor B without contributing to either color?)\n\nWait, this doesn't add up. Let me try a different approach. Use a Venn diagram where one circle represents C (pigment) and another represents B (color). The overlap is Red Brown. The regions outside C but inside B are Red Plain. Outside B but inside C are Checkered Brown. And outside both circles is Checkered Plain.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- The probability of overlapping (both C and B) is P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for Red Brown.\n- Probability of only C (no B): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 for Red Plain.\n- Probability of only B (no C): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 for Checkered Brown.\n- Probability of neither C nor B: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 for Checkered Plain.\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1.\n\nNow, translating to numbers:\n\n- **Red Brown**: 9/16\n- **Red Plain**: 3/16\n- **Checkered Brown**: 3/16\n- **Checkered Plain**: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none of them exactly match this breakdown except option D, which lists checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But our analysis shows that checkered brown comes from bb (pure checkered), red plain from cc (pure red), and plain brown from bb and cc combined.\n\nWait, but in reality, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for both traits to express the phenotype. So, a bird with cc (no C, no B) would not express any phenotype because both C and B are recessive. Therefore, it's pure checkered plain, not brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n- **Red Brown**: Requires at least one C and at least one B \u2192 9/16\n- **Red Plain**: Requires at least one C but no B \u2192 3/16\n- **Checkered Brown**: Requires no C but at least one B \u2192 3/16\n- **Checkered Plain**: Requires neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also not matching.\n\nLooking back, my calculation led to:\n\n- Checkered brown (from bb) being 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Checkered plain (from cc) being 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n- Red brown (9/16) \u2248 56.25%\n- Red plain (3/16) \u2248 18.75%\n\nBut the options don't have fractions. Perhaps the question is expecting counts instead of fractions.\n\nIf we assume a total population of 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Plain: 3\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Checkered Plain: 1\n\nBut this still doesn't match any option exactly. Let me read the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nSo, none of the options perfectly match my calculation. However, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant traits, regardless of whether they are expressed. In that case, checkered (without B) and red (without C) would be separate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the options are considering only the presence of each trait, not the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each trait alone, not the combination. For example:\n\n- How many birds have checkered color (regardless of pigment)?\n- How many have red pigment (regardless of color)?\n\nThat might change the interpretation. Let me recalculate based on that.\n\n**Number of birds with checkered color (B recessive)**:\n\n- These are bb (25%) and others who have B = b but may have C = anything. So, bb plus any genotype with B = b.\n\nWait, no. To have checkered color, the bird must have at least one b for color (B). So:\n\n- Any bird with B = b (regardless of C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene is dominant-recessive, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if both C and B are present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C is present, B absent)\n- Pigment plain and brown (if C absent, B present)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B are absent)\n\nWait, but I think the actual way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to look at the genotypes of the F2 and determine what phenotype each shows.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio for the phenotypes because for each gene:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it shows the corresponding phenotype.\n- If it doesn't, it shows the recessive phenotype.\n\nSo for each gene, the ratio is 3/4 for the dominant phenotype and 1/4 for the recessive.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for the dominant-dominant phenotype, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for dominant-recessive, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for recessive-dominant, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for recessive-recessive.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 9/16, 3/16, etc. Let me see the options:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. So perhaps the question expects us to count the number of birds in each phenotype category rather than the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of checkered red to checkered brown to plain red to plain brown, which might involve counting specific genotypes leading to those phenotypes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each bird in the F2 generation will have a genotype determined by the parents' gametes. From the F1, which is CcBb, each F1 bird can produce gametes CB or cb in equal amounts. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor Color (B):\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both alleles present. Let's consider each genotype and its resulting phenotype.\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented):\n   - C and C \u2192 Both dominant for pigment \u2192 Red\n   - Additionally, C and B are both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Red Brown\n\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented):\n   - C and C \u2192 Red Pigmented\n   - C and B \u2192 Both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Red Brown\n\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented):\n   - C and C \u2192 Plain Pigmented\n   - C and B \u2192 Both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Plain Brown\n\n4. bb (Checkered Pigmented):\n   - c and c \u2192 Checkered Pigmented\n   - c and B \u2192 Both dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n   - So overall, Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but the options given seem to list checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which suggests that some phenotypes are being considered separately where one trait is dominant over another. Maybe I need to clarify whether the dominance is such that brown is dominant over checkered, or vice versa.\n\nGiven the problem statement: Red color is controlled by C, which is dominant; checkered is c, recessive. Brown is controlled by B, dominant; plain is b, recessive. So, for pigment, Red (C) is dominant over plain (c). For color, Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b).\n\nTherefore, when a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it exhibits that phenotype. So, for example, if a bird has a B allele, it will display brown color regardless of the pigment trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both traits. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will be Red Brown.\n- If the bird has at least one C and no B, it will be Red Plain.\n- If the bird has no C and at least one B, it will be Checkered Brown.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it will be Checkered Plain.\n\nNow, let's go back to the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nFrom the F2 cross:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented): Phenotype: Red Brown\n- Cc (Red Pigmented): Phenotype: Red Brown\n- cc (Plain Pigmented): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- bb (Checkered Pigmented): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none directly match this breakdown unless we group them differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of each trait separately, treating each as a separate trait, even though they are inherited together. That could lead to confusion, but perhaps the intended approach is to count each trait separately.\n\nHowever, the standard approach would be to consider both traits together. Let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, for each genotype in F2:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the color trait:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nTo find the number of birds in each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red Brown**:\n   This occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n   - CG: Cc \u2192 50%\n   - CG: CC \u2192 25%\n   - CG: bb \u2192 25% (but bb has B absent, so it's not Red Brown)\n   Wait, no, better to use a table.\n\nLet me make a Punnett square for F2:\n\n```\n        B    b\n      +     |    |\n      B     |    |    | (B from B and B from B \u2192 BB, Red Brown)\n      b     |    |    |\n```\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all possible combinations:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented)\n- Cc (Red Pigmented)\n- cc (Plain Pigmented)\n- bb (Checkered)\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each genotype is 25%, 50%, 25%.\n\nAssuming that each phenotype combines multiple genotypes:\n\n- **Red Brown**: All genotypes with at least one C and at least one B \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%) \u2192 Total 75%\n- **Red Plain**: Only cc (25%) \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered Brown**: Only bb (25%) \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered Plain**: None, because if you have bb, the color is checkered, and if you have any B, the color becomes brown. So checkered plain isn't possible because having bb results in checkered, not plain.\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier reasoning because in F2, the phenotype would be based on both traits.\n\nBut according to the initial thought process, the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: Only if both are recessive for pigments and dominant for color? That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Pigment control: C (dominant) \u2192 Red; c (recessive) \u2192 plain.\n- Color control: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; b (recessive) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment Red & Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Pigment Red & Checkered \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Pigment Plain & Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Pigment Plain & Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the percentage for each:\n\n- **Red Brown**: Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 This includes CC (25%), Cc (50%), and bb (25%). Wait, no, because bb has B = b (which is recessive) and C = b. Wait, no, the bird would have C and B only if they have at least one dominant allele for both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\n- For Pigment Red (C): At least one C allele.\n- For Color Brown (B): At least one B allele.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether both traits are expressed (i.e., both have dominant alleles) or not.\n\nTherefore:\n\n1. **Red Brown**: Both C and B are present \u2192 Occurs when at least one C and at least one B.\n   - This includes:\n     - CC (Red Pigmented and Brown)\n     - Cc (Red Pigmented and Brown)\n     - bb (Plain Pigmented and Brown)\n     But wait, bb has B = b and C = b. So, if a bird has bb, it cannot express brown color because it has b for both traits. Therefore, the presence of bb would mean it has both recessive alleles, so it wouldn't exhibit brown color. Therefore, the only way to get brown color is if the bird has at least one B allele.\n\nWait, this complicates things. Because the presence of B allows brown color, regardless of the pigment trait. Similarly, presence of C allows red color, regardless of the color trait.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (color), it's Red Brown.\n- If the bird has at least one C and no B, it's Red Plain.\n- If the bird has no C but at least one B, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's Checkered Plain.\n\nThis makes sense now. So, the phenotypes are based on the presence of C and B.\n\nNow, let's compute the percentages.\n\nTotal F2 population is 100% split among the four phenotypes based on the presence of C and B.\n\n- **Red Brown**: Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n  - This includes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and bb (25%) only if they have at least one B.\n  Wait, no. Actually, the presence of at least one C and at least one B leads to Red Brown. So, the cases where the bird has at least one C and at least one B are:\n\n  - CC: 25%\n  - Cc: 50% (since any C means pigment red, and any B means color brown)\n  - bb: But bb has B = b, which is recessive, so it won't have brown color. Therefore, bb does not contribute to Red Brown. Instead, it contributes to Checkered Plain.\n\n  Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf a bird has at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (color), it's Red Brown.\n\nOtherwise, it's:\n\n- If at least one C and no B \u2192 Red Plain\n- If no C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If neither C nor B \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n1. **Red Brown**: Bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 This includes:\n   - CC: 25%\n   - Cc: 50% (since any C means pigment red, any B means color brown)\n   - bb: Wait, no. Because bb has B = b, which is recessive, so it doesn't meet the \"at least one B\" condition. Therefore, bb can't contribute to Red Brown. Instead, it falls under:\n   - **Checkered Plain**\n   \n   Wait, but then:\n\n   - **Red Brown**: 25% (CC) + 50% (Cc) = 75%?\n   - **Red Plain**: Only 25% (cc)\n   - **Checkered Brown**: 25% (bb)\n   - **Checkered Plain**: 0% (since no bird has neither C nor B without contributing to either color?)\n\nWait, this doesn't add up. Let me try a different approach. Use a Venn diagram where one circle represents C (pigment) and another represents B (color). The overlap is Red Brown. The regions outside C but inside B are Red Plain. Outside B but inside C are Checkered Brown. And outside both circles is Checkered Plain.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- The probability of overlapping (both C and B) is P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for Red Brown.\n- Probability of only C (no B): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 for Red Plain.\n- Probability of only B (no C): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 for Checkered Brown.\n- Probability of neither C nor B: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 for Checkered Plain.\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1.\n\nNow, translating to numbers:\n\n- **Red Brown**: 9/16\n- **Red Plain**: 3/16\n- **Checkered Brown**: 3/16\n- **Checkered Plain**: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none of them exactly match this breakdown except option D, which lists checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But our analysis shows that checkered brown comes from bb (pure checkered), red plain from cc (pure red), and plain brown from bb and cc combined.\n\nWait, but in reality, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for both traits to express the phenotype. So, a bird with cc (no C, no B) would not express any phenotype because both C and B are recessive. Therefore, it's pure checkered plain, not brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n- **Red Brown**: Requires at least one C and at least one B \u2192 9/16\n- **Red Plain**: Requires at least one C but no B \u2192 3/16\n- **Checkered Brown**: Requires no C but at least one B \u2192 3/16\n- **Checkered Plain**: Requires neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also not matching.\n\nLooking back, my calculation led to:\n\n- Checkered brown (from bb) being 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Checkered plain (from cc) being 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n- Red brown (9/16) \u2248 56.25%\n- Red plain (3/16) \u2248 18.75%\n\nBut the options don't have fractions. Perhaps the question is expecting counts instead of fractions.\n\nIf we assume a total population of 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Plain: 3\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Checkered Plain: 1\n\nBut this still doesn't match any option exactly. Let me read the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nSo, none of the options perfectly match my calculation. However, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant traits, regardless of whether they are expressed. In that case, checkered (without B) and red (without C) would be separate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the options are considering only the presence of each trait, not the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each trait alone, not the combination. For example:\n\n- How many birds have checkered color (regardless of pigment)?\n- How many have red pigment (regardless of color)?\n\nThat might change the interpretation. Let me recalculate based on that.\n\n**Number of birds with checkered color (B recessive)**:\n\n- These are bb (25%) and others who have B = b but may have C = anything. So, bb plus any genotype with B = b.\n\nWait, no. To have checkered color, the bird must have at least one b for color (B). So:\n\n- Any bird with B = b (regardless of C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotypes would be:",
    "rollout": " So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain red\n4. Pigment plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFirst, determine the probability for each gene:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence (C): 100% (since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will express pigment red)\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, pigment color is determined by C, but the presence of at least one C allele results in red pigment. If both alleles are c (i.e., cc), then the pigment is plain. Similarly, for color (B):\n\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Presence (b): checkered\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be determined as follows:\n\nEach gene contributes to the phenotype, and since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 100%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0%\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate because the bird could be Cc or cc. If it's Cc, it expresses red pigment, regardless of the other trait. If it's cc, it expresses plain pigment.\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 100%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0%\n\nAgain, if the bird has at least one B allele, it expresses brown; otherwise, it expresses checkered.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait. Each trait has three possibilities, but wait, no\u2014it\u2019s binary for each gene (presence or absence of the dominant allele). Therefore, each trait has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), making four possible phenotypic combinations.\n\nThe probability for each combination is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B):\n   - Probability of C = 100% (since any bird with at least one C will have red pigment)\n   - Probability of B = 100% (same logic)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 1 = 100%\n\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b):\n   - Probability of C = 100%\n   - Probability of b = 0% (since if the bird is Cc, it doesn't have a recessive allele for color)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 0 = 0%\n\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B):\n   - Probability of c = 0% (since any bird with at least one C will have pigment red)\n   - Probability of B = 100%\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 1 = 0%\n\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b):\n   - Probability of c = 0%\n   - Probability of b = 0%\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 0 = 0%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because the sum of probabilities shouldn\u2019t exceed 100%. Clearly, something is wrong here. Let me approach it differently. Instead of looking at the combined probabilities, I'll consider each possible combination of the two traits and calculate their probabilities based on the genetic makeup.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, when we combine these, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): Plain red (c_bb)\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown (B): Checkered brown (c_BB)\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b): Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype based on the parent's genotype.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) is homozygous dominant for both genes. So all its gametes will be CB.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) is homozygous recessive for both genes. All its gametes will be cb.\n\nWhen Parent 1 (CC BB) crosses with Parent 2 (cc bb), the F1 will receive one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\nSo F1 has Cc for pigment.\n\nFor the color gene (B):\n- Parent 1 contributes B\n- Parent 2 contributes b\nSo F1 has Bb for color.\n\nThus, F1 individuals are Cc Bb.\n\nIn F1, each gene is heterozygous (Cc for pigment, Bb for color). When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- For pigment: CC, Cc, cc\n- For color: BB, Bb, bb\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red (Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red (cc Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain (cc) AND Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 4: Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigmented Red (C) and Brown (B):\n\nProbability of C = 1/2 (since F1 is Cc, half chance of C and half chance of c)\nProbability of B = 1/2 (since F1 is Bb, half chance of B and half chance of b)\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Pigmented Red (C) and Checkered (b):\n\nProbability of C = 1/2\nProbability of b = 1/2\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain (cc) and Brown (B):\n\nProbability of c = 1/2\nProbability of B = 1/2\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain (cc) and Checkered (b):\n\nProbability of c = 1/2\nProbability of b = 1/2\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, but looking at the options given, none seem to match this exact distribution. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: Using Punnett squares. Let's construct the Punnett square for F1 (Cc Bb) x (Cc Bb).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the fact that each gene is independent. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios will be the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence (C) \u2192 100%\n- Absence (c) \u2192 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right because presence implies red, absence implies plain. Similarly for color (B): presence (brown), absence (checkered).\n\nSo, for Pigmented Red (C) and Brown (B):\n- Both genes are in the presence of dominant alleles \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n\nFor Pigmented Red (C) and Checkered (b):\n- Pigmented gene is present (so red), but color is absent \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n\nFor Plain (c) and Brown (B):\n- Pigmented gene is absent (plain), but color is present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nFor Plain (c) and Checkered (b):\n- Both genes are absent \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\n- Checkered red: Both genes are present \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Plain red: Pigmented present, color absent \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: Pigmented absent, color present \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: Both genes absent \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, each phenotype has a 25% probability. But the options don't include 25%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is different. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous. Wait, no\u2014the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, also homozygous.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you mate two organisms that are homozygous for both genes, like CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb and all would express both traits. Then, F2 would be the next generation. Let me try constructing the F2.\n\nF1 is Cc Bb. Mating with itself:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for the pigment gene (C/B), the possible gametes are CB and cb. Similarly for the color gene (B/B), same applies.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Actually, the possible genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for color:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n- For color (B):\n  - B \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1.

Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of the options have 25% for each phenotype. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of offspring, considering dominance and blending rather than strict Mendelian inheritance. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't being considered correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross without considering the inheritance patterns beyond simple ratios. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of viable offspring based on dominance. For example, in some cases, a bird may blend colors, but in this scenario, it's likely that blending isn't considered, and all offspring must exhibit either the dominant or recessive phenotype based on their genotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio for F2 would indeed be 25% each phenotype, leading to 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none have 25%. This suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem setup.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh, wait! It says adihybrid cross, but the question mentions dihybrid cross. Adihybrid refers to a cross involving two traits, similar to dihybrid. So, perhaps the cross involves two traits, and the Punnett square needs to account for both traits.\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, the parents are homozygous for two traits. Homozygous for both traits? Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both C and B. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous for both c and b. So, when crossed, the F1 is Cc Bb, and the F2 would have various genotypes.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is more straightforward. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. As per standard Mendelian genetics, the F2 would have 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio if both traits are independently controlled and dominant. However, in this case, each bird's color and pigment are controlled by separate genes. So, each bird would display a specific phenotype based on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which translates to 25% each phenotype. But again, the options don't reflect this. Perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore dominance and consider all offspring, even those that might blend into a phenotype, but in reality, blending isn't typical in genetics problems unless specified.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but that doesn't make sense because there are four phenotypes. Option H has 5+3+2+6=16, which also doesn't fit. Option A has 6+2+6+2=16, again not fitting. None seem to add up to 16 except option D, which sums to 1+3+9+3=16. Wait, 1+3+9+3 equals 16. That fits. So, option D has a phenotypic ratio of 1:3:9:3, totaling 16.\n\nWait, how does that happen? In a dihybrid cross where each gene has a 1:3:2:1 ratio for dominance? Wait, no\u2014that's for a single gene with three phenotypes. For two independent genes, each with two phenotypes, the ratio becomes 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to 4:4:4:4 for two genes, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But in this case, perhaps the options suggest a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of viable offspring, considering that not all eggs might develop. For instance, some birds might not survive due to environmental factors, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering blending of traits instead of strictly dominant/recessive, but that's more speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"A homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, \"homozigous\" means homozygous, but the term \"checkered\" usually refers to the coloration, not the genotype. So, a homozygous checkered red bird would mean both alleles for the red pigment and the color are dominant. Wait, no\u2014that's not possible. Because in the context of a dihybrid cross, each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the first parent is homozygous for both genes, but \"checkered\" refers to the phenotype, not the genotype. That would mean the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (so red) and at least one dominant allele for color (so brown). So, the genotype would be C B (painted red) and B b (brown). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it would have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene.\n\nWait, hold on. If the bird is checkered, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So for pigment (C), it's dominant (C), and for color (B), it's dominant (B). Thus, the genotype would be C B. But wait, that's impossible because a bird cannot have both C and B alleles at the same time\u2014they would be C B, which is C and B. But in reality, a bird can have either C or B for each gene, not both. So perhaps the term \"checkered\" refers to the color, while the phenotype is red because pigment is present. That would make more sense. So, a checkered bird has red pigment but",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain red\n4. Pigment plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFirst, determine the probability for each gene:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence (C): 100% (since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will express pigment red)\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, pigment color is determined by C, but the presence of at least one C allele results in red pigment. If both alleles are c (i.e., cc), then the pigment is plain. Similarly, for color (B):\n\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Presence (b): checkered\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be determined as follows:\n\nEach gene contributes to the phenotype, and since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 100%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0%\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate because the bird could be Cc or cc. If it's Cc, it expresses red pigment, regardless of the other trait. If it's cc, it expresses plain pigment.\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 100%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0%\n\nAgain, if the bird has at least one B allele, it expresses brown; otherwise, it expresses checkered.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait. Each trait has three possibilities, but wait, no\u2014it\u2019s binary for each gene (presence or absence of the dominant allele). Therefore, each trait has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), making four possible phenotypic combinations.\n\nThe probability for each combination is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B):\n   - Probability of C = 100% (since any bird with at least one C will have red pigment)\n   - Probability of B = 100% (same logic)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 1 = 100%\n\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b):\n   - Probability of C = 100%\n   - Probability of b = 0% (since if the bird is Cc, it doesn't have a recessive allele for color)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 0 = 0%\n\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B):\n   - Probability of c = 0% (since any bird with at least one C will have pigment red)\n   - Probability of B = 100%\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 1 = 0%\n\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b):\n   - Probability of c = 0%\n   - Probability of b = 0%\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 0 = 0%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because the sum of probabilities shouldn\u2019t exceed 100%. Clearly, something is wrong here. Let me approach it differently. Instead of looking at the combined probabilities, I'll consider each possible combination of the two traits and calculate their probabilities based on the genetic makeup.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, when we combine these, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): Plain red (c_bb)\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown (B): Checkered brown (c_BB)\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b): Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype based on the parent's genotype.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) is homozygous dominant for both genes. So all its gametes will be CB.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) is homozygous recessive for both genes. All its gametes will be cb.\n\nWhen Parent 1 (CC BB) crosses with Parent 2 (cc bb), the F1 will receive one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\nSo F1 has Cc for pigment.\n\nFor the color gene (B):\n- Parent 1 contributes B\n- Parent 2 contributes b\nSo F1 has Bb for color.\n\nThus, F1 individuals are Cc Bb.\n\nIn F1, each gene is heterozygous (Cc for pigment, Bb for color). When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- For pigment: CC, Cc, cc\n- For color: BB, Bb, bb\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red (Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red (cc Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain (cc) AND Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 4: Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigmented Red (C) and Brown (B):\n\nProbability of C = 1/2 (since F1 is Cc, half chance of C and half chance of c)\nProbability of B = 1/2 (since F1 is Bb, half chance of B and half chance of b)\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Pigmented Red (C) and Checkered (b):\n\nProbability of C = 1/2\nProbability of b = 1/2\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain (cc) and Brown (B):\n\nProbability of c = 1/2\nProbability of B = 1/2\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain (cc) and Checkered (b):\n\nProbability of c = 1/2\nProbability of b = 1/2\nCombined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, but looking at the options given, none seem to match this exact distribution. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: Using Punnett squares. Let's construct the Punnett square for F1 (Cc Bb) x (Cc Bb).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the fact that each gene is independent. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios will be the product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence (C) \u2192 100%\n- Absence (c) \u2192 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right because presence implies red, absence implies plain. Similarly for color (B): presence (brown), absence (checkered).\n\nSo, for Pigmented Red (C) and Brown (B):\n- Both genes are in the presence of dominant alleles \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n\nFor Pigmented Red (C) and Checkered (b):\n- Pigmented gene is present (so red), but color is absent \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n\nFor Plain (c) and Brown (B):\n- Pigmented gene is absent (plain), but color is present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nFor Plain (c) and Checkered (b):\n- Both genes are absent \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\n- Checkered red: Both genes are present \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Plain red: Pigmented present, color absent \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: Pigmented absent, color present \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: Both genes absent \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, each phenotype has a 25% probability. But the options don't include 25%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is different. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous. Wait, no\u2014the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, also homozygous.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you mate two organisms that are homozygous for both genes, like CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb and all would express both traits. Then, F2 would be the next generation. Let me try constructing the F2.\n\nF1 is Cc Bb. Mating with itself:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for the pigment gene (C/B), the possible gametes are CB and cb. Similarly for the color gene (B/B), same applies.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Actually, the possible genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for color:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n- For color (B):\n  - B \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor Checkered red (C and B):\n- Probability of C = 1/2\n- Probability of B = 1/2\n- Combined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain red (C and b):\n- Probability of C = 1/2\n- Probability of b = 1/2\n- Combined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Checkered brown (c and B):\n- Probability of c = 1/2\n- Probability of B = 1/2\n- Combined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nFor Plain brown (c and b):\n- Probability of c = 1/2\n- Probability of b = 1/2\n- Combined probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nWait, that still gives each phenotype as 25%, but none of the answer options match exactly. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 0, Plain brown 4\n\nC.

Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of the options have 25% for each phenotype. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of offspring, considering dominance and blending rather than strict Mendelian inheritance. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't being considered correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross without considering the inheritance patterns beyond simple ratios. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of viable offspring based on dominance. For example, in some cases, a bird may blend colors, but in this scenario, it's likely that blending isn't considered, and all offspring must exhibit either the dominant or recessive phenotype based on their genotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio for F2 would indeed be 25% each phenotype, leading to 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none have 25%. This suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem setup.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh, wait! It says adihybrid cross, but the question mentions dihybrid cross. Adihybrid refers to a cross involving two traits, similar to dihybrid. So, perhaps the cross involves two traits, and the Punnett square needs to account for both traits.\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, the parents are homozygous for two traits. Homozygous for both traits? Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both C and B. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous for both c and b. So, when crossed, the F1 is Cc Bb, and the F2 would have various genotypes.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is more straightforward. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. As per standard Mendelian genetics, the F2 would have 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio if both traits are independently controlled and dominant. However, in this case, each bird's color and pigment are controlled by separate genes. So, each bird would display a specific phenotype based on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which translates to 25% each phenotype. But again, the options don't reflect this. Perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore dominance and consider all offspring, even those that might blend into a phenotype, but in reality, blending isn't typical in genetics problems unless specified.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but that doesn't make sense because there are four phenotypes. Option H has 5+3+2+6=16, which also doesn't fit. Option A has 6+2+6+2=16, again not fitting. None seem to add up to 16 except option D, which sums to 1+3+9+3=16. Wait, 1+3+9+3 equals 16. That fits. So, option D has a phenotypic ratio of 1:3:9:3, totaling 16.\n\nWait, how does that happen? In a dihybrid cross where each gene has a 1:3:2:1 ratio for dominance? Wait, no\u2014that's for a single gene with three phenotypes. For two independent genes, each with two phenotypes, the ratio becomes 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to 4:4:4:4 for two genes, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But in this case, perhaps the options suggest a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of viable offspring, considering that not all eggs might develop. For instance, some birds might not survive due to environmental factors, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering blending of traits instead of strictly dominant/recessive, but that's more speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"A homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, \"homozigous\" means homozygous, but the term \"checkered\" usually refers to the coloration, not the genotype. So, a homozygous checkered red bird would mean both alleles for the red pigment and the color are dominant. Wait, no\u2014that's not possible. Because in the context of a dihybrid cross, each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the first parent is homozygous for both genes, but \"checkered\" refers to the phenotype, not the genotype. That would mean the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (so red) and at least one dominant allele for color (so brown). So, the genotype would be C B (painted red) and B b (brown). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it would have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene.\n\nWait, hold on. If the bird is checkered, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So for pigment (C), it's dominant (C), and for color (B), it's dominant (B). Thus, the genotype would be C B. But wait, that's impossible because a bird cannot have both C and B alleles at the same time\u2014they would be C B, which is C and B. But in reality, a bird can have either C or B for each gene, not both. So perhaps the term \"checkered\" refers to the color, while the phenotype is red because pigment is present. That would make more sense. So, a checkered bird has red pigment but",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "rollout": " So for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: red (C) or plain (c)\n- Body: brown (B) or checkered (b)\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (B) \u2192 checkered?\nWait, no, because B is dominant brown, b is checkered. So the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nBut let's consider the dominance hierarchy. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red, else plain. For body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, else checkered. So the phenotype is determined by both genes, and the order matters.\n\nLet's list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n- Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc (Cc) and Bb (Bb): same \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc (Cc) and bb (Bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n- cC (Cc) and Bb (Bb): same as above\n- Cc (Cc) and bb (bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n- cC (Cc) and bb (bb): same\n- cc (cc) and Bb (Bb): Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc (cc) and bb (bb): Plain, checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n- Cc (Cc) and bb (bb): Pigment red, checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n- etc. Wait, but I think I've got enough to calculate the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (red): 3/4 (since \u00be of the time C is present)\n- Probability of c (plain): \u00bc\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered): \u00bc\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nNow, let's compute the phenotypic ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both genes dominant (C and B). This results in red-brown.\nProbability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment dominant (C), body recessive (b). Red-checkered.\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment recessive (c), body dominant (B). Plain-brown.\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Both recessive (c and b). Plain-checkered.\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, close but not exactly 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. The phenotypes are determined by both traits. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown body (rRbB)\n2. Pigment red, Checkered body (rrbb)\n3. Plain red, Brown body (rrBb)\n4. Plain red, Checkered body (rrbb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because each gene can have two alleles, but the phenotype combines both. The actual phenotypic combinations are based on the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So let's re-examine:\n\nEach bird's genotype for pigment (C or c) and body (B or b) determines their phenotype. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown body (C_B_): All cases where C is present or B is present, except when both are recessive (c_cc).\nWait, no. Actually, if C is present (red) OR B is present (brown), then the bird is red or brown. Similarly, if c is present (plain) OR b is present (checkered), then it's plain or checkered. But the phenotype is a combination of both. So the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown body (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered body (b): red-checkered\n3. Plain color (c) AND Brown body (B): plain-brown\n4. Plain color (c) AND Checkered body (b): plain-checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each category can be calculated by determining the chance that each gene contributes the required allele.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (red) = 3/4\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor body (B):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nTo get red-brown: C must be present OR B must be present. Since these are independent, the probability is 1 minus the probability that both are recessive. So:\n\nRed-brown = 1 - (probability c and b) = 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nSimilarly, red-checkered = probability C present AND b present = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain-brown = probability c present AND B present = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain-checkered = probability c present AND b present = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nRed-brown = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2229 B) = 3/4 + 3/4 - (3/4 * 3/4) = 3/4 + 3/4 - 9/16 = 6/4 - 9/16 = 24/16 - 9/16 = 15/16\n\nRed-checkered = P(C) * P(b) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain-brown = P(c) * P(B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain-checkered = P(c) * P(b) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 15:3:3:1. Wait, but adding up 15+3+3+1=22, which isn't 16. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion now. The correct way is to count the number of each phenotype without overlapping probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently by enumerating all possible combinations and their frequencies.\n\nEach bird's genotype for C and B can be represented as:\n\n- C_ _ (C present) or cc (plain)\n- B_ _ (B present) or bb (checkered)\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ B_: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_ bb: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc B_: Plain color, Brown body \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc bb: Plain color, Checkered body \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene being present.\n\n- C_: 3/4\n- B_: 3/4\n- cc: 1/4\n- bb: 1/4\n\nSo:\n\n1. C_ B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_ bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. cc B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! Option C states phenotypic ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, it's red-brown 9, red-checkered 3, plain-brown 3, plain-checkered 1.\n\nBut looking at option C: \"Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1\" \u2014 Wait, no, that's not right because \"Checkered red\" refers to plain-red? Maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options label the phenotypes as follows:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, etc. \u2192 Seems off.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, etc.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, etc.\u2014Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled as:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, etc.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, etc.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, etc.\u2014No, that can\u2019t be right because our calculation shows checkered red as plain-red? Wait, no, in our calculation, checkered red is plain-red. Wait, hold on:\n\nIn our calculation, the phenotypes were:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 red-brown\n- Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n- Plain color, Brown body \u2192 plain-brown\n- Plain color, Checkered body \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo the labels in the options might be reversed. Perhaps in the options, \"Checkered red\" refers to what's actually plain-red?\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered red (plain-red) would be plain-checkered, which is 1 part.\n- Checkered brown (plain-brown) would be red-checkered, which is 3 parts.\n- Plain-color red (red-brown) would be red-brown, which is 9 parts.\n- Plain-color brown (red-checkered) would be red-checkered, which is 3 parts.\n\nWait, that still doesn't align perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured differently. Let me assume that in the options, \"Checkered red\" refers to what is actually red-checkered (i.e., plain-red), and vice versa.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (plain-red): 1\n- Checkered brown (plain-brown): 3\n- Plain-checkered (red-brown): 3\n- Plain-brown (red-checkered): 9\n\nWhich matches option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, plain-red is 1, plain-brown is 3, red-brown is 9, red-checkered is 3. So in terms of the options:\n\n- Checkered red = plain-red \u2192 1\n- Checkered brown = plain-brown \u2192 3\n- Plain-checkered = red-brown \u2192 3\n- Plain-brown = red-checkered \u2192 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:9.\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Simplified 3:1:3:1\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Simplified 2:1:0:1\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Simplified 6:1:1:1\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u21927:5:1:3\n\nNone of these options seem to match our 9:3:3:1 ratio unless I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use a Punnett square to explicitly list the possible genotypes and their probabilities. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with F1.\n\nThe Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | Cc    | Cc    | Cc     | Cc\n----------|--------|--------|--------|----\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n\nEach cell represents a possible genotype, and since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each genotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo, for the C locus:\n\n- C_ (pigment red) occurs with probability 3/4\n- c_ (plain) occurs with probability 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- B_ (brown) occurs with probability 3/4\n- b_ (checkered) occurs with probability 1/4\n\nThe probability of each combination is:\n\n- C_ B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_ b_: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- c_ B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- c_ b_: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- C_ B_ \u2192 red-brown: 9/16\n- C_ b_ \u2192 red-checkered: 3/16\n- c_ B_ \u2192 plain-brown: 3/16\n- c_ b_ \u2192 plain-checkered: 1/16\n\nSo, in terms of counts, assuming 16 individuals:\n\n- 9 red-brown\n- 3 red-checkered\n- 3 plain-brown\n- 1 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, none directly state this. However, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns with our findings if \"Checkered red\" refers to plain-red (which is 1 part), \"Checkered brown\" refers to plain-brown (3 parts), \"plain red\" refers to red-brown (9 parts), and \"plain brown\" refers to red-checkered (3 parts).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: red (C) or plain (c)\n- Body: brown (B) or checkered (b)\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (B) \u2192 checkered?\nWait, no, because B is dominant brown, b is checkered. So the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nBut let's consider the dominance hierarchy. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red, else plain. For body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, else checkered. So the phenotype is determined by both genes, and the order matters.\n\nLet's list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n- Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc (Cc) and Bb (Bb): same \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc (Cc) and bb (Bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n- cC (Cc) and Bb (Bb): same as above\n- Cc (Cc) and bb (bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n- cC (Cc) and bb (bb): same\n- cc (cc) and Bb (Bb): Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc (cc) and bb (bb): Plain, checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n- Cc (Cc) and bb (bb): Pigment red, checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n- etc. Wait, but I think I've got enough to calculate the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (red): 3/4 (since \u00be of the time C is present)\n- Probability of c (plain): \u00bc\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered): \u00bc\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nNow, let's compute the phenotypic ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both genes dominant (C and B). This results in red-brown.\nProbability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment dominant (C), body recessive (b). Red-checkered.\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment recessive (c), body dominant (B). Plain-brown.\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Both recessive (c and b). Plain-checkered.\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, close but not exactly 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. The phenotypes are determined by both traits. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown body (rRbB)\n2. Pigment red, Checkered body (rrbb)\n3. Plain red, Brown body (rrBb)\n4. Plain red, Checkered body (rrbb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because each gene can have two alleles, but the phenotype combines both. The actual phenotypic combinations are based on the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So let's re-examine:\n\nEach bird's genotype for pigment (C or c) and body (B or b) determines their phenotype. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown body (C_B_): All cases where C is present or B is present, except when both are recessive (c_cc).\nWait, no. Actually, if C is present (red) OR B is present (brown), then the bird is red or brown. Similarly, if c is present (plain) OR b is present (checkered), then it's plain or checkered. But the phenotype is a combination of both. So the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown body (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered body (b): red-checkered\n3. Plain color (c) AND Brown body (B): plain-brown\n4. Plain color (c) AND Checkered body (b): plain-checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each category can be calculated by determining the chance that each gene contributes the required allele.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (red) = 3/4\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor body (B):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nTo get red-brown: C must be present OR B must be present. Since these are independent, the probability is 1 minus the probability that both are recessive. So:\n\nRed-brown = 1 - (probability c and b) = 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nSimilarly, red-checkered = probability C present AND b present = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain-brown = probability c present AND B present = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain-checkered = probability c present AND b present = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nRed-brown = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2229 B) = 3/4 + 3/4 - (3/4 * 3/4) = 3/4 + 3/4 - 9/16 = 6/4 - 9/16 = 24/16 - 9/16 = 15/16\n\nRed-checkered = P(C) * P(b) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain-brown = P(c) * P(B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain-checkered = P(c) * P(b) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 15:3:3:1. Wait, but adding up 15+3+3+1=22, which isn't 16. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion now. The correct way is to count the number of each phenotype without overlapping probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently by enumerating all possible combinations and their frequencies.\n\nEach bird's genotype for C and B can be represented as:\n\n- C_ _ (C present) or cc (plain)\n- B_ _ (B present) or bb (checkered)\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ B_: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_ bb: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc B_: Plain color, Brown body \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc bb: Plain color, Checkered body \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene being present.\n\n- C_: 3/4\n- B_: 3/4\n- cc: 1/4\n- bb: 1/4\n\nSo:\n\n1. C_ B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_ bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. cc B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown : plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! Option C states phenotypic ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, it's red-brown 9, red-checkered 3, plain-brown 3, plain-checkered 1.\n\nBut looking at option C: \"Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1\" \u2014 Wait, no, that's not right because \"Checkered red\" refers to plain-red? Maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options label the phenotypes as follows:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, etc. \u2192 Seems off.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, etc.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, etc.\u2014Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled as:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, etc.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, etc.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, etc.\u2014No, that can\u2019t be right because our calculation shows checkered red as plain-red? Wait, no, in our calculation, checkered red is plain-red. Wait, hold on:\n\nIn our calculation, the phenotypes were:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 red-brown\n- Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 red-checkered\n- Plain color, Brown body \u2192 plain-brown\n- Plain color, Checkered body \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo the labels in the options might be reversed. Perhaps in the options, \"Checkered red\" refers to what's actually plain-red?\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered red (plain-red) would be plain-checkered, which is 1 part.\n- Checkered brown (plain-brown) would be red-checkered, which is 3 parts.\n- Plain-color red (red-brown) would be red-brown, which is 9 parts.\n- Plain-color brown (red-checkered) would be red-checkered, which is 3 parts.\n\nWait, that still doesn't align perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured differently. Let me assume that in the options, \"Checkered red\" refers to what is actually red-checkered (i.e., plain-red), and vice versa.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (plain-red): 1\n- Checkered brown (plain-brown): 3\n- Plain-checkered (red-brown): 3\n- Plain-brown (red-checkered): 9\n\nWhich matches option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, plain-red is 1, plain-brown is 3, red-brown is 9, red-checkered is 3. So in terms of the options:\n\n- Checkered red = plain-red \u2192 1\n- Checkered brown = plain-brown \u2192 3\n- Plain-checkered = red-brown \u2192 3\n- Plain-brown = red-checkered \u2192 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:9.\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Simplified 3:1:3:1\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Simplified 2:1:0:1\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Simplified 6:1:1:1\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u21927:5:1:3\n\nNone of these options seem to match our 9:3:3:1 ratio unless I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use a Punnett square to explicitly list the possible genotypes and their probabilities. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with F1.\n\nThe Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | Cc    | Cc    | Cc     | Cc\n----------|--------|--------|--------|----\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n         Bb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n\nEach cell represents a possible genotype, and since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each genotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo, for the C locus:\n\n- C_ (pigment red) occurs with probability 3/4\n- c_ (plain) occurs with probability 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- B_ (brown) occurs with probability 3/4\n- b_ (checkered) occurs with probability 1/4\n\nThe probability of each combination is:\n\n- C_ B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_ b_: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- c_ B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- c_ b_: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- C_ B_ \u2192 red-brown: 9/16\n- C_ b_ \u2192 red-checkered: 3/16\n- c_ B_ \u2192 plain-brown: 3/16\n- c_ b_ \u2192 plain-checkered: 1/16\n\nSo, in terms of counts, assuming 16 individuals:\n\n- 9 red-brown\n- 3 red-checkered\n- 3 plain-brown\n- 1 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, none directly state this. However, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns with our findings if \"Checkered red\" refers to plain-red (which is 1 part), \"Checkered brown\" refers to plain-brown (3 parts), \"plain red\" refers to red-brown (9 parts), and \"plain brown\" refers to red-checkered (3 parts).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b.",
    "rollout": " So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n1. Pigment color: C (red) or c (plain)\n2. Body color: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nSo possible phenotypes are:\n- Red Brown (CB)\n- Red Checkered (Cb)\n- Plain Brown (cb)\n- Plain Checkered (cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Wait, the capital letters are dominant. So Pigment color is determined by C: if C is present, it's red; else, it's plain. Similarly, body color is determined by B: if B is present, brown; else, checkered. So the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Therefore, there are four possible phenotypes: CB (Red Brown), Cb (Red Checkered), cb (Plain Brown), cc (Plain Checkered).\n\nNow, the F2 generation will express these phenotypes based on the genotypes. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the frequency of each genotype and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented, Red Body)\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. bb (Plain Pigmented, Plain Body)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nBut wait, in the F2, we don't see 'bb' because the F1 was CcBb, and when they self, the possible gametes are CB and cb, leading to F2 genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Wait, no\u2014let me recast this properly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50%). Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC (25%)\n- From CB + cb = Cc (50%)\n- From cb + CB = Cc (another 50%)\n- From cb + cb = cc (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually:\n\nEach F2 individual receives one allele from each parent. So from F1 (CcBb):\n\nParent 1 contributes either C or c for gene C,\nand B or b for gene B.\n\nParent 2 also does the same.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (from C + C)\n- Cc (from C + c)\n- cc (from c + c)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- BB (from B + B)\n- Bb (from B + b)\n- bb (from b + b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes are combinations of these. But since each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B, we'll look for the combinations of dominant traits.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the probability of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence of C (dominant) leads to red\n- Absence (c) leads to plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence of B (dominant) leads to brown\n- Absence (b) leads to checkered\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B: Red Brown (CB)\n2. C present, B absent: Red Checkered (Cb)\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown (cb)\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain Checkered (cc)\n\nTo find the proportion of each phenotype in F2, we can use the probabilities of each gene's alleles.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability of C being present is 3/4 (since C is dominant and F1 is Cc), and the probability of B being present is also 3/4 (since B is dominant and F1 is Bb).\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake in assuming that both C and B are dominant. Alternatively, perhaps the genotypes correspond directly to the phenotypes without needing to combine them. Let me try another approach.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented, Red Body)\n- Cc (Red Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n- cc (Plain Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n- bb (Plain Pigmented, Plain Body)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. So:\n\n- CC: Red Brown\n- Cc: Red Checkered\n- cc: Plain Brown\n- bb: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, what are the frequencies of each genotype in F2?\n\nFrom the previous calculation, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the fact that some of these genotypes may lead to different phenotypes. Specifically, Cc could lead to either Red Checkered or something else, depending on whether B is present or not. Wait, no\u2014the Cc genotype itself refers to the presence of C (so pigment red), and the presence of B (brown) or not (checkered). Therefore, regardless of the Cc genotype, if B is present (brown), it's Red Brown; if B is absent (checkered), it's Red Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, cc (plain pigmented) has no effect on B unless B is present or not. If B is present (brown), it's Plain Brown; if not, it's Plain Checkered.\n\nSo the actual phenotypic distribution isn't simply based on the genotype frequencies but rather on the combination of both genes.\n\nGiven that each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the probabilities of each trait combination.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the combined probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of having both C and B present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, as earlier. Similarly:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 (Red Brown)\n- C present, B absent: 3/16 (Red Checkered)\n- C absent, B present: 3/16 (Plain Brown)\n- Both C and B absent: 1/16 (Plain Checkered)\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16, which seems high. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because all phenotypes shouldn't be zero. Option H suggests checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Totaling 16. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Option B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Summing to 16. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 16. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Summing to 16.\n\nBut according to our calculation, the sum should be 16. None of the options except E sums to 16. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. So the correct answer is E. Because in F2, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1)\u2014no, wait, that doesn't align. Wait, no\u2014if each trait is determined by the presence of a dominant allele, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But in reality, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of both. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The standard 9:3:3:1 applies to two linked genes, where each is segregating into two phenotypes. In this case, each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the phenotypic ratio would still follow the 9:3:3:1 pattern, but scaled by the number of possible phenotypes. Wait, no, because each bird has two traits, each of which can be expressed or not, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, in this specific scenario, since both C and B are present in the bird to exhibit a phenotype, the phenotypic ratio is based on the combinations of both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes along with their probabilities.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented, Red Body): 25%\n- Cc (Red Pigmented, Checkered Body): 50%\n- cc (Plain Pigmented, Checkered Body): 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- cc: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n- bb: Plain Checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nAssuming that the presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in the most prominent phenotype, but in this case, each bird has two traits. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, so we need to count how many of each phenotype exist based on the probabilities.\n\nIf all four genotypes occurred equally likely, then:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Red Checkered: 50% (1/2)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Plain Checkered: 0% (0%)\n\nBut that's not matching any option. Instead, we need to consider that each bird has two traits, and the phenotypes are combinations. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the combinations of the two traits, not by the individual genotype percentages.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\n- Both C and B are present (Red Brown): 25%\n- C present, B absent (Red Checkered): 50% (because C is present, but B is not)\n- C absent, B present (Plain Brown): 25%\n- Both C and B absent (Plain Checkered): 0%\n\nBut adding these up, 25 + 50 + 25 + 0 = 100%, but the actual counts depend on the number of individuals. Assuming equal numbers, the phenotypic ratio would be proportional to the squares of the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype by considering the probabilities of each gene separately and then combining them.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- Probability of C being present (C_): 3/4\n- Probability of B being present (B_): 3/4\n\nSince the traits are independent, the probability of both C and B being present is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 (Red Brown)\nProbability of C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 (Red Checkered)\nProbability of C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 (Plain Brown)\nProbability of both C and B absent: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 (Plain Checkered)\n\nThese are the probabilities for each phenotype. Now, converting these fractions to whole numbers assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, none exactly matches this. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to the probabilities I've just calculated: 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), and 3 (plain brown). So option E is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n1. Pigment color: C (red) or c (plain)\n2. Body color: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nSo possible phenotypes are:\n- Red Brown (CB)\n- Red Checkered (Cb)\n- Plain Brown (cb)\n- Plain Checkered (cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Wait, the capital letters are dominant. So Pigment color is determined by C: if C is present, it's red; else, it's plain. Similarly, body color is determined by B: if B is present, brown; else, checkered. So the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Therefore, there are four possible phenotypes: CB (Red Brown), Cb (Red Checkered), cb (Plain Brown), cc (Plain Checkered).\n\nNow, the F2 generation will express these phenotypes based on the genotypes. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the frequency of each genotype and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (Red Pigmented, Red Body)\n   - Phenotype: Red Brown\n2. Cc (Red Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n3. cc (Plain Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. bb (Plain Pigmented, Plain Body)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nBut wait, in the F2, we don't see 'bb' because the F1 was CcBb, and when they self, the possible gametes are CB and cb, leading to F2 genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Wait, no\u2014let me recast this properly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50%). Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC (25%)\n- From CB + cb = Cc (50%)\n- From cb + CB = Cc (another 50%)\n- From cb + cb = cc (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually:\n\nEach F2 individual receives one allele from each parent. So from F1 (CcBb):\n\nParent 1 contributes either C or c for gene C,\nand B or b for gene B.\n\nParent 2 also does the same.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (from C + C)\n- Cc (from C + c)\n- cc (from c + c)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- BB (from B + B)\n- Bb (from B + b)\n- bb (from b + b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes are combinations of these. But since each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B, we'll look for the combinations of dominant traits.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the probability of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence of C (dominant) leads to red\n- Absence (c) leads to plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence of B (dominant) leads to brown\n- Absence (b) leads to checkered\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B: Red Brown (CB)\n2. C present, B absent: Red Checkered (Cb)\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown (cb)\n4. Both C and B absent: Plain Checkered (cc)\n\nTo find the proportion of each phenotype in F2, we can use the probabilities of each gene's alleles.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability of C being present is 3/4 (since C is dominant and F1 is Cc), and the probability of B being present is also 3/4 (since B is dominant and F1 is Bb).\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B absent: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake in assuming that both C and B are dominant. Alternatively, perhaps the genotypes correspond directly to the phenotypes without needing to combine them. Let me try another approach.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented, Red Body)\n- Cc (Red Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n- cc (Plain Pigmented, Checkered Body)\n- bb (Plain Pigmented, Plain Body)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. So:\n\n- CC: Red Brown\n- Cc: Red Checkered\n- cc: Plain Brown\n- bb: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, what are the frequencies of each genotype in F2?\n\nFrom the previous calculation, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the fact that some of these genotypes may lead to different phenotypes. Specifically, Cc could lead to either Red Checkered or something else, depending on whether B is present or not. Wait, no\u2014the Cc genotype itself refers to the presence of C (so pigment red), and the presence of B (brown) or not (checkered). Therefore, regardless of the Cc genotype, if B is present (brown), it's Red Brown; if B is absent (checkered), it's Red Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, cc (plain pigmented) has no effect on B unless B is present or not. If B is present (brown), it's Plain Brown; if not, it's Plain Checkered.\n\nSo the actual phenotypic distribution isn't simply based on the genotype frequencies but rather on the combination of both genes.\n\nGiven that each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the probabilities of each trait combination.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the combined probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of having both C and B present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, as earlier. Similarly:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 (Red Brown)\n- C present, B absent: 3/16 (Red Checkered)\n- C absent, B present: 3/16 (Plain Brown)\n- Both C and B absent: 1/16 (Plain Checkered)\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16, which seems high. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because all phenotypes shouldn't be zero. Option H suggests checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Totaling 16. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12, which doesn't add up to 16. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Option B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Summing to 16. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 16. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Summing to 16.\n\nBut according to our calculation, the sum should be 16. None of the options except E sums to 16. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. So the correct answer is E. Because in F2, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1)\u2014no, wait, that doesn't align. Wait, no\u2014if each trait is determined by the presence of a dominant allele, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But in reality, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of both. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes along with their probabilities.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- CC (Red Pigmented, Red Body): 25%\n- Cc (Red Pigmented, Checkered Body): 50%\n- cc (Plain Pigmented, Checkered Body): 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- cc: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n- bb: Plain Checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nAssuming that the presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in the most prominent phenotype, but in this case, each bird has two traits. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, so we need to count how many of each phenotype exist based on the probabilities.\n\nIf all four genotypes occurred equally likely, then:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Red Checkered: 50% (1/2)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Plain Checkered: 0% (0%)\n\nBut that's not matching any option. Instead, we need to consider that each bird has two traits, and the phenotypes are combinations. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the combinations of the two traits, not by the individual genotype percentages.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\n- Both C and B are present (Red Brown): 25%\n- C present, B absent (Red Checkered): 50% (because C is present, but B is not)\n- C absent, B present (Plain Brown): 25%\n- Both C and B absent (Plain Checkered): 0%\n\nBut adding these up, 25 + 50 + 25 + 0 = 100%, but the actual counts depend on the number of individuals. Assuming equal numbers, the phenotypic ratio would be proportional to the squares of the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype by considering the probabilities of each gene separately and then combining them.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- Probability of C being present (C_): 3/4\n- Probability of B being present (B_): 3/4\n\nSince the traits are independent, the probability of both C and B being present is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 (Red Brown)\nProbability of C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 (Red Checkered)\nProbability of C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 (Plain Brown)\nProbability of both C and B absent: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 (Plain Checkered)\n\nThese are the probabilities for each phenotype. Now, converting these fractions to whole numbers assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, none exactly matches this. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene has two alleles, and the presence of the dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering each gene separately and then combining them.\n\nLet me approach it systematically:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red\n- Absence of C (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B (B_) \u2192 brown\n- Absence of B (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotype will be a combination of these. So possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red brown\n2. C_ and bb: red checkered\n3. cc and B_: plain brown\n4. cc and bb: plain checkered\n\nNow, each gene has a 2:2 ratio for the presence and absence of the allele (assuming parents are homozygous). Wait, actually, the F1 is CcBb, so the proportion of each allele is 50% for each. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. So each combination (like C_, B_) has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes, but wait, let's count how many phenotypes exist. Actually, no, because some phenotypes might overlap. For example, C_ and B_ could be different from C_ and bb, depending on the dominance. Wait, but in this case, dominance is already considered, so each phenotype is distinct.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for pigment color: red (C) or plain (c).",
    "rollout": " So for pigment color: red (C) or plain (c). For body color: brown (B) or checkered (b). Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. Therefore, the order from most to least dominant phenotype would be: Red Brown > Red Checkered > Plain Brown > Plain Checkered.\n\nBut wait, the actual ordering depends on how dominance works. Since each bird can be expressed based on whether the gene is present or not, regardless of the other gene. So the phenotypes are ordered as follows:\n\n- Presence of C and B \u2192 Red Brown\n- Presence of C but not B \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Absence of C but presence of B \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Absence of C and absence of B \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the presence of the dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the phenotype is that way unless the other gene isn't affecting it. In reality, both genes determine the phenotype, but since each gene's effect is additive, the order would be based on the combination of dominant alleles. So, the phenotypes from most dominant to least would be:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (ccB_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cccc)\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because each bird could express either trait based on the presence of the dominant allele. Alternatively, the order could be determined by the sum of the dominance levels. However, without specific dominance coefficients, it's usually assumed that the presence of any dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype. So, for Pigment: Red (C) over Plain (c); for Body: Brown (B) over Checkered (b). Therefore, the phenotypes can be ranked as:\n\nRed Brown (C_B_) > Red Checkered (C_bb) > Plain Brown (ccB_) > Plain Checkered (cccc)\n\nSo now, to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we consider the probabilities of each genotype leading to each phenotype. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. \n\nThe probability of each genotype is 25% for each of the four possible genotypes (CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb), but considering the genes are independent, the actual distribution depends on the dominance hierarchy. However, since both genes are acting independently, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by considering the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to compute the probability of each phenotype by considering the likelihood of having the dominant alleles for each gene. For example, the probability of being Red Brown is the probability of having at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. Similarly for the others.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities step by step:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C = 1 - probability of having no dominant C = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nSimilarly, for Body (B):\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B = 1 - probability of having no dominant B = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for both traits being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nNow, breaking down the phenotypes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_):\n   - Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb):\n   - Has C but no B.\n   - Probability = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain Brown (ccB_):\n   - Has b but no C.\n   - Probability = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain Checkered (cccc):\n   - Neither C nor B is present.\n   - Probability = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered = 9:3:3:1\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1\nF. 1:1:1:1\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, none of these match exactly the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, but option C says 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. However, looking back, the options may have been simplified differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each gene is assorting independently, but the dominance might lead to different ratios. Wait, another approach: If we consider that each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, then:\n\n- The number of each genotype in F2 is 1 (CC), 2 (Cc), 1 (cc) for each gene. But since the two genes are independent, the actual counts would be:\n\nFor pigment (C/B):\n\nEach bird has a 3/4 chance of having at least one C, and similarly for B.\n\nThus, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Red Brown: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Red Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Brown: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", but that seems inconsistent because checkered red would imply a different category. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me see:\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThat doesn't align with 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2014 that would correspond to checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown, which doesn't make sense because checkered red would require both traits being present, which is less likely than the others.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles, not accounting for the other. But my earlier reasoning suggests 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That adds up to 16, which doesn't seem right because the total should be 16 birds.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2014 also sums to 16.\n\nOption A: 6:2 \u2014 too low.\n\nOption B: 8:4 \u2014 still too low.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2014 fits our calculation.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1 \u2014 reversed.\n\nOption F: 1:1:1:1 \u2014 all same, unlikely.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2014 mixed.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2014 nope.\n\nSo the closest matching option is C, which states the ratio as 9:3:3:1. However, in the options provided, option C is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which seems correct, despite the wording suggesting checkered red, but perhaps it's a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented, but based on our calculations, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.",
    "rollout": " So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The presence of a dominant allele in any gene leads to that trait being expressed. So the phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So for pigment color (C), the presence (red) requires at least one C allele. For body color (B), the presence (brown) requires at least one B allele. So the phenotypic ratio depends on how often each combination of these traits appears in the F2 generation.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B are present (red brown)\n- C is present, B is absent (red checkered)\n- C is absent, B is present (plain brown)\n- Neither C nor B is present (plain checkered)\n\nSo now, we calculate the probability of each combination based on Mendel's laws.\n\nFor the C locus: In F2, the probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since the only way to fail is having cc). Similarly, for the B locus: Probability of at least one B allele is also 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for having both C and B dominant.\n\nNext, the probability of having C dominant but B recessive (red checkered): This requires that the bird has at least one C (so 3/4 chance) and no B (so 1/4 chance, since B is recessive). So 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having C recessive (plain) but B dominant (brown): At least one C (1/4) and at least one B (3/4). So 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nLastly, the probability of neither C nor B (plain checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios: \n\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nTo express this as a ratio, multiply numerator by 16: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't match. Option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which would correspond to 1:3:9:3 ratio. Hmm, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking again at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but ratio 6:2:6:2 isn't matching.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, ratio 8:4:0:4, which simplifies to 2:1:0:1, not matching.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, which matches our 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer would be G if the options were presented differently, but according to the given options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nAh, no, looking back: Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 this seems off because our calculation gave 9:3:3:1. Maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps the original question expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the phenotypic ratio to be 9:3:3:1, which would make sense as each gene contributes three phenotypic categories, leading to nine possible combinations. But none of the options seem to reflect that exact ratio except perhaps option G if it was scaled up. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the counts instead of the ratio. Given that, perhaps the closest option is E, which is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014this corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which is a different ratio than what we derived. Alternatively, perhaps the user miswrote the options, and the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which would mean none of the options are correct. But looking back, the user listed options A to H, with option G being 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but 12+2+2+0=16, which could be a typo for 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's unlikely, I must re-examine my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypes: dominant C (red), recessive c (plain); dominant B (brown), recessive b (checkered).\n\nThe phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of showing the dominant trait (e.g., red) is 3/4, and the recessive trait is 1/4.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the joint probabilities are multiplicative. Thus, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. Neither C nor B dominant: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThese add up to 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! This matches our calculation perfectly. So despite the confusion, option C states the correct phenotypic ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.

So 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having C recessive (plain) but B dominant (brown): At least one C (1/4) and at least one B (3/4). So 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nLastly, the probability of neither C nor B (plain checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios: \n\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nTo express this as a ratio, multiply numerator by 16: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\".

Instead, the options present specific counts for each phenotype. So perhaps the key is to calculate the number of each type in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n1. **Parental Crosses:**\n   - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\n2. **F1 Generation:**\n   - Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, F1 will be CcBb (the only possible genotype).\n\n3. **F1 Selfing:**\n   - F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes at 50% CB and 50% cb.\n   - Thus, F2 will have the following genotypes:\n     - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n     - 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n     - 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n     - 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n- C: dominant (Red)\n- c: recessive (Plain)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- B: dominant (Brown)\n- b: recessive (Checkered)\n\nEach bird will display the phenotype where both genes are dominant.

Similarly, if B is absent, regardless of C, the bird is brown. But if both are absent, it's plain-brown.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at each bird's phenotype based on their alleles.

Wait, no: Wait, B is dominant, so bb would still express brown because B is dominant. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, B is dominant, so even if an organism is bb, it will express the dominant trait, which is brown.

So, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele), and B is present (at least one B allele), phenotype is Red-Brown.\n- If C is present but B is absent, phenotype is Red-Checkered.\n- If neither C nor B is present, phenotype is Plain-Brown.\n- If B is present but C is absent, phenotype is Brown (but according to our rules, C being absent makes it Plain. Wait, no\u2014if C is absent, regardless of B, it's Plain, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, if an organism has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will exhibit the red color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it will be brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- Both C and B are present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Brown (because B is dominant, so even without C, it's brown.)\n\nWait, but according to the initial description, the plain color is determined by recessive allele c. So, if an animal has c, it's plain, regardless of B. So, for Pigment Color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 presence (Red)\n- c is recessive \u2192 absence (Plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Body Color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 presence (Brown)\n- b is recessive \u2192 absence (Checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So, each bird's phenotype can be categorized into four possibilities:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. B present, C absent \u2192 Brown (since C is absent, it's plain, but B is present, so brown)\n\nWait, but according to the rules, if C is absent, regardless of B, it's plain. And if B is present, even without C, it's brown. So, the fourth category is simply Brown.\n\nNow, applying this to each bird in the F2 generation:\n\nFrom earlier, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown)\n- 25% Cc (C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown)\n- 25% cc (C absent, B present \u2192 Plain-Brown)\n- 25% bb (C absent, B present \u2192 Brown)\n\nWait, but this doesn't add up because 25% +25% +25% +25% =100%, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown (phenotype 1: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Red-Checkered (phenotype 2: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, Cc bb)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Let me make a table:\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 same as above \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 same as above \u2192 Red-Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Red-Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Plain-Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, now, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red-Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-Brown: Case7 \u2192 1 case\n- Brown: Cases8,9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 4 : 2 : 1 : 2.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9, which matches the sum of squares (3^2 * 3^2 = 9).\n\nLooking at the answer options, option H says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nWait, that's not matching what I got. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Red-Brown: 4 instances\n- Red-Checkered: 2 instances\n- Plain-Brown: 1 instance\n- Brown: 2 instances\n\nTotal: 9\n\nSo the ratio is 4 : 2 : 1 : 2, which translates to:\n\n- Red-Brown: 4/9\n- Red-Checkered: 2/9\n- Plain-Brown: 1/9\n- Brown: 2/9\n\nLooking at the answer choices, I don't see a ratio of 4:2:1:2. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Total 16, which is more than 9.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Did I misinterpret the question? Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me double-check.\n\nThe question states: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nSo, I did the F2 analysis correctly, getting a ratio of 4:2:1:2. But the options don't include this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4, which sums to 16. That's too high.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 genotypes. Let me try another approach. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since each gene is determined by a separate locus, and the recessive alleles are different, the actual phenotypic ratio might differ.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross is indeed 9:3:3:1, but each class corresponds to different phenotypes. However, depending on the dominance hierarchy, some classes may combine. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4 (Red-Brown) + 2 (Red-Checkered) + 1 (Plain-Brown) + 2 (Brown) = 9, which is correct. So the ratio is 4:2:1:2, but that isn't among the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me recalculate the F1 phenotypes.\n\nF1 is all Cc BB and cb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. So, F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the dihybrid cross, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nWait, let me consider dominance. For each gene:\n\n- C is dominant (Red)\n- B is dominant (Brown)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations where each gene contributes to the phenotype. The 9:3:3:1 ratio applies to the total F2 population. Let's apply it:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 =16.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. All RR: 9 \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. All RB: 3 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. All BR: 3 \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n4. All BB: 1 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nBut wait, that's under the assumption that the dominance applies to each trait separately. Alternatively, the standard 9:3:3:1 applies where each trait is expressed independently. So, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Checkered-Brown: 3\n- Plain-Brown: 1\n\nAdding up to 16.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16, but the ratios are 8:4:0:4, which simplifies to 2:1:0:1, which doesn't fit the standard 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the distribution is uneven.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, but the phenotypes don't align with the expected 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16, but the distribution is 6:2:6:2, which is not 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16, but no specific pattern.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me reconsider:\n\nIf the question asks about the F1 generation, which consists of CcBb, then the phenotypes would be based on whether C and/or B are present.\n\n- C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Brown (since C is absent, it's plain)\n- C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nSo, phenotypes:\n\n1. Red-Brown (if both C and B are present)\n2. Red-Checkered (if C is present and B absent)\n3. Brown (if either C is absent OR B is absent?)\n\nWait, no: According to the rules, if C is absent, regardless of B, it's plain. If B is present, even without C, it's brown. So:\n\n- Red-Brown: C and B both present \u2192 1 case\n- Red-Checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 1 case\n- Brown: Either C absent OR B absent (but since C being absent makes it plain, while B alone makes it brown?) Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the phenotype is determined is:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Only C present \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Only B present \u2192 Brown\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nIn this case, the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1 case\n- Red-Checkered: 1 case\n- Brown: 1 case\n- Plain-Brown: 1 case\n\nWhich gives a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the original question intended the F2 generation, but my previous calculations didn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. Let me check the user's question again: \"For this cross... show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\" So F2.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross with two loci each showing two alleles (each dominant) would yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's adjust for dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the 9:3:3:1 already accounts for dominance. So, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But how do these correspond to the options?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the ratios aren't 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, but the order is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the user's initial setup.\n\nThe user provided an initial setup of gametes, including CB, cb, cB, cb, etc., but perhaps that's a distraction. The key is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant the F1 generation, which would have a phenotypic ratio of 2:2 (assuming equal presence of alleles), leading to 1:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the F2 ratio for the F2 generation, which is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options match this exact ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, but that would complicate things further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consult the options again. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the order is 5:3:2:6. This could correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red:5\n- Checkered brown:3\n- Plain red:2\n- Plain brown:6\n\nThis",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So, for each bird:\n\n- Pigment:\n  - C: red\n  - c: plain\n  \n- Body color:\n  - B: brown\n  - b: checkered\n\nSo the phenotype can be any combination of these, leading to four possible phenotypic categories: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to list four phenotypes directly. Instead, the options present specific counts for each phenotype. So perhaps the key is to calculate the number of each type in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n1. **Parental Crosses:**\n   - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\n2. **F1 Generation:**\n   - Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, F1 will be CcBb (the only possible genotype).\n\n3. **F1 Selfing:**\n   - F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes at 50% CB and 50% cb.\n   - Thus, F2 will have the following genotypes:\n     - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n     - 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n     - 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n     - 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n- C: dominant (Red)\n- c: recessive (Plain)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- B: dominant (Brown)\n- b: recessive (Checkered)\n\nEach bird will display the phenotype where both genes are dominant. So:\n\n- If C is present (so genotype like CC or Cc) AND B is present (so genotype like BB or Bb), then the bird is red-brown.\n- If C is present BUT B is not present (so genotype like CC or Cc but bb), then the bird is red-checkered.\n- If neither C nor B are present (cc bb), then the bird is plain-brown.\n- If C is not present BUT B is present (so bb but something else?), wait no: Actually, if C is absent, regardless of B, the bird is plain-color. Similarly, if B is absent, regardless of C, the bird is brown. But if both are absent, it's plain-brown.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at each bird's phenotype based on their alleles. For example:\n\nBird with genotype CC: C is present (C), B is present (B) \u2192 Red-Brown\nBird with genotype Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\nBird with genotype cc: C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain-Brown\nBird with genotype bb: C absent, B present \u2192 Brown (since bb has B recessive, but in terms of body color, it's brown because B is present as dominant? Wait, no: Wait, B is dominant, so bb would still express brown because B is dominant. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, B is dominant, so even if an organism is bb, it will express the dominant trait, which is brown. Because the presence of at least one dominant allele (B) expresses the dominant trait. Similarly, if C is present (C), it'll express red, otherwise plain. So:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment (C):\n  - C: presence \u2192 Red\n  - c: absence \u2192 Plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - B: presence \u2192 Brown\n  - b: absence \u2192 Checkered\nThus, for each bird:\n\n- CC BB: C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nWait, but this seems off. Let me re-express:\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele), and B is present (at least one B allele), phenotype is Red-Brown.\n- If C is present but B is absent, phenotype is Red-Checkered.\n- If neither C nor B is present, phenotype is Plain-Brown.\n- If B is present but C is absent, phenotype is Brown (but according to our rules, C being absent makes it Plain. Wait, no\u2014if C is absent, regardless of B, it's Plain, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, if an organism has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will exhibit the red color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it will be brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- Both C and B are present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Brown (because B is dominant, so even without C, it's brown.)\n\nWait, but according to the initial description, the plain color is determined by recessive allele c. So, if an animal has c, it's plain, regardless of B. So, for Pigment Color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 presence (Red)\n- c is recessive \u2192 absence (Plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Body Color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 presence (Brown)\n- b is recessive \u2192 absence (Checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So, each bird's phenotype can be categorized into four possibilities:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. B present, C absent \u2192 Brown (since C is absent, it's plain, but B is present, so brown)\n\nWait, but according to the rules, if C is absent, regardless of B, it's plain. And if B is present, even without C, it's brown. So, the fourth category is simply Brown.\n\nNow, applying this to each bird in the F2 generation:\n\nFrom earlier, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown)\n- 25% Cc (C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown)\n- 25% cc (C absent, B present \u2192 Plain-Brown)\n- 25% bb (C absent, B present \u2192 Brown)\n\nWait, but this doesn't add up because 25% +25% +25% +25% =100%, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown (phenotype 1: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Red-Checkered (phenotype 2: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, Cc bb)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Let me make a table:\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 same as above \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 same as above \u2192 Red-Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Red-Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Plain-Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, now, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red-Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-Brown: Case7 \u2192 1 case\n- Brown: Cases8,9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 4 : 2 : 1 : 2.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9, which matches the sum of squares (3^2 * 3^2 = 9).\n\nLooking at the answer options, option H says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nWait, that's not matching what I got. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Red-Brown: 4 instances\n- Red-Checkered: 2 instances\n- Plain-Brown: 1 instance\n- Brown: 2 instances\n\nTotal: 9\n\nSo the ratio is 4 : 2 : 1 : 2, which translates to:\n\n- Red-Brown: 4/9\n- Red-Checkered: 2/9\n- Plain-Brown: 1/9\n- Brown: 2/9\n\nLooking at the answer choices, I don't see a ratio of 4:2:1:2. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Total 16, which is more than 9.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Did I misinterpret the question? Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me double-check.\n\nThe question states: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nSo, I did the F2 analysis correctly, getting a ratio of 4:2:1:2. But the options don't include this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4, which sums to 16. That's too high.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 genotypes. Let me try another approach. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since each gene is determined by a separate locus, and the recessive alleles are different, the actual phenotypic ratio might differ.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross is indeed 9:3:3:1, but each class corresponds to different phenotypes. However, depending on the dominance hierarchy, some classes may combine. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is 4 (Red-Brown) + 2 (Red-Checkered) + 1 (Plain-Brown) + 2 (Brown) = 9, which is correct. So the ratio is 4:2:1:2, but that isn't among the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me recalculate the F1 phenotypes.\n\nF1 is all Cc BB and cb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. So, F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the dihybrid cross, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nWait, let me consider dominance. For each gene:\n\n- C is dominant (Red)\n- B is dominant (Brown)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations where each gene contributes to the phenotype. The 9:3:3:1 ratio applies to the total F2 population. Let's apply it:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 =16.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. All RR: 9 \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. All RB: 3 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. All BR: 3 \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n4. All BB: 1 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nBut wait, that's under the assumption that the dominance applies to each trait separately. Alternatively, the standard 9:3:3:1 applies where each trait is expressed independently. So, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Checkered-Brown: 3\n- Plain-Brown: 1\n\nAdding up to 16.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16, but the ratios are 8:4:0:4, which simplifies to 2:1:0:1, which doesn't fit the standard 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the distribution is uneven.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, but the phenotypes don't align with the expected 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16, but the distribution is 6:2:6:2, which is not 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16, but no specific pattern.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me reconsider:\n\nIf the question asks about the F1 generation, which consists of CcBb, then the phenotypes would be based on whether C and/or B are present.\n\n- C present, B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Brown (since C is absent, it's plain)\n- C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nSo, phenotypes:\n\n1. Red-Brown (if both C and B are present)\n2. Red-Checkered (if C is present and B absent)\n3. Brown (if either C is absent OR B is absent?)\n\nWait, no: According to the rules, if C is absent, regardless of B, it's plain. If B is present, even without C, it's brown. So:\n\n- Red-Brown: C and B both present \u2192 1 case\n- Red-Checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 1 case\n- Brown: Either C absent OR B absent (but since C being absent makes it plain, while B alone makes it brown?) Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the phenotype is determined is:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Only C present \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Only B present \u2192 Brown\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain-Brown\n\nIn this case, the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1 case\n- Red-Checkered: 1 case\n- Brown: 1 case\n- Plain-Brown: 1 case\n\nWhich gives a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the original question intended the F2 generation, but my previous calculations didn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. Let me check the user's question again: \"For this cross... show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\" So F2.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross with two loci each showing two alleles (each dominant) would yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's adjust for dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the 9:3:3:1 already accounts for dominance. So, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But how do these correspond to the options?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the ratios aren't 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, but the order is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the user's initial setup.\n\nThe user provided an initial setup of gametes, including CB, cb, cB, cb, etc., but perhaps that's a distraction. The key is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant the F1 generation, which would have a phenotypic ratio of 2:2 (assuming equal presence of alleles), leading to 1:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the F2 ratio for the F2 generation, which is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options match this exact ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, but that would complicate things further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consult the options again. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the order is 5:3:2:6. This could correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red:5\n- Checkered brown:3\n- Plain red:2\n- Plain brown:6\n\nThis",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since both genes determine different aspects, the phenotype depends on both traits.",
    "rollout": " Since both genes determine different aspects, the phenotype depends on both traits. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown Color (B): Checkered Red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Brown Color (b): Plain Red\n3. Pigment Plain (c) and Brown Color (B): Checkered Brown\n4. Pigment Plain (c) and Brown Color (b): Plain Brown\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of the genes. Since both parents contribute gametes that carry specific alleles, the F2 generation will follow Mendelian ratios. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Parent 1 (CC) contributes C\n- Parent 2 (cc) contributes c\nSo in F1 (Cc), the probability of C is 50%, c is 50%.\n\nFor the pigment color, since C is dominant, any bird with C will display red pigment. So the probability of having pigment red (C) is 50%, plain (c) is 50%.\n\nFor the body color (B/b):\n\nParent 1 (BB) contributes B\nParent 2 (bb) contributes b\nSo in F1 (Bb), the probability of B is 50%, b is 50%.\n\nSince B is dominant, any bird with B will display brown color. So the probability of brown (B) is 50%, checkered (b) is 50%.\n\nNow, the overall F2 phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Each trait is inherited independently, so the combined phenotype follows a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, leading to 4 possible phenotypic combinations. However, since both genes are affecting different traits, the actual number of phenotypes may vary, depending on whether the traits are assorting independently. In this case, since the genes are independent, each combination is possible, resulting in four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Pigment Red & Brown Color (Checkered Red)\n2. Pigment Red & Brown Color (Plain Red)\n3. Pigment Plain & Brown Color (Checkered Brown)\n4. Pigment Plain & Brown Color (Plain Brown)\n\nThe probabilities for each of these are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Since both traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Pigment Red (50%) * Brown Color (50%) = 25%\n- Pigment Red (50%) * Brown Color (50%) = 25% (Wait, this seems off. Actually, each trait is independent, so the probability of both traits being expressed is the product of their individual probabilities.)\n\nWait, no, better approach: each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nBut let's clarify:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- P(C) = 50% (Red)\n- P(c) = 50% (Plain)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- P(B) = 50% (Brown)\n- P(b) = 50% (Checkered)\n\nEach trait is independent, so the four phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (Red) AND B (Brown): Checkered Red\n2. C (Red) AND b (Checkered): Plain Red\n3. c (Plain) AND B (Brown): Checkered Brown\n4. c (Plain) AND b (Checkered): Plain Brown\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n1. C and B: P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n2. C and b: P(C) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n3. c and B: P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n4. c and b: P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 25% * 4 = 100%, which adds up correctly. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But looking back at the options given, none of them have a 25% ratio. Instead, some options have larger numbers like 6, 2, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the question expects us to consider the F2 generation without considering all possible phenotypic combinations, but rather the observed phenotypic ratios from the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Wait, but the question says \"F2 generation,\" so I must proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't align with the phrasing. Wait, let me re-examine the question:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, okay, so it's specifically about the F2 generation. So my previous analysis stands: each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer choices, option D has a 1:3:1:1 ratio, where checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 1, and plain brown is 3. That suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:1:3, implying that checkered red and plain red are each 1 part, while checkered brown and plain brown are each 3 parts. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that's not what was asked either. Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up F1 and F2 generations. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the F1 as a cross between two different parents, but that might complicate things further.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the parents are not both F1. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the squares generated by crossing CcBb with itself. As I thought earlier, the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). But the phenotypes would still be the same as before, with each phenotype occurring 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none of them match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option D: 1,3,1,3. So why would that be the case?\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the question regarding F2. Let me double-check. The question specifies F2, so perhaps I should look into how many birds would be in each phenotype category in the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that also isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. Let me see: the F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself (F2), the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- 25% CC (red, plain)\n- 50% Cc (red, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n\nWait, but that's different from what I initially thought. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would be:\n\n- For the C locus: C and c, each at 50%.\n- For the B locus: B and b, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Now, let's count the phenotypes:\n\n1. C (from CC, Cc, ...) and B (from BB, Bb, ...) \u2192 Checkered Red (25% + 25% + 25% = 75%)\n2. C (from CC, Cc, ...) and b (from bb) \u2192 Plain Red (25%)\n3. c (from cc) and B (from BB, Bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown (25% + 25% + 25% = 75%)\n4. c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So the phenotypic ratio is 75% Checkered Red : 25% Plain Red : 75% Checkered Brown : 25% Plain Brown, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. So checking the answer options, option D is 1,3,1,3, which corresponds to 1:3:1:3. But our calculation shows 3:1:3:1. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but the F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:1:3:1. Let me confirm:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 75%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 3:1:3:1 for Checkered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown. So the options don't include 3:1:3:1, but option D is 1:3:1:3. This seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that wouldn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me try calculating it again.\n\nIn F2, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Since each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratios are 3:1 for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combination of both traits. Dividing each component by the total sum (9+3+3+1=16), the simplified ratio is 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16, which is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer options match this exactly. However, looking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't seem right.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 This implies each phenotype is equally likely, which contradicts our earlier conclusion of 3:1:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the phenotypic expression without accounting for dominance properly, but that complicates things beyond the scope. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should re-express the F2 phenotypic ratio correctly. According to our calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1. To express this as options given, perhaps it's presented as 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. However, option D presents a 1:3:1:3 ratio, which could imply that the question is misrepresenting the scenario or perhaps I've misapplied the principles.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but the F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3:1:3:1. But the options don't include this ratio, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the observable phenotypes, ignoring the genetic makeup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the checkered vs plain and brown vs red phenotypes without considering the dominance ratios. For example, if the presence of the dominant allele results in the phenotype regardless of the other gene, then each trait would appear equally often, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not accurate because dominance affects the likelihood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up F1 and F2 generations. If the F1 were considered, and the question was about F1 phenotypes, then the ratio would be 2:2 for each trait, leading to 2:2:2:2, which reduces to 1:1:1:1. Again, this isn't among the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should revisit the initial question. The question asks about the F2 generation, showing the phenotypic ratio. From our earlier analysis, the F2 ratio should be 3:1:3:1, but the options don't include this. However, looking at option D: 1,3,1,3, which sums to 6 parts, whereas the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But perhaps the question is counting the number of birds, not the phenotypic counts, making the ratio 3:1:3:1. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but F1 is CcBb, whose phenotypic ratio is 3:1 for each gene, leading to 3:1:3:1. But again, none of the options match this. Option D is 1:3:1:3, which could correspond to the F1's 3:1:3:1 ratio if the question is considering the inverse, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that most closely matches the expected ratio based on standard Mendelian inheritance. Since the F2 generation should exhibit a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options don't provide this, perhaps the intended answer is option D: 1,3,1,3, suggesting that the dominant and recessive alleles are equally represented, even though mathematically, dominance affects the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the confusion, I'll choose option D: 1,3,1,3, as it's the most plausible given the options provided, possibly reflecting a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the expected ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since both genes determine different aspects, the phenotype depends on both traits. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown Color (B): Checkered Red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Brown Color (b): Plain Red\n3. Pigment Plain (c) and Brown Color (B): Checkered Brown\n4. Pigment Plain (c) and Brown Color (b): Plain Brown\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of the genes. Since both parents contribute gametes that carry specific alleles, the F2 generation will follow Mendelian ratios. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Parent 1 (CC) contributes C\n- Parent 2 (cc) contributes c\nSo in F1 (Cc), the probability of C is 50%, c is 50%.\n\nFor the pigment color, since C is dominant, any bird with C will display red pigment. So the probability of having pigment red (C) is 50%, plain (c) is 50%.\n\nFor the body color (B/b):\n\nParent 1 (BB) contributes B\nParent 2 (bb) contributes b\nSo in F1 (Bb), the probability of B is 50%, b is 50%.\n\nSince B is dominant, any bird with B will display brown color. So the probability of brown (B) is 50%, checkered (b) is 50%.\n\nNow, the overall F2 phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Each trait is inherited independently, so the combined phenotype follows a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, leading to 4 possible phenotypic combinations. However, since both genes are affecting different traits, the actual number of phenotypes may vary, depending on whether the traits are assorting independently. In this case, since the genes are independent, each combination is possible, resulting in four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Pigment Red & Brown Color (Checkered Red)\n2. Pigment Red & Brown Color (Plain Red)\n3. Pigment Plain & Brown Color (Checkered Brown)\n4. Pigment Plain & Brown Color (Plain Brown)\n\nThe probabilities for each of these are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Since both traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Pigment Red (50%) * Brown Color (50%) = 25%\n- Pigment Red (50%) * Brown Color (50%) = 25% (Wait, this seems off. Actually, each trait is independent, so the probability of both traits being expressed is the product of their individual probabilities.)\n\nWait, no, better approach: each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nBut let's clarify:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- P(C) = 50% (Red)\n- P(c) = 50% (Plain)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- P(B) = 50% (Brown)\n- P(b) = 50% (Checkered)\n\nEach trait is independent, so the four phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (Red) AND B (Brown): Checkered Red\n2. C (Red) AND b (Checkered): Plain Red\n3. c (Plain) AND B (Brown): Checkered Brown\n4. c (Plain) AND b (Checkered): Plain Brown\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n1. C and B: P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n2. C and b: P(C) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n3. c and B: P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n4. c and b: P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 25% * 4 = 100%, which adds up correctly. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But looking back at the options given, none of them have a 25% ratio. Instead, some options have larger numbers like 6, 2, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the question expects us to consider the F2 generation without considering all possible phenotypic combinations, but rather the observed phenotypic ratios from the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Wait, but the question says \"F2 generation,\" so I must proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't align with the phrasing. Wait, let me re-examine the question:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, okay, so it's specifically about the F2 generation. So my previous analysis stands: each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer choices, option D has a 1:3:1:1 ratio, where checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 1, and plain brown is 3. That suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:1:3, implying that checkered red and plain red are each 1 part, while checkered brown and plain brown are each 3 parts. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that's not what was asked either. Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up F1 and F2 generations. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the F1 as a cross between two different parents, but that might complicate things further.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the parents are not both F1. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the squares generated by crossing CcBb with itself. As I thought earlier, the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). But the phenotypes would still be the same as before, with each phenotype occurring 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none of them match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option D: 1,3,1,3. So why would that be the case?\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the question regarding F2. Let me double-check. The question specifies F2, so perhaps I should look into how many birds would be in each phenotype category in the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that also isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. Let me see: the F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself (F2), the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- 25% CC (red, plain)\n- 50% Cc (red, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n\nWait, but that's different from what I initially thought. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would be:\n\n- For the C locus: C and c, each at 50%.\n- For the B locus: B and b, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Now, let's count the phenotypes:\n\n1. C (from CC, Cc, ...) and B (from BB, Bb, ...) \u2192 Checkered Red (25% + 25% + 25% = 75%)\n2. C (from CC, Cc, ...) and b (from bb) \u2192 Plain Red (25%)\n3. c (from cc) and B (from BB, Bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown (25% + 25% + 25% = 75%)\n4. c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So the phenotypic ratio is 75% Checkered Red : 25% Plain Red : 75% Checkered Brown : 25% Plain Brown, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. So checking the answer options, option D is 1,3,1,3, which corresponds to 1:3:1:3. But our calculation shows 3:1:3:1. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but the F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:1:3:1. Let me confirm:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 75%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 3:1:3:1 for Checkered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown. So the options don't include 3:1:3:1, but option D is 1:3:1:3. This seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that wouldn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me try calculating it again.\n\nIn F2, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Since each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratios are 3:1 for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combination of both traits. Dividing each component by the total sum (9+3+3+1=16), the simplified ratio is 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16, which is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer options match this exactly. However, looking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't seem right.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 This implies each phenotype is equally likely, which contradicts our earlier conclusion of 3:1:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the phenotypic expression without accounting for dominance properly, but that complicates things beyond the scope. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should re-express the F2 phenotypic ratio correctly. According to our calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1. To express this as options given, perhaps it's presented as 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. However, option D presents a 1:3:1:3 ratio, which could imply that the question is misrepresenting the scenario or perhaps I've misapplied the principles.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but the F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3:1:3:1. But the options don't include this ratio, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the observable phenotypes, ignoring the genetic makeup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the checkered vs plain and brown vs red phenotypes without considering the dominance ratios. For example, if the presence of the dominant allele results in the phenotype regardless of the other gene, then each trait would appear equally often, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not accurate because dominance affects the likelihood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up F1 and F2 generations. If the F1 were considered, and the question was about F1 phenotypes, then the ratio would be 2:2 for each trait, leading to 2:2:2:2, which reduces to 1:1:1:1. Again, this isn't among the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should revisit the initial question. The question asks about the F2 generation, showing the phenotypic ratio. From our earlier analysis, the F2 ratio should be 3:1:3:1, but the options don't include this. However, looking at option D: 1,3,1,3, which sums to 6 parts, whereas the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But perhaps the question is counting the number of birds, not the phenotypic counts, making the ratio 3:1:3:1. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but F1 is CcBb, whose phenotypic ratio is 3:1 for each gene, leading to 3:1:3:1. But again, none of the options match this. Option D is 1:3:1:3, which could correspond to the F1's 3:1:3:1 ratio if the question is considering the inverse, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that most closely matches the expected ratio based on standard Mendelian inheritance. Since the F2 generation should exhibit a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options don't provide this, perhaps the intended answer is option D: 1,3,1,3, suggesting that the dominant and recessive alleles are equally represented, even though mathematically, dominance affects the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the confusion, I'll choose option D: 1,3,1,3, as it's the most plausible given the options provided, possibly reflecting a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the expected ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

    "rollout": " However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so let's consider how many of each phenotype appear in the F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question mentions checking for each bird whether it is \"checkered\" or \"plain\", and \"brown\" or \"red\". So each bird will have a phenotype based on both traits. But the question might be simplifying, asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the dominant alleles for each trait. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio based on the count of each phenotype type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes and then convert those into phenotypic counts. Let me proceed methodically.\n\nFirst, determine the F2 genotypes:\n\nThe F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself, resulting in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The correct gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at a 50% ratio. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB gamete: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CB + cb: CcBb\n- cb + CB: CcBb\n- cb + cb: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nBut since each gamete is equally likely, the probability of each genotype is 25%, except for the homozygotes, which have lower probabilities. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for each gene, then the F2 genotypes include:\n\nFor each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined F2 genotypes would have the product of these probabilities. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n2. CC Bb (25% \u00d7 50%) = 12.5%\n3. CC bb (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n4. Cc BB (50% \u00d7 25%) = 12.5%\n5. Cc Bb (50% \u00d7 50%) = 25%\n6. Cc bb (50% \u00d7 25%) = 12.5%\n7. cc BB (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n8. cc Bb (25% \u00d7 50%) = 12.5%\n9. cc bb (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes (assuming each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits) would correspond to the following:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b. Since the C and B traits are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be considered as the product of the individual ratios for each trait. Let's list each bird's phenotype:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is red-brown.\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is recessive (b_), then the bird is red-checkered.\n- If C is recessive (c_), and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is plain-brown.\n- If C is recessive (c_), and B is recessive (b_), then the bird is plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's compute the proportion of each phenotype in F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1: red-brown (C_B_)\n  - Probability: (probability C is dominant) \u00d7 (probability B is dominant) = (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25%\n  \n- Phenotype 2: red-checkered (C_b_)\n  - Probability: (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25% (since c is recessive)\n  \n- Phenotype 3: plain-brown (c_B_)\n  - Probability: (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25%\n  \n- Phenotype 4: plain-checkered (c_b_)\n  - Probability: (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%, but each phenotype seems to have 25% of the F2 population. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.\n\nWait, perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, so each bird could be classified into one of four phenotypes. However, the way the question is phrased suggests that each bird may belong to one of two phenotypic categories: either \"red\" or \"plain\" for pigment color, and either \"brown\" or \"red\" for body color. But that might complicate things further. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, regardless of the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Perhaps the user made a typo, but assuming the options are as above, let me try to calculate the correct F2 phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the C/B and c/b traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B_) \u2192 Both C is recessive (c) and B is dominant (B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b_) \u2192 Both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b)\n3. Plain red (C_b_) \u2192 C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b)\n4. Plain brown (C_B_) \u2192 C is dominant (C) and B is dominant (B)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n\n- Probability of being C_: 50% (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of being cc: 50%\n\nFor B (body):\n\n- Probability of being BB: 25%\n- Probability of being Bb: 50%\n- Probability of being bb: 25%\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B_):\n   - Probability C is cc: 50%\n   - Probability B is B_: 50%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\n2. Checkered brown (c_b_):\n   - Probability C is cc: 50%\n   - Probability B is bb: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\n3. Plain red (C_b_):\n   - Probability C is C_: 50%\n   - Probability B is bb: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\n4. Plain brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability C is C_: 50%\n   - Probability B is B_: 50%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nWait, but adding these up: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 75%, which doesn't make sense because F2 should account for all possible phenotypes. This indicates a miscalculation.\n\nAh, I realize now\u2014I misapplied the multiplication. Each trait is independent, so the correct calculation is:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. The probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (c_B_):\n   - Probability C is recessive (cc): 50% (since C is dominant, only cc remains)\n   - Probability B is dominant (B_): 50% (since B is dominant, only B_ remains)\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (c_b_):\n   - Probability C is recessive (cc): 50%\n   - Probability B is recessive (bb): 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (C_b_):\n   - Probability C is dominant (C_): 50%\n   - Probability B is recessive (bb): 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability C is dominant (C_): 50%\n   - Probability B is dominant (B_): 50%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nAdding these together: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 75% \u2192 Wait, that's impossible because F2 should cover all possibilities. I must have made a mistake in the way I'm assigning the percentages.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering each trait separately, recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: (c)(B)_ \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered brown: (c)(b)_ \u2192 25%\n3. Plain red: (C)(b)_ \u2192 25%\n4. Plain brown: (C)(B)_ \u2192 25%\n\nThis makes sense because each trait has two possible outcomes, leading to four phenotypic classes. Each class occurs with equal frequency in F2, assuming no dominance or incomplete dominance. Thus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equivalently, each phenotype appears 25% of the time.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect a 25% each. Instead, some options suggest different distributions. For example, option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, while option K sums to 20. Option L sums to 20 as well. Option M sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the calculations. In F2, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: c_B_\n2. Checkered brown: c_b_\n3. Plain red: C_b_\n4. Plain brown: C_B_\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both traits. Since each trait is determined independently, each of these four phenotypes should occur with equal frequency in F2.\n\nThus, each phenotype should have a 25% chance, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/4 of the F2 population\n- Checkered brown: 1/4\n- Plain red: 1/4\n- Plain brown: 1/4\n\nIf the entire F2 population is 16 (as seen in options A, D, E, G, H, I, J, K, N), each phenotype would appear 4 times. However, none of the answer options reflect a 25% distribution. The closest matching option is J, which states Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. Adding up to 12, which doesn't align. Option K sums to 20, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included multiple traits, but the options don't seem to represent the correct 25% distribution. Alternatively, maybe the question is counting the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance, treating each bird as having a distinct phenotype regardless of dominance.\n\nGiven that, let's recast the problem. Suppose each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of a dominant allele for each trait, irrespective of the other. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Both traits are dominant (Checkered red): 1 out of 4\n- One trait dominant, another recessive: 1 out of 4\n- Both traits recessive: 1 out of 4\n\nWhich again leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, totaling 4. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype based on the actual counts of the F2 individuals, considering dominance. If that's the case, let's calculate the actual numbers in F2.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- Number of each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: 25% \u2192 0.25 * 16 = 4 (if F2 population is 16)\n2. CC Bb: 25% \u2192 4\n3. CC bb: 25% \u2192 4\n4. Cc BB: 25% \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb: 25% \u2192 4\n6. Cc bb: 25% \u2192 4\n7. cc BB: 25% \u2192 4\n8. cc Bb: 25% \u2192 4\n9. cc bb: 25% \u2192 4\n\nTotal: 9 groups, each with 4 individuals, making 36. Wait, but this contradicts earlier calculations where each phenotype seemed to have 4 individuals. However, this approach treats each bird as unique regardless of phenotype, which isn't standard practice.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles, rather than the exact count. In that case, each bird contributes to the phenotype based on whether any dominant allele is present for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (C), it's red; otherwise, plain.\n- Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it's brown; otherwise, plain.\n\nApplying this logic, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B recessive): 1 bird\n2. Checkered brown (only B dominant): 1 bird\n3. Plain red (only C recessive): 1 bird\n4. Plain brown (only B recessive): 1 bird\n\nThis would mean a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't reflected in the options. Hence, perhaps the question is simplified, and each bird's phenotype is counted based on the presence of a dominant allele for each trait, leading to four phenotypes, each appearing once in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but this isn't among the answer options. Therefore, I must reconsider my approach.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question considers each bird's phenotype based on whether the dominant allele is present for at least one trait. That is, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment color and/or body color is classified as a certain phenotype, ignoring dominance within a trait. This would lead to four phenotypes, each represented by a single bird, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, none of the options reflect this. The closest option is J, which states Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1, but that adds up to 12, which doesn't align with the F2 population size. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, leading to four phenotypes each with equal representation.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the most logical answer based on typical Mendelian ratios. Since each trait is independently controlled and follows a 1:1:1:1 ratio in F2, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't an option. \n\nLooking at the options, option J suggests a ratio of 2:6:3:1, which adds up to 12. Option K sums to 20. None of them seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of at least one dominant allele, but without considering dominance within a trait. In that case, each bird would fall into one of four phenotypes, each with equal frequency, leading to a ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so let's consider how many of each phenotype appear in the F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question mentions checking for each bird whether it is \"checkered\" or \"plain\", and \"brown\" or \"red\". So each bird will have a phenotype based on both traits. But the question might be simplifying, asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the dominant alleles for each trait. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio based on the count of each phenotype type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes and then convert those into phenotypic counts. Let me proceed methodically.\n\nFirst, determine the F2 genotypes:\n\nThe F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself, resulting in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The correct gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at a 50% ratio. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB gamete: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CB + cb: CcBb\n- cb + CB: CcBb\n- cb + cb: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nBut since each gamete is equally likely, the probability of each genotype is 25%, except for the homozygotes, which have lower probabilities. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for each gene, then the F2 genotypes include:\n\nFor each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined F2 genotypes would have the product of these probabilities. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n2. CC Bb (25% \u00d7 50%) = 12.5%\n3. CC bb (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n4. Cc BB (50% \u00d7 25%) = 12.5%\n5. Cc Bb (50% \u00d7 50%) = 25%\n6. Cc bb (50% \u00d7 25%) = 12.5%\n7. cc BB (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n8. cc Bb (25% \u00d7 50%) = 12.5%\n9. cc bb (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes (assuming each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits) would correspond to the following:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both C/B and c/b. Since the C and B traits are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be considered as the product of the individual ratios for each trait. Let's list each bird's phenotype:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is red-brown.\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is recessive (b_), then the bird is red-checkered.\n- If C is recessive (c_), and B is dominant (B_), then the bird is plain-brown.\n- If C is recessive (c_), and B is recessive (b_), then the bird is plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's compute the proportion of each phenotype in F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1: red-brown (C_B_)\n  - Probability: (probability C is dominant) \u00d7 (probability B is dominant) = (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25%\n  \n- Phenotype 2: red-checkered (C_b_)\n  - Probability: (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25% (since c is recessive)\n  \n- Phenotype 3: plain-brown (c_B_)\n  - Probability: (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25%\n  \n- Phenotype 4: plain-checkered (c_b_)\n  - Probability: (50%) \u00d7 (50%) = 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%, but each phenotype seems to have 25% of the F2 population. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.\n\nWait, perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, so each bird could be classified into one of four phenotypes. However, the way the question is phrased suggests that each bird may belong to one of two phenotypic categories: either \"red\" or \"plain\" for pigment color, and either \"brown\" or \"red\" for body color. But that might complicate things further. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, regardless of the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The question says: \"checkered red\" and others. Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA.

Perhaps the user made a typo, but assuming the options are as above, let me try to calculate the correct F2 phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the C/B and c/b traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B_) \u2192 Both C is recessive (c) and B is dominant (B)\n2. Checkered brown (c_b_) \u2192 Both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b)\n3. Plain red (C_b_) \u2192 C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b)\n4. Plain brown (C_B_) \u2192 C is dominant (C) and B is dominant (B)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n\n- Probability of being C_: 50% (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of being cc: 50%\n\nFor B (body):\n\n- Probability of being BB: 25%\n- Probability of being Bb: 50%\n- Probability of being bb: 25%\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\n1. Checkered red (c_B_):\n   - Probability C is cc: 50%\n   - Probability B is B_: 50%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\n2. Checkered brown (c_b_):\n   - Probability C is cc: 50%\n   - Probability B is bb: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\n3. Plain red (C_b_):\n   - Probability C is C_: 50%\n   - Probability B is bb: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\n4. Plain brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability C is C_: 50%\n   - Probability B is B_: 50%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nWait, but adding these up: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 75%, which doesn't make sense because F2 should account for all possible phenotypes. This indicates a miscalculation.\n\nAh, I realize now\u2014I misapplied the multiplication. Each trait is independent, so the correct calculation is:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. The probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (c_B_):\n   - Probability C is recessive (cc): 50% (since C is dominant, only cc remains)\n   - Probability B is dominant (B_): 50% (since B is dominant, only B_ remains)\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (c_b_):\n   - Probability C is recessive (cc): 50%\n   - Probability B is recessive (bb): 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (C_b_):\n   - Probability C is dominant (C_): 50%\n   - Probability B is recessive (bb): 25%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.25 = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability C is dominant (C_): 50%\n   - Probability B is dominant (B_): 50%\n   - Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nAdding these together: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 75% \u2192 Wait, that's impossible because F2 should cover all possibilities. I must have made a mistake in the way I'm assigning the percentages.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering each trait separately, recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: (c)(B)_ \u2192 25%\n2. Checkered brown: (c)(b)_ \u2192 25%\n3. Plain red: (C)(b)_ \u2192 25%\n4. Plain brown: (C)(B)_ \u2192 25%\n\nThis makes sense because each trait has two possible outcomes, leading to four phenotypic classes. Each class occurs with equal frequency in F2, assuming no dominance or incomplete dominance. Thus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equivalently, each phenotype appears 25% of the time.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect a 25% each. Instead, some options suggest different distributions. For example, option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, while option K sums to 20. Option L sums to 20 as well. Option M sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the calculations. In F2, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: c_B_\n2. Checkered brown: c_b_\n3. Plain red: C_b_\n4. Plain brown: C_B_\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both traits. Since each trait is determined independently, each of these four phenotypes should occur with equal frequency in F2.\n\nThus, each phenotype should have a 25% chance, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/4 of the F2 population\n- Checkered brown: 1/4\n- Plain red: 1/4\n- Plain brown: 1/4\n\nIf the entire F2 population is 16 (as seen in options A, D, E, G, H, I, J, K, N), each phenotype would appear 4 times. However, none of the answer options reflect a 25% distribution. The closest matching option is J, which states Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. Adding up to 12, which doesn't align. Option K sums to 20, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included multiple traits, but the options don't seem to represent the correct 25% distribution. Alternatively, maybe the question is counting the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance, treating each bird as having a distinct phenotype regardless of dominance.\n\nGiven that, let's recast the problem. Suppose each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of a dominant allele for each trait, irrespective of the other. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Both traits are dominant (Checkered red): 1 out of 4\n- One trait dominant, another recessive: 1 out of 4\n- Both traits recessive: 1 out of 4\n\nWhich again leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, totaling 4. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype based on the actual counts of the F2 individuals, considering dominance. If that's the case, let's calculate the actual numbers in F2.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- Number of each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: 25% \u2192 0.25 * 16 = 4 (if F2 population is 16)\n2. CC Bb: 25% \u2192 4\n3. CC bb: 25% \u2192 4\n4. Cc BB: 25% \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb: 25% \u2192 4\n6. Cc bb: 25% \u2192 4\n7. cc BB: 25% \u2192 4\n8. cc Bb: 25% \u2192 4\n9. cc bb: 25% \u2192 4\n\nTotal: 9 groups, each with 4 individuals, making 36. Wait, but this contradicts earlier calculations where each phenotype seemed to have 4 individuals. However, this approach treats each bird as unique regardless of phenotype, which isn't standard practice.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles, rather than the exact count. In that case, each bird contributes to the phenotype based on whether any dominant allele is present for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (C), it's red; otherwise, plain.\n- Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it's brown; otherwise, plain.\n\nApplying this logic, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B recessive): 1 bird\n2. Checkered brown (only B dominant): 1 bird\n3. Plain red (only C recessive): 1 bird\n4. Plain brown (only B recessive): 1 bird\n\nThis would mean a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't reflected in the options. Hence, perhaps the question is simplified, and each bird's phenotype is counted based on the presence of a dominant allele for each trait, leading to four phenotypes, each appearing once in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but this isn't among the answer options. Therefore, I must reconsider my approach.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question considers each bird's phenotype based on whether the dominant allele is present for at least one trait. That is, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment color and/or body color is classified as a certain phenotype, ignoring dominance within a trait. This would lead to four phenotypes, each represented by a single bird, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, none of the options reflect this. The closest option is J, which states Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1, but that adds up to 12, which doesn't align with the F2 population size. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, leading to four phenotypes each with equal representation.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the most logical answer based on typical Mendelian ratios. Since each trait is independently controlled and follows a 1:1:1:1 ratio in F2, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't an option. \n\nLooking at the options, option J suggests a ratio of 2:6:3:1, which adds up to 12. Option K sums to 20. None of them seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of at least one dominant allele, but without considering dominance within a trait. In that case, each bird would fall into one of four phenotypes, each with equal frequency, leading to a ",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotypes would be:",
    "rollout": " So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate them.\n\nFirst, for pigment color (C/c):\n\n- C_: 2/3 (since parents are CC and cc, the F1 is Cc, so F2 has 2/3 C and 1/3 c)\n\nWait, actually, the F1 is Cc, right? Because the F1 of CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs, so for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 2/3\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/3\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 2/3\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probabilities.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant: (C and B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: (C and b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: (c and B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: (c and b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n1. P(C) * P(B) = (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.4%\n2. P(C) * P(b) = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n3. P(c) * P(B) = (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n4. P(c) * P(b) = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.1%\n\nWait, but adding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is approximately 4:2:2:1, translating to checkered red : plain red : checkered brown : plain brown.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this exact ratio. Let's see the options:\n\nLooking at option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, close but not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: The F2 generation will have 9 possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 9 x 9 = 81 possible phenotypic combinations, but many will overlap. Alternatively, since each gene has three possible phenotypes, the actual phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1, but considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. With dominance, the phenotypes are not equally probable. Instead, the phenotypic ratios are based on the additive probabilities. So my earlier calculation seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of each type without considering dominance, treating each gene separately. If that's the case, then:\n\nEach gene contributes to the phenotype, so for pigment color, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C): 2/3\n- Plain (c): 1/3\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Brown (B): 2/3\n- Checkered (b): 1/3\n\nThus, the overall phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both dominant: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment dominant, body recessive: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment recessive, body dominant: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Both recessive: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWhich translates to a 4:2:2:1 ratio, or simplified as 4 parts checkered red, 2 parts plain red, 2 parts checkered brown, and 1 part plain brown. However, looking at the answer options, none seem to exactly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16, which doesn't add up.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16, same issue.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 12.\n\nHmm, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me try a different approach: Using the Punnett square as presented in the question, where the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and Body red (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc: Pigment plain (c) and Body red (B) \u2192 Plain red\n- bb: Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo now, calculating the frequency:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (25%) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain red\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 25% : 25% : 25% : 25% \u2192 1:1:1:1\n\nBut the answer options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. They all have combinations like 6,2, etc. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Perhaps it's asking about the ratio after considering only the dominant phenotypes, ignoring the recessive ones. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16. Not sure how that comes from 9.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16.\n\nNone of these sum to 16. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the basics.\n\nIn F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio when considering dominance is 1:1:1:1. However, in reality, the phenotypes are grouped into categories based on dominant traits. So, each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nIf we treat each trait independently, the phenotypic ratio becomes 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none provide this exact ratio. The closest is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Ratio 5:3:2:6. This adds up to 16, which isn't 1:1:1:1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Let me check what the F1 looks like. The F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the question is about the F2. So perhaps I need to compute the F2 ratios correctly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB + CB)\n- Cc: 25% (from CB + cb)\n- cc: 25% (from cb + cb)\n- bb: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, so 1:1:1:1. But the answer options don't reflect this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nM. 2,6,6,6 \u2192 20\n\nN. 1,1,1,1 \u2192 4\n\nO. 3,3,3,3 \u2192 12\n\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nQ. 5,5,5,5 \u2192 20\n\nR. 6,6,6,6 \u2192 24\n\nS. 7,7,7,7 \u2192 28\n\nT. 8,8,8,8 \u2192 32\n\nU. 9,9,9,9 \u2192 36\n\nV. 10,10,10,10 \u2192 40\n\nW. 11,11,11,11 \u2192 44\n\nX. 12,12,12,12 \u2192 48\n\nY. 13,13,13,13 \u2192 52\n\nZ. 14,14,14,14 \u2192 56\n\nWait, none of these options have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest is option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. How does that come?\n\nLet me recalculate the F2 ratio properly. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none match this exactly. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 rather than F2. Let me check what the F1 phenotypic ratio is.\n\nF1 is CcBb, so:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 ratio is 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The user wrote:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nBut the user also showed a Punnett square for F\u2081 \u00d7 F\u2081, which results in F\u2082. However, upon closer inspection, the options provided do not align with the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 phenotypes, but mistakenly included F2. Alternatively, perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed under the assumption that the question is asking about the F\u2082 phenotypic ratio. According to standard Mendelian inheritance, with dominant genes, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided do not include this, suggesting a possible error in the options or in the question itself.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16. This could arise from a different calculation method, such as considering only certain phenotypes beyond dominance, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this either.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make an educated guess based on the most plausible interpretation. If the question is about the F\u2082 phenotypic ratio, despite the lack of a perfect match in the options, option H seems to have the largest numbers, possibly indicating more checkered phenotypes, which might occur due to more dominant alleles.\n\nHowever, based on standard Mendelian genetics, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Since this isn't among the options, perhaps the correct choice is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate them.\n\nFirst, for pigment color (C/c):\n\n- C_: 2/3 (since parents are CC and cc, the F1 is Cc, so F2 has 2/3 C and 1/3 c)\n\nWait, actually, the F1 is Cc, right? Because the F1 of CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs, so for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 2/3\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/3\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 2/3\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probabilities.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant: (C and B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: (C and b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: (c and B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: (c and b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n1. P(C) * P(B) = (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.4%\n2. P(C) * P(b) = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n3. P(c) * P(B) = (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n4. P(c) * P(b) = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.1%\n\nWait, but adding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is approximately 4:2:2:1, translating to checkered red : plain red : checkered brown : plain brown.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this exact ratio. Let's see the options:\n\nLooking at option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, close but not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: The F2 generation will have 9 possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 9 x 9 = 81 possible phenotypic combinations, but many will overlap. Alternatively, since each gene has three possible phenotypes, the actual phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1, but considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. With dominance, the phenotypes are not equally probable. Instead, the phenotypic ratios are based on the additive probabilities. So my earlier calculation seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of each type without considering dominance, treating each gene separately. If that's the case, then:\n\nEach gene contributes to the phenotype, so for pigment color, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C): 2/3\n- Plain (c): 1/3\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Brown (B): 2/3\n- Checkered (b): 1/3\n\nThus, the overall phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both dominant: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment dominant, body recessive: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment recessive, body dominant: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Both recessive: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWhich translates to a 4:2:2:1 ratio, or simplified as 4 parts checkered red, 2 parts plain red, 2 parts checkered brown, and 1 part plain brown. However, looking at the answer options, none seem to exactly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16, which doesn't add up.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16, same issue.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 12.\n\nHmm, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me try a different approach: Using the Punnett square as presented in the question, where the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and Body red (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and Body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc: Pigment plain (c) and Body red (B) \u2192 Plain red\n- bb: Pigment plain (c) and Body brown (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo now, calculating the frequency:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (25%) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain red\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 25% : 25% : 25% : 25% \u2192 1:1:1:1\n\nBut the answer options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. They all have combinations like 6,2, etc. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Perhaps it's asking about the ratio after considering only the dominant phenotypes, ignoring the recessive ones. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16. Not sure how that comes from 9.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16.\n\nNone of these sum to 16. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the basics.\n\nIn F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio when considering dominance is 1:1:1:1. However, in reality, the phenotypes are grouped into categories based on dominant traits. So, each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nIf we treat each trait independently, the phenotypic ratio becomes 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none provide this exact ratio. The closest is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Ratio 5:3:2:6. This adds up to 16, which isn't 1:1:1:1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Let me check what the F1 looks like. The F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the question is about the F2. So perhaps I need to compute the F2 ratios correctly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB + CB)\n- Cc: 25% (from CB + cb)\n- cc: 25% (from cb + cb)\n- bb: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, so 1:1:1:1. But the answer options don't reflect this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nM. 2,6,6,6 \u2192 20\n\nN. 1,1,1,1 \u2192 4\n\nO. 3,3,3,3 \u2192 12\n\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nQ. 5,5,5,5 \u2192 20\n\nR. 6,6,6,6 \u2192 24\n\nS. 7,7,7,7 \u2192 28\n\nT. 8,8,8,8 \u2192 32\n\nU. 9,9,9,9 \u2192 36\n\nV. 10,10,10,10 \u2192 40\n\nW. 11,11,11,11 \u2192 44\n\nX. 12,12,12,12 \u2192 48\n\nY. 13,13,13,13 \u2192 52\n\nZ. 14,14,14,14 \u2192 56\n\nWait, none of these options have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest is option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16. How does that come?\n\nLet me recalculate the F2 ratio properly. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none match this exactly. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 rather than F2. Let me check what the F1 phenotypic ratio is.\n\nF1 is CcBb, so:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 ratio is 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The user wrote:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nBut the user also showed a Punnett square for F\u2081 \u00d7 F\u2081, which results in F\u2082. However, upon closer inspection, the options provided do not align with the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 phenotypes, but mistakenly included F2. Alternatively, perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed under the assumption that the question is asking about the F\u2082 phenotypic ratio. According to standard Mendelian inheritance, with dominant genes, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided do not include this, suggesting a possible error in the options or in the question itself.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16. This could arise from a different calculation method, such as considering only certain phenotypes beyond dominance, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this either.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make an educated guess based on the most plausible interpretation. If the question is about the F\u2082 phenotypic ratio, despite the lack of a perfect match in the options, option H seems to have the largest numbers, possibly indicating more checkered phenotypes, which might occur due to more dominant alleles.\n\nHowever, based on standard Mendelian genetics, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Since this isn't among the options, perhaps the correct choice is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

    "rollout": " So the number of possible phenotypes is 2 x 2 = 4. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.

Both traits are present (Red Brown):\n   - P(C) = 3/4 (since C can be present in any combination except cc)\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because each bird's color is determined by the alleles for each gene separately. So the actual calculation should consider each gene independently. Let's approach it differently:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have the dominant allele for each gene. So for pigment color (C), the bird has either C or c.

Pigment Plain (c_), Body Checkered (b_)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for Pigment Red (C_):\n\nProbability = 1 - P(c) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSimilarly, for Pigment Plain (c_):\nProbability = 1/4\n\nBut wait, that's only considering the C locus. However, the presence of the B locus also affects the phenotype. So we need to combine both loci.\n\nFor Pigment Red (C_) and Body Brown (B_):\nProbability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nFor Pigment Red (C_) and Body Checkered (b_):\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Pigment Plain (c_) and Body Brown (B_):\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Pigment Plain (c_) and Body Checkered (b_):\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options given, some have different ratios. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the probabilities. Each gene has a certain probability of being present, but the actual phenotypic ratios depend on the combination of both genes. Alternatively, since each bird is determined by two independent traits, the number of phenotypes is indeed four, but the ratios aren't necessarily 9:3:3:1 unless both genes are acting independently without epistasis. In this case, it seems that the genes are acting independently, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 3:1:3:1 scaled up.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 scaled.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's see. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers to the c locus. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered (b_): pigment is plain (c_).\n- Plain (c_): pigment is red.\n- Brown (B_): body is brown.\n- Checkered (b_): body is checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: b_ and c_, i.e., both traits are present.\n2. Checkered brown: b_ and B_.\n3. Plain red: c_ and c_, i.e., pigment is plain but body is brown.\n4. Plain brown: c_ and B_.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red (b_ and c_):\n   P(b_) = 1/4\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (b_ and B_):\n   P(b_) = 1/4\n   P(B_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain red (c_ and c_):\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n4. Plain brown (c_ and B_):\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   P(B_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 + 9/16 = 24/16 = 1.5, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the combined probabilities.\n\nAh, I realize now. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The correct way to calculate the probabilities is by considering all possible combinations of the two genes. Since each gene is independent, the total phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately and then combined. But I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, and the options provided don't align perfectly with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps I need to re-examine the initial assumption. Wait, perhaps the genotypes correspond directly to the phenotypes, so the phenotypic ratio can be derived from the number of each genotype.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC bb: red plain\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's clarify:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, each bird has two copies of each gene, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (homozygous dominant for both)\n- CC Bb (dominant pigment, recessive body)\n- CC bb (dominant pigment, recessive body)\n- CC bb (same as above)\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n- 25% bb BB\n- 25% bb Bb\n- 25% bb bb\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird has two copies, so the actual combinations are:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/4 CC Bb\n- 1/4 CC bb\n- 1/4 cc BB\n- 1/4 cc Bb\n- 1/4 cc bb\n- 1/4 bb BB\n- 1/4 bb Bb\n- 1/4 bb bb\n\nBut that's nine possible genotypes, each occurring once in the F2 generation. However, in reality, some genotypes may not occur due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but assuming complete dominance, each genotype does occur.\n\nNow, mapping these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC Bb: red checkered (since B is dominant)\n- CC bb: red plain\n- CC bb: same as above\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc Bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- bb BB: same as cc BB\n- bb Bb: same as cc Bb\n- bb bb: same as cc bb\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red checkered: 2 (from CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Red plain: 2 (from CC bb and CC bb)\n- Plain checkered: 5 (from cc BB, cc Bb, bb BB, bb Bb, bb bb)\nWait, no\u2014that counts incorrectly. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC Bb: red checkered\n- CC bb: red plain\n- CC bb: red plain\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc Bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- bb BB: same as cc BB\n- bb Bb: same as cc Bb\n- bb bb: same as cc bb\n\nSo the count is:\n\n- Red checkered: 2\n- Red plain: 2\n- Plain checkered: 5\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nThat totals to 9, which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the answer choices, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which sums to 16, which is twice what we have. Option E says 3,9,1,3, summing to 16, which is also twice. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the genotypes with the phenotypes. Let's re-express the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes properly.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC Bb: red checkered\n- CC bb: red plain\n- CC bb: red plain\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc Bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- bb BB: same as cc BB\n- bb Bb: same as cc Bb\n- bb bb: same as cc bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red checkered: 2 (from CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Red plain: 2 (from CC bb and CC bb)\n- Plain checkered: 5 (from cc BB, cc Bb, bb BB, bb Bb, bb bb)\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nThis adds up to 9, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking back at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is wrong.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 10.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 20.\n\nWait, none of them exactly match. Perhaps I've misunderstood the question regarding the phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio after considering the phenotypes based on the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we look at the F1 (CcBb), the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_: pigment red\n- B_: body brown\n- Checkered: C_ and c_. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is C_ (pigment red), regardless of the body color, it would still be red. Similarly, if it's c_ (pigment plain), regardless of body color, it would be plain. So the phenotypes based solely on pigment color would be:\n\n- Pigment red: C_\n- Pigment plain: c_\n\nAnd body color is determined by B_ (brown) or b_ (checkered). So the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown: 25%\n2. Pigment red and body checkered: 25%\n3. Pigment plain and body brown: 25%\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered: 25%\n\nWhich again sums to 9:3:3:1. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that were the case, then the F1 phenotypes would be 25% for each combination. But the options don't include 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's go back to the initial problem statement.\n\nThe question states: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents. The first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the second is a plain brown bird (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb. The F2 would be the cross of F1 with F1. That part I did earlier, resulting in the F2 genotypes and phenotypes as discussed before, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which is 16 total, which is inconsistent with the 9:3:3:1. Option E suggests 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 as well. Option H mentions checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which sums to 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 (sum 16). None seem to align with the 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the roles of the genes. Let me confirm the phenotypes again.\n\nWait, the genes are:\n\n- C: pigment color (C = red, c = plain)\n- B: body color (B = brown, b = checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) & Body brown (B_) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C_) & Body checkered (b_) \u2192 25%\n3. Pigment plain (c_) & Body brown (B_) \u2192 25%\n4. Pigment plain (c_) & Body checkered (b_) \u2192 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But the options provided do not include this. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering only one gene, but that doesn't make sense given the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question and it's not asking for the F2 ratio but something else. Wait, the original question says: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So it's definitely F2.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the options are scaling up the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, which is double. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u219216. Option A:6,2,6,2\u219216. Option I:7,5,1,3\u219216.\n\nNone of these exactly match 9:3:3:1. However, perhaps the question is considering the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore dominance and consider all possible combinations equally likely, which would lead to a 16:4:4:1 ratio, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering only one gene. But that doesn't make sense because the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only considering the pigment color, ignoring the body color. If that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, treating the checkered and plain colors as separate, but that complicates things further.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to reevaluate my initial approach. Let me create a Punnett square for F2 based on the F1 (CcBb).\n\nThe F1 can produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (assuming F1 is CcBb). Wait, no, CcBb means each parent can",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the number of possible phenotypes is 2 x 2 = 4. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes. Now, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n- Presence (C): dominant (red)\n- Absence (c): recessive (plain)\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSince each gene acts independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities:\n\n1. Both traits are present (Red Brown):\n   - P(C) = 3/4 (since C can be present in any combination except cc)\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because each bird's color is determined by the alleles for each gene separately. So the actual calculation should consider each gene independently. Let's approach it differently:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have the dominant allele for each gene. So for pigment color (C), the bird has either C or c. Similarly, for body color (B), the bird has either B or b.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C_), Body Brown (B_)\n2. Pigment Red (C_), Body Checkered (b_)\n3. Pigment Plain (c_), Body Brown (B_)\n4. Pigment Plain (c_), Body Checkered (b_)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for Pigment Red (C_):\n\nProbability = 1 - P(c) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSimilarly, for Pigment Plain (c_):\nProbability = 1/4\n\nBut wait, that's only considering the C locus. However, the presence of the B locus also affects the phenotype. So we need to combine both loci.\n\nFor Pigment Red (C_) and Body Brown (B_):\nProbability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nFor Pigment Red (C_) and Body Checkered (b_):\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Pigment Plain (c_) and Body Brown (B_):\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Pigment Plain (c_) and Body Checkered (b_):\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options given, some have different ratios. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the probabilities. Each gene has a certain probability of being present, but the actual phenotypic ratios depend on the combination of both genes. Alternatively, since each bird is determined by two independent traits, the number of phenotypes is indeed four, but the ratios aren't necessarily 9:3:3:1 unless both genes are acting independently without epistasis. In this case, it seems that the genes are acting independently, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 3:1:3:1 scaled up.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 scaled.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's see. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers to the c locus. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered (b_): pigment is plain (c_).\n- Plain (c_): pigment is red.\n- Brown (B_): body is brown.\n- Checkered (b_): body is checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: b_ and c_, i.e., both traits are present.\n2. Checkered brown: b_ and B_.\n3. Plain red: c_ and c_, i.e., pigment is plain but body is brown.\n4. Plain brown: c_ and B_.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red (b_ and c_):\n   P(b_) = 1/4\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (b_ and B_):\n   P(b_) = 1/4\n   P(B_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain red (c_ and c_):\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n4. Plain brown (c_ and B_):\n   P(c_) = 3/4\n   P(B_) = 3/4\n   Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 + 9/16 = 24/16 = 1.5, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the combined probabilities.\n\nAh, I realize now. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The correct way to calculate the probabilities is by considering all possible combinations of the two genes. Since each gene is independent, the total phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately and then combined. But I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, and the options provided don't align perfectly with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps I need to re-examine the initial assumption. Wait, perhaps the genotypes correspond directly to the phenotypes, so the phenotypic ratio can be derived from the number of each genotype.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC bb: red plain\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's clarify:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, each bird has two copies of each gene, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (homozygous dominant for both)\n- CC Bb (dominant pigment, recessive body)\n- CC bb (dominant pigment, recessive body)\n- CC bb (same as above)\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n- 25% bb BB\n- 25% bb Bb\n- 25% bb bb\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird has two copies, so the actual combinations are:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/4 CC Bb\n- 1/4 CC bb\n- 1/4 cc BB\n- 1/4 cc Bb\n- 1/4 cc bb\n- 1/4 bb BB\n- 1/4 bb Bb\n- 1/4 bb bb\n\nBut that's nine possible genotypes, each occurring once in the F2 generation. However, in reality, some genotypes may not occur due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but assuming complete dominance, each genotype does occur.\n\nNow, mapping these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC Bb: red checkered (since B is dominant)\n- CC bb: red plain\n- CC bb: same as above\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc Bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- bb BB: same as cc BB\n- bb Bb: same as cc Bb\n- bb bb: same as cc bb\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red checkered: 2 (from CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Red plain: 2 (from CC bb and CC bb)\n- Plain checkered: 5 (from cc BB, cc Bb, bb BB, bb Bb, bb bb)\nWait, no\u2014that counts incorrectly. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC Bb: red checkered\n- CC bb: red plain\n- CC bb: red plain\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc Bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- bb BB: same as cc BB\n- bb Bb: same as cc Bb\n- bb bb: same as cc bb\n\nSo the count is:\n\n- Red checkered: 2\n- Red plain: 2\n- Plain checkered: 5\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nThat totals to 9, which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the answer choices, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which sums to 16, which is twice what we have. Option E says 3,9,1,3, summing to 16, which is also twice. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the genotypes with the phenotypes. Let's re-express the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes properly.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered\n- CC Bb: red checkered\n- CC bb: red plain\n- CC bb: red plain\n- cc BB: plain checkered\n- cc Bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- cc bb: plain checkered\n- bb BB: same as cc BB\n- bb Bb: same as cc Bb\n- bb bb: same as cc bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red checkered: 2 (from CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Red plain: 2 (from CC bb and CC bb)\n- Plain checkered: 5 (from cc BB, cc Bb, bb BB, bb Bb, bb bb)\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nThis adds up to 9, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking back at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is wrong.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 10.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 20.\n\nWait, none of them exactly match. Perhaps I've misunderstood the question regarding the phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio after considering the phenotypes based on the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf we look at the F1 (CcBb), the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_: pigment red\n- B_: body brown\n- Checkered: C_ and c_. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is C_ (pigment red), regardless of the body color, it would still be red. Similarly, if it's c_ (pigment plain), regardless of body color, it would be plain. So the phenotypes based solely on pigment color would be:\n\n- Pigment red: C_\n- Pigment plain: c_\n\nAnd body color is determined by B_ (brown) or b_ (checkered). So the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown: 25%\n2. Pigment red and body checkered: 25%\n3. Pigment plain and body brown: 25%\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered: 25%\n\nWhich again sums to 9:3:3:1. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that were the case, then the F1 phenotypes would be 25% for each combination. But the options don't include 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's go back to the initial problem statement.\n\nThe question states: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents. The first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the second is a plain brown bird (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb. The F2 would be the cross of F1 with F1. That part I did earlier, resulting in the F2 genotypes and phenotypes as discussed before, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which is 16 total, which is inconsistent with the 9:3:3:1. Option E suggests 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 as well. Option H mentions checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which sums to 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 (sum 16). None seem to align with the 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the roles of the genes. Let me confirm the phenotypes again.\n\nWait, the genes are:\n\n- C: pigment color (C = red, c = plain)\n- B: body color (B = brown, b = checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) & Body brown (B_) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C_) & Body checkered (b_) \u2192 25%\n3. Pigment plain (c_) & Body brown (B_) \u2192 25%\n4. Pigment plain (c_) & Body checkered (b_) \u2192 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But the options provided do not include this. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering only one gene, but that doesn't make sense given the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question and it's not asking for the F2 ratio but something else. Wait, the original question says: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So it's definitely F2.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the options are scaling up the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, which is double. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u219216. Option A:6,2,6,2\u219216. Option I:7,5,1,3\u219216.\n\nNone of these exactly match 9:3:3:1. However, perhaps the question is considering the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore dominance and consider all possible combinations equally likely, which would lead to a 16:4:4:1 ratio, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering only one gene. But that doesn't make sense because the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only considering the pigment color, ignoring the body color. If that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, treating the checkered and plain colors as separate, but that complicates things further.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to reevaluate my initial approach. Let me create a Punnett square for F2 based on the F1 (CcBb).\n\nThe F1 can produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (assuming F1 is CcBb). Wait, no, CcBb means each parent can",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

The F2 is the result of a selfing of F1 (CcBb). So the F1 can produce gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 phenotypes: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb + Ccbb \u2192 but wait, no\u2014it's F1 selfing, so the F2 would be CcBb producing gametes, leading to four F2 genotypes: CC (from CB+CB), Cc (from CB+cb), cc (from cb+cb), and bb (from cb+cb). Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nActually, the F2 from selfing F1 (CcBb) would include all possible combinations where each parent contributes a gamete. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: from CB + CB\n- Cc: from CB + cb\n- cc: from cb + cb\n- bb: from cb + cb\n\nBut then, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- CC: both genes dominant \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: pigment dominant (red), but body recessive (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n- cc: both genes recessive \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: both genes recessive \u2192 checkered brown\n\nSo now, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete in a 50% chance of CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- B: 75%\n- b: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 9/16\n\nBut wait, the options given don't match this exactly. Looking back at the choices:\n\nOptions G to J:\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, none of these seem to match the 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 ratio. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait a minute\u2014the question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, maybe I misread the parents. Are they:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red (so both genes dominant: CC BB)\n\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown (so both genes recessive: cc bb)\n\nYes, that's what I thought before. So F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the results of selfing F1. So the F2 genotypes would indeed follow the 25%, 50%, 25% distribution for each gene, leading to the phenotypic ratios I calculated earlier.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16. So perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2? Because the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated something. Let me double-check the probabilities.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: (Probability C is present) * (Probability B is present) = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Checkered brown: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain red: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the total population is 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: phenotypic ratio 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, which doesn't fit our calculation.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16?\nWait, option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. That could be another possibility. But according to our calculations, it's 9,3,3,1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that were the case, the F1 would be all CcBb, so the phenotypes would be 100% checkered red (since C is dominant) and 100% brown (since B is dominant). But that contradicts the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F1 generation, but that's not reflected in the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: \"show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So F2 is the correct focus.\n\nLooking at the options, none perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, but the order is different. Similarly, option D is 1,3,9,3. None of these match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is asking for the F1 generation, but the options don't align. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. For example, does the order of dominance affect the phenotype ratios? But in this case, the hierarchy is clear: C > c and B > b, so the order shouldn't matter.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's unlikely since dihybrid crosses usually assume independent assortment unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, let me consider the actual F2 counts. From the Punnett square, for each gene:\n\n- C: 3 dominant (C), 1 recessive (c)\n- B: 3 dominant (B), 1 recessive (b)\n\nThe number of phenotypes is the product of the two: 3*3=9 possible phenotypes? No, wait, each bird has two traits, so four phenotypes. As previously, 9,3,3,1.\n\nBut the options don't have 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: the dihybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Then, F2 is the F1 selfed, resulting in four F2 genotypes. \n\nAs per standard Mendelian inheritance, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this except perhaps Option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased.\n\nWait, looking again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16.\n\nThat would imply a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is similar to a dihybrid cross but with some discrepancy. Perhaps the question is actually referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's not typical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incomplete, or I misread the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, maybe I got the parents mixed up. Is the parent with the homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and the other being a plain brown (cc bb)? Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross between a red and a brown bird, but that wouldn't fit the given parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a monohybrid cross, but that's also not matching the options.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the question is asking about the F1 generation, not F2. In that case, all F1 would be CcBb, so all phenotypes would be 100% checkered red (since C is dominant) and 100% brown (since B is dominant). But that would mean the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is miswritten, and the parents are actually different. For instance, if one parent was CcBB and the other was ccBb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest option is Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which matches the F1 generation, but that doesn't fit the question's wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1, but the options suggest it's about F2.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the standard dihybrid cross expectation, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question has an error. However, given the options, none perfectly match, but perhaps the closest is Option E, which might be a typo in the order.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, not F2, but that leads to 100% checkered red and 100% brown, which isn't represented in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that's not presented.\n\nWait, I must conclude that based on the analysis, the correct ratio isn't listed among the options. However, if forced to choose, perhaps the intended answer is Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to a 3:9:1:3 ratio, suggesting a different setup.\n\nBut under the assumption that the question asks for F2, even though it's not present in the options, perhaps the best choice is Option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's not typically how Punnett squares work.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a cross between a heterozygous and a homozygous bird, but that still wouldn't lead to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest to the expected 9:3:3:1 is not present. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is Option E, despite the confusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown: checkered red\n2. Pigment red and body checkered: plain red\n3. Pigment plain and body brown: checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered: plain brown\n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nFor the pigment color (C locus):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 3/4 (since 3/4 of the time, either one of the two alleles is C)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 1/4\n\nFor the body color (B locus):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n- Checkered red (C c B b): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown (C c b b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red (c c B b): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown (c c b b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014let me make sure. The F2 is the result of a selfing of F1 (CcBb). So the F1 can produce gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 phenotypes: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb + Ccbb \u2192 but wait, no\u2014it's F1 selfing, so the F2 would be CcBb producing gametes, leading to four F2 genotypes: CC (from CB+CB), Cc (from CB+cb), cc (from cb+cb), and bb (from cb+cb). Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nActually, the F2 from selfing F1 (CcBb) would include all possible combinations where each parent contributes a gamete. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: from CB + CB\n- Cc: from CB + cb\n- cc: from cb + cb\n- bb: from cb + cb\n\nBut then, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- CC: both genes dominant \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: pigment dominant (red), but body recessive (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n- cc: both genes recessive \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: both genes recessive \u2192 checkered brown\n\nSo now, calculating the probabilities:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete in a 50% chance of CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- B: 75%\n- b: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 9/16\n\nBut wait, the options given don't match this exactly. Looking back at the choices:\n\nOptions G to J:\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, none of these seem to match the 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 ratio. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait a minute\u2014the question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, maybe I misread the parents. Are they:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red (so both genes dominant: CC BB)\n\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown (so both genes recessive: cc bb)\n\nYes, that's what I thought before. So F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the results of selfing F1. So the F2 genotypes would indeed follow the 25%, 50%, 25% distribution for each gene, leading to the phenotypic ratios I calculated earlier.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16. So perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2? Because the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated something. Let me double-check the probabilities.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: (Probability C is present) * (Probability B is present) = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Checkered brown: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain red: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the total population is 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: phenotypic ratio 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, which doesn't fit our calculation.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16?\nWait, option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. That could be another possibility. But according to our calculations, it's 9,3,3,1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2. If that were the case, the F1 would be all CcBb, so the phenotypes would be 100% checkered red (since C is dominant) and 100% brown (since B is dominant). But that contradicts the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F1 generation, but that's not reflected in the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: \"show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So F2 is the correct focus.\n\nLooking at the options, none perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, but the order is different. Similarly, option D is 1,3,9,3. None of these match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is asking for the F1 generation, but the options don't align. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. For example, does the order of dominance affect the phenotype ratios? But in this case, the hierarchy is clear: C > c and B > b, so the order shouldn't matter.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's unlikely since dihybrid crosses usually assume independent assortment unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, let me consider the actual F2 counts. From the Punnett square, for each gene:\n\n- C: 3 dominant (C), 1 recessive (c)\n- B: 3 dominant (B), 1 recessive (b)\n\nThe number of phenotypes is the product of the two: 3*3=9 possible phenotypes? No, wait, each bird has two traits, so four phenotypes. As previously, 9,3,3,1.\n\nBut the options don't have 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: the dihybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Then, F2 is the F1 selfed, resulting in four F2 genotypes. \n\nAs per standard Mendelian inheritance, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this except perhaps Option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased.\n\nWait, looking again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16.\n\nThat would imply a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is similar to a dihybrid cross but with some discrepancy. Perhaps the question is actually referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's not typical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incomplete, or I misread the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, maybe I got the parents mixed up. Is the parent with the homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and the other being a plain brown (cc bb)? Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross between a red and a brown bird, but that wouldn't fit the given parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a monohybrid cross, but that's also not matching the options.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the question is asking about the F1 generation, not F2. In that case, all F1 would be CcBb, so all phenotypes would be 100% checkered red (since C is dominant) and 100% brown (since B is dominant). But that would mean the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is miswritten, and the parents are actually different. For instance, if one parent was CcBB and the other was ccBb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest option is Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which matches the F1 generation, but that doesn't fit the question's wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1, but the options suggest it's about F2.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the standard dihybrid cross expectation, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question has an error. However, given the options, none perfectly match, but perhaps the closest is Option E, which might be a typo in the order.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, not F2, but that leads to 100% checkered red and 100% brown, which isn't represented in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that's not presented.\n\nWait, I must conclude that based on the analysis, the correct ratio isn't listed among the options. However, if forced to choose, perhaps the intended answer is Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to a 3:9:1:3 ratio, suggesting a different setup.\n\nBut under the assumption that the question asks for F2, even though it's not present in the options, perhaps the best choice is Option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's not typically how Punnett squares work.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a cross between a heterozygous and a homozygous bird, but that still wouldn't lead to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest to the expected 9:3:3:1 is not present. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is Option E, despite the confusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's list them:",
    "rollout": " Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability for each phenotype? For each gene, the dominant allele is expressed, so each bird will display the dominant trait unless the recessive allele is present. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 1/2\n- Absence (c): 1/2\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 1/2\n- Absence (b): 1/2\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on whether either gene is dominant. For example, a bird could have pigment red and body brown (C_B_), pigment red and body checkered (C_bb), plain and brown (cc_B_), or plain and checkered (cc_bb).\n\nThe number of possible combinations is 2^2 = 4, as each gene contributes two possibilities. However, some phenotypes may overlap, especially when both genes are recessive. In this case, the bird would have both traits expressed as plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but in our case, since the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), their offspring should all inherit both dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. That makes sense.\n\nBut let me double-check: The F2 generation is produced from F1 (CcBb) selfing. As established earlier, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nHowever, when considering both loci together, the phenotypes are combinations of the dominant traits. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of C/B status and c/b status. Since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by adding the probabilities where each trait is dominant.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use a Punnett square considering both genes. But given that the parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will show a certain distribution.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me see:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios, but without knowing the exact calculation, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment (C) and body (B). Each trait is determined by a separate gene, with dominant alleles expressing. Since the parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals will have at least one dominant allele for each gene due to Mendel's laws. This means all birds in the F2 generation will express both traits, except when the recessive alleles are present in both genes, resulting in plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but if all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, then all will have both traits expressed. That would mean all phenotypes would be present, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:0:0, which isn't among the options. Hmm, that suggests I might have misunderstood something.\n\nWait, no\u2014because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let's clarify:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Both genes are homozygous dominant.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Both genes are homozygous recessive.\n\nWhen these parents mate, their F1 will be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus (body):\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two distributions. The phenotypic ratio is determined by how often each combination appears across the F2 population.\n\nTo calculate this, we can consider each possible combination of C and B:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding up these fractions:\n\n1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/16 = (4/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16) = 9/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain red (cc_B_): 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): 1/16\n\nWhich translates to 4:2:2:1 in terms of counts (assuming 16 birds). But looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-express:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Thus, all will express both traits.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which would correspond to 4 checkered red (C_B_), 2 checkered brown (C_bb), 2 plain red (cc_B_), and 1 plain brown (cc_bb). Adding up to 9 birds, with 4 red, 2 brown, 2 red, 1 brown. That seems to fit option J, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but none of the options directly reflect 4:2:2:1. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the denominator. But according to my calculation, it should be 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 1 plain brown.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C_B_) | 1/4 \u2192 4 birds\nPlain red (cc_B_) | 1/8 \u2192 2 birds\nCheckered brown (C_bb) | 1/8 \u2192 2 birds\nPlain brown (cc_bb) | 1/16 \u2192 1 bird\n\nThis adds up to 9 birds, with 4 red, 2 brown, 2 red, 1 brown. But the options don't include this exact distribution. Looking back, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which sums to 20, but the total should be 16. Option E says 3,9,3,1, summing to 16. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. 3+9+3+1=16. Yes, that works. So E would have 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the numbers should be 4,2,2,1, which isn't any option. Maybe I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nAnother approach: Using Punnett squares for each gene separately and then combining them.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 always C\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 always c\n\nThus, in the offspring, 50% have C (red) and 50% have c (plain).\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 always B\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 always b\n\nThus, in the offspring, 50% have B (brown) and 50% have b (checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are:\n\n- C_B_: red, brown\n- C_bb: red, checkered\n- cc_B_: plain, brown\n- cc_bb: plain, checkered\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- C_B_: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- C_bb: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- cc_B_: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- cc_bb: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum would exceed 100%, but actually, each combination is mutually exclusive. Wait, no, each gene is considered independently, so the phenotypes are combinations of the two. So, in reality, each bird will have one phenotype for each gene, but the overall phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals must inherit at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them express both traits fully. So all will be either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 4:2:2:1, as previously thought, corresponding to 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options match this exactly, but looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which sums to 16. But according to my calculation, it should be 4,2,2,1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. If the recessive allele is dominant, then the order would reverse. Wait, no\u2014it's standard that dominant is expressed, regardless of the order. So perhaps the options are presented differently.\n\nLooking back, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 2+6+9+3=20, which exceeds 16, so it's impossible. Option E sums to 16 but presents different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement was misrepresented. Let me go back to the original question. It states that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The F2 generation is being analyzed, and the options provided seem to suggest that the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:3:1, which corresponds to option E. This ratio typically arises in a dihybrid cross when both parents are heterozygous for both genes, like AaBb x AaBb. However, in our case, the parents are homozygous for both traits, so all F2 should be fully expressing both traits, leading to 4:2:2:1, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the way the F2 is being considered. Let me clarify:\n\nIf both parents are homozygous for both traits (CC BB and cc bb), then all F2 would have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus expressing both traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the two traits, with each trait having a 50% chance. So, 25% for each combination, totaling 100%.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Plain red (cc_B_): 25% \u2192 4 out of 16?\nWait, no, because for each gene, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So for C locus, 50% red and 50% plain. Similarly for B locus.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1/4:1/8:1/8:1/16, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1 when converted to 16 birds.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which would imply that the F2 generation includes both homozygous and heterozygous individuals. Perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous for both traits, then all F2 will be heterozygous for both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Homozygous parents (CC BB and cc bb) will produce gametes that are C/B and c/b, respectively. When crossed, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb selfed, producing a variety of gametes including C/B, c/B, C/b, and c/b. Thus, F2 will have a range of genotypes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nWait, now I realize that I initially approached this incorrectly by considering each gene separately, but in reality, the F2 will have a range of genotypes based on the law of inheritance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the two genes, leading to four phenotypes, each with specific frequencies.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to a combined ratio of 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the classic dihybrid cross ratio, which results in nine phenotypic classes. But in our case, since all F2 individuals are fully expressing both traits, the ratio would be different.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this systematically. For the F2 generation, each gene will be present in the F2, but the interaction between the two genes determines the phenotypes.\n\nGiven that both parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the two genes, each occurring with a certain probability.\n\nThe F2 genotype frequencies are as follows:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C):\n  - 25% CC (red)\n  - 50% Cc (red)\n  - 25% cc (plain)\n\n- For the body gene (B):\n  - 25% BB (brown)\n  - 50% Bb (brown)\n  - 25% bb (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering each combination:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown (C Bb)\n3. CC bb: Checkered checkered (C bb)\n4. CC BB: Checkered red (same as above)\nWait, no\u2014I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead create a Punnett square for the F2 cross.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are C/B, c/B, C/b, c/b. The Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\n- C/B \u00d7 C/B: CC BB (25%), CcBB (25%), CcBb (25%), CC Bb (25%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square for the F2 would involve all possible combinations of the gametes.\n\nActually, the F2 genotype frequencies are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The actual F2 genotype frequencies are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 50% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right. The correct F2 genotype frequencies for a dihybrid cross when both parents are heterozygous (AaBb \u00d7 AaBb) are:\n\n- 1/16 AA BB\n- 2/16 AA Bb\n- 2/16 AA bb\n- 2/16 Aa BB\n- 4/16 Aa Bb\n- 2/16 Aa bb\n- 2/16 aa BB\n- 4/16 aa Bb\n- 1/16 aa bb\n\nBut in our case, the parents are homozygous for both traits (CC BB and cc bb), so the F2 will have a different genotype distribution. Specifically, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the two genes, each with equal frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThis leads to the same phenotypic ratios as before, resulting in 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the closest one that fits the 4:2:2:1 ratio is option",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability for each phenotype? For each gene, the dominant allele is expressed, so each bird will display the dominant trait unless the recessive allele is present. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 1/2\n- Absence (c): 1/2\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 1/2\n- Absence (b): 1/2\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on whether either gene is dominant. For example, a bird could have pigment red and body brown (C_B_), pigment red and body checkered (C_bb), plain and brown (cc_B_), or plain and checkered (cc_bb).\n\nThe number of possible combinations is 2^2 = 4, as each gene contributes two possibilities. However, some phenotypes may overlap, especially when both genes are recessive. In this case, the bird would have both traits expressed as plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but in our case, since the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), their offspring should all inherit both dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. That makes sense.\n\nBut let me double-check: The F2 generation is produced from F1 (CcBb) selfing. As established earlier, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nHowever, when considering both loci together, the phenotypes are combinations of the dominant traits. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of C/B status and c/b status. Since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by adding the probabilities where each trait is dominant.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use a Punnett square considering both genes. But given that the parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will show a certain distribution.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me see:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios, but without knowing the exact calculation, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment (C) and body (B). Each trait is determined by a separate gene, with dominant alleles expressing. Since the parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals will have at least one dominant allele for each gene due to Mendel's laws. This means all birds in the F2 generation will express both traits, except when the recessive alleles are present in both genes, resulting in plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but if all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, then all will have both traits expressed. That would mean all phenotypes would be present, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:0:0, which isn't among the options. Hmm, that suggests I might have misunderstood something.\n\nWait, no\u2014because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let's clarify:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Both genes are homozygous dominant.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Both genes are homozygous recessive.\n\nWhen these parents mate, their F1 will be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus (body):\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two distributions. The phenotypic ratio is determined by how often each combination appears across the F2 population.\n\nTo calculate this, we can consider each possible combination of C and B:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding up these fractions:\n\n1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/16 = (4/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16) = 9/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain red (cc_B_): 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): 1/16\n\nWhich translates to 4:2:2:1 in terms of counts (assuming 16 birds). But looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-express:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Thus, all will express both traits.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which would correspond to 4 checkered red (C_B_), 2 checkered brown (C_bb), 2 plain red (cc_B_), and 1 plain brown (cc_bb). Adding up to 9 birds, with 4 red, 2 brown, 2 red, 1 brown. That seems to fit option J, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but none of the options directly reflect 4:2:2:1. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the denominator. But according to my calculation, it should be 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 1 plain brown.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C_B_) | 1/4 \u2192 4 birds\nPlain red (cc_B_) | 1/8 \u2192 2 birds\nCheckered brown (C_bb) | 1/8 \u2192 2 birds\nPlain brown (cc_bb) | 1/16 \u2192 1 bird\n\nThis adds up to 9 birds, with 4 red, 2 brown, 2 red, 1 brown. But the options don't include this exact distribution. Looking back, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which sums to 20, but the total should be 16. Option E says 3,9,3,1, summing to 16. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. 3+9+3+1=16. Yes, that works. So E would have 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the numbers should be 4,2,2,1, which isn't any option. Maybe I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nAnother approach: Using Punnett squares for each gene separately and then combining them.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 always C\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 always c\n\nThus, in the offspring, 50% have C (red) and 50% have c (plain).\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 always B\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 always b\n\nThus, in the offspring, 50% have B (brown) and 50% have b (checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are:\n\n- C_B_: red, brown\n- C_bb: red, checkered\n- cc_B_: plain, brown\n- cc_bb: plain, checkered\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- C_B_: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- C_bb: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- cc_B_: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- cc_bb: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum would exceed 100%, but actually, each combination is mutually exclusive. Wait, no, each gene is considered independently, so the phenotypes are combinations of the two. So, in reality, each bird will have one phenotype for each gene, but the overall phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals must inherit at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them express both traits fully. So all will be either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 4:2:2:1, as previously thought, corresponding to 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options match this exactly, but looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which sums to 16. But according to my calculation, it should be 4,2,2,1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. If the recessive allele is dominant, then the order would reverse. Wait, no\u2014it's standard that dominant is expressed, regardless of the order. So perhaps the options are presented differently.\n\nLooking back, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 2+6+9+3=20, which exceeds 16, so it's impossible. Option E sums to 16 but presents different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement was misrepresented. Let me go back to the original question. It states that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The F2 generation is being analyzed, and the options provided seem to suggest that the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:3:1, which corresponds to option E. This ratio typically arises in a dihybrid cross when both parents are heterozygous for both genes, like AaBb x AaBb. However, in our case, the parents are homozygous for both traits, so all F2 should be fully expressing both traits, leading to 4:2:2:1, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the way the F2 is being considered. Let me clarify:\n\nIf both parents are homozygous for both traits (CC BB and cc bb), then all F2 would have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus expressing both traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the two traits, with each trait having a 50% chance. So, 25% for each combination, totaling 100%.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Plain red (cc_B_): 25% \u2192 4 out of 16?\nWait, no, because for each gene, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So for C locus, 50% red and 50% plain. Similarly for B locus.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1/4:1/8:1/8:1/16, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1 when converted to 16 birds.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which would imply that the F2 generation includes both homozygous and heterozygous individuals. Perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous for both traits, then all F2 will be heterozygous for both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Homozygous parents (CC BB and cc bb) will produce gametes that are C/B and c/b, respectively. When crossed, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb selfed, producing a variety of gametes including C/B, c/B, C/b, and c/b. Thus, F2 will have a range of genotypes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nWait, now I realize that I initially approached this incorrectly by considering each gene separately, but in reality, the F2 will have a range of genotypes based on the law of inheritance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the two genes, leading to four phenotypes, each with specific frequencies.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to a combined ratio of 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the classic dihybrid cross ratio, which results in nine phenotypic classes. But in our case, since all F2 individuals are fully expressing both traits, the ratio would be different.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this systematically. For the F2 generation, each gene will be present in the F2, but the interaction between the two genes determines the phenotypes.\n\nGiven that both parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the two genes, each occurring with a certain probability.\n\nThe F2 genotype frequencies are as follows:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C):\n  - 25% CC (red)\n  - 50% Cc (red)\n  - 25% cc (plain)\n\n- For the body gene (B):\n  - 25% BB (brown)\n  - 50% Bb (brown)\n  - 25% bb (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering each combination:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown (C Bb)\n3. CC bb: Checkered checkered (C bb)\n4. CC BB: Checkered red (same as above)\nWait, no\u2014I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead create a Punnett square for the F2 cross.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are C/B, c/B, C/b, c/b. The Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\n- C/B \u00d7 C/B: CC BB (25%), CcBB (25%), CcBb (25%), CC Bb (25%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square for the F2 would involve all possible combinations of the gametes.\n\nActually, the F2 genotype frequencies are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The actual F2 genotype frequencies are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 50% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right. The correct F2 genotype frequencies for a dihybrid cross when both parents are heterozygous (AaBb \u00d7 AaBb) are:\n\n- 1/16 AA BB\n- 2/16 AA Bb\n- 2/16 AA bb\n- 2/16 Aa BB\n- 4/16 Aa Bb\n- 2/16 Aa bb\n- 2/16 aa BB\n- 4/16 aa Bb\n- 1/16 aa bb\n\nBut in our case, the parents are homozygous for both traits (CC BB and cc bb), so the F2 will have a different genotype distribution. Specifically, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the two genes, each with equal frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThis leads to the same phenotypic ratios as before, resulting in 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the closest one that fits the 4:2:2:1 ratio is option",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment: C (red), Body: B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Pigment: C (red), Body: b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Pigment: c (plain), Body: B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Pigment: c (plain), Body: b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s not like that. Because for each bird, the two traits (pigment and body) are determined separately. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If pigment is dominant (C) and body is dominant (B): Red Brown\n- If pigment is dominant (C) and body is recessive (b): Red Checkered\n- If pigment is recessive (c) and body is dominant (B): Plain Brown\n- If pigment is recessive (c) and body is recessive (b): Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the inheritance follows Mendel's laws.\n\nFor the C locus (pigenment):\n\nEach parent is heterozygous (CC and cc), so the gametes are 50% C and 50% c. For the B locus (body color):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) gives CB gametes (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2 (cc bb) gives cb gametes (both alleles are recessive).\n\nSo when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete is either CB or cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's assuming random segregation. Alternatively, considering the actual alleles contributed by each parent, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C locus:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSimilarly, for B locus:\n\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nHowever, since the genes are acting independently, the combined F2 phenotypes would be the product of the individual probabilities. So, for each trait, the probability is 2/3 (for dominant) and 1/3 (recessive) for each parent. Wait, no\u2014each parent has a 50% chance of contributing either allele for each gene. So for each gene, the probability of dominant is 50%, recessive is 50%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. However, since the traits are linked (i.e., the expression might be influenced by epistasis or dominance interactions), it complicates things. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype Frequency = (Proportion of C) * (Proportion of B) + (Proportion of c) * (Proportion of b) \n\nBut actually, the correct approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine the results. However, given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation and determine the phenotypes.\n\nLet me try to construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC (dominant C) and BB (dominant B)\n- CB \u00d7 CB = Cc (dominant C and recessive B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (dominant C and recessive B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = cc (recessive C and recessive B)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = same as above\n- cb \u00d7 CB = same\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc (recessive C and recessive B)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities. However, without knowing any dominance relationships beyond what's already stated, we proceed under the assumption that each phenotype is a combination of both traits. But wait, the question specifies that C determines pigment color, and B determines body color, but doesn't mention dominance over the other. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and we need to calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the possible combinations of C and B.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait, assuming independence. However, for each bird, the two traits are determined by separate genes, but their expression may influence the phenotype. However, since the question doesn\u2019t specify dominance interactions beyond the basic C/B definitions, we\u2019ll assume that each bird\u2019s phenotype is determined solely by its alleles for each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the possible alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of dominant (C) = 50%\n- Probability of recessive (c) = 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of dominant (B) = 50%\n- Probability of recessive (b) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait:\n\n- Red Brown (C dominant and B dominant): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n- Red Checkered (C dominant and b recessive): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n- Plain Brown (c recessive and B dominant): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n- Plain Checkered (c recessive and b recessive): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nWait, but that sums up to 1, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking at the options provided, none seem to match this exactly. Let me review the options again.\n\nOptions A to H provide various phenotypic ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to suggest a different distribution. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming independence when the question implies that some traits might be affected by others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypic ratios. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- C (pigment) is dominant over c (plain)\n- B (color) is dominant over b (checkered)\n\nThis means that an individual must have both dominant alleles (C and B) to exhibit the most dominant phenotype (Red Brown). If either C or B is recessive, the phenotype becomes less intense. For example:\n\n- C (red) and b (checkered): Red Checkered\n- c (plain) and B (brown): Plain Brown\n- c (plain) and b (checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nSo the order of dominance is important here. Now, considering that, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by calculating the proportion of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. For the C locus:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (CC): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Cc): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (cc): 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (BB): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Bb): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (bb): 25%\n\nNow, considering the combination of these, the number of each genotype in the F2 is:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- CC Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- CC bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Cc BB: 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n- Cc Bb: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n- Cc bb: 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n- cc BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- cc Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, for each genotype, we'll determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered (same as above, but perhaps it's considered differently)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 c recessive (plain) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Red Checkered: Cases 2, 3, 6, 7 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain Brown: Case 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain Checkered: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nTotal cases: 9\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- Red Brown: 2/9\n- Red Checkered: 4/9\n- Plain Brown: 1/9\n- Plain Checkered: 2/9\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculations. Option J suggests checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Our calculation shows checkered brown has 4 cases, which isn't listed. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, our numbers don't align. Option F is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which also isn't among the choices. Option C has checkered red 9, which is too high. Option D has checkered red 1, which is wrong. Option A has a different ratio. Option B is similar but different. Option H is another 1:1:1:1. Option I has a different ratio. Option G is the closest, but it's not matching our counts. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each genotype:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, checking each:\n\n- Red Brown: 1,4 \u2192 2\n- Red Checkered: 2,3,6,7 \u2192 4\n- Plain Brown: 5 \u2192 1\n- Plain Checkered: 8,9 \u2192 2\n\nSo the ratio is 2:4:1:2, which simplifies to 2:4:1:2 or 1:2:0.5:1 when expressed as fractions. To make it into whole numbers, multiply each by 2: 2:4:2:4, totaling 12. So the simplified ratio is 2:4:1:2, which corresponds to 1:2:0.5:1 when divided by 2. However, in terms of whole numbers, the ratio is 2:4:1:2, which is equivalent to 1:2:0.5:1. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this except option G, which states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOur calculation shows:\n\n- checkered red: 0 (since all red phenotypes are checkered, but according to the options, maybe 'checkered' refers to red and brown. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terminology. The options refer to phenotypes, not the color. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, in the options, \"checkered\" refers to the pigmentation, i.e., the color based on the B and b alleles. So, for instance, option G says checkered red 12, which would mean that 12 of the F2 birds have both checkered pigmentation (b) and red pigment (B is dominant, so B is present, so they're red). Similarly, checkered brown would be those with b (checkered) and B (red), so brown. Plain red would have both c (plain) and B (red), and plain brown would have both c (plain) and b (checkered).\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red (phenotype where both B and b are present?) Wait, no\u2014checkered is when b is present, regardless of the pigment color. So, checkered would be when b is present (regardless of whether B is present or not). So, in the F2, the checkered phenotype includes all that have b (regardless of B). Similarly, plain would include all that have c.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIn genetics, when talking about coat color, 'checkered' usually refers to a specific pattern due to a particular allele being recessive, while 'plain' is dominant. In this context, 'checkered' likely refers to the recessive allele (b), and 'plain' refers to the dominant (B). Similarly, 'red' is dominant (B) and 'brown' is dominant (B). So:\n\n- Checkered: b (regardless of B)\n- Plain: B (since B is dominant, but 'plain' could imply B is dominant and b is recessive, but perhaps in this case, it's the opposite.)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, 'red' is dominant (B), so 'red' is the presence of at least one dominant B allele, and 'checkered' is the recessive b. So, 'checkered' (b) is when the bird is homozygous recessive for the pigment color, and 'plain' is when the bird has at least one dominant B allele.\n\nSimilarly, for color, 'brown' is dominant (B), 'checkered' is recessive (b). So, 'brown' is B, 'checkered' is b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be grouped as:\n\n- Checkered: b (regardless of B)\n- Plain: B (B is dominant, so presence of B allele leads to brown)\n- Brown: B (presence of B leads to brown)\n- Red: B (presence of B leads to red)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because 'red' is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will be red, and 'checkered' is when both alleles are b. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red (B present): Phenotype dependent on B and b.\n- Brown (B present): Phenotype dependent on B and b.\n- Checkered (b present): Phenotype dependent on B and b.\n\nBut since 'red' is dominant, having even one B allele will result in red, unless the other allele is dominant as well. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant, any bird with at least one B allele will express red, regardless of the other allele. So:\n\n- All birds with at least one B allele (Bb, BB, Bb, BB, etc.) will display red color.\n\n- All birds with both b alleles will display checkered color.\n\nSimilarly, brown is a separate trait. But since brown is also determined by B, and checkered is b, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is B (red) or bb (checkered), and similarly for brown, which is B (brown) or bb (checkered). But the question seems to be mixing two traits\u2014pigment color and body color\u2014but each is determined by separate loci. So, the overall phenotype is a combination of both.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. From our previous analysis, the F2 has:\n\n- 2 checkered red (assuming that 'red' is dominant and 'checkered' is recessive, so all that have at least one B allele are red, and all that have both b alleles are checkered)\n- 4 checkered brown\n- 1 plain red (all that have B but not b)\n- 2 plain brown (all that have b but not B)\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in reality, the presence of B (at least one) leads to red, and the presence of b (both) leads to checkered. So:\n\n- Checkered: all that have b (both alleles) \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain: all that have B (at least one B allele) \u2192 7 cases\n- Brown: all that have B (at least one B allele) \u2192 6 cases\n- Red: all that have B (at least one B allele) \u2192 7 cases?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it systematically.\n\nIn the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment: C (red), Body: B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Pigment: C (red), Body: b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Pigment: c (plain), Body: B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Pigment: c (plain), Body: b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s not like that. Because for each bird, the two traits (pigment and body) are determined separately. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If pigment is dominant (C) and body is dominant (B): Red Brown\n- If pigment is dominant (C) and body is recessive (b): Red Checkered\n- If pigment is recessive (c) and body is dominant (B): Plain Brown\n- If pigment is recessive (c) and body is recessive (b): Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the inheritance follows Mendel's laws.\n\nFor the C locus (pigenment):\n\nEach parent is heterozygous (CC and cc), so the gametes are 50% C and 50% c. For the B locus (body color):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) gives CB gametes (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2 (cc bb) gives cb gametes (both alleles are recessive).\n\nSo when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete is either CB or cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's assuming random segregation. Alternatively, considering the actual alleles contributed by each parent, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C locus:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSimilarly, for B locus:\n\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nHowever, since the genes are acting independently, the combined F2 phenotypes would be the product of the individual probabilities. So, for each trait, the probability is 2/3 (for dominant) and 1/3 (recessive) for each parent. Wait, no\u2014each parent has a 50% chance of contributing either allele for each gene. So for each gene, the probability of dominant is 50%, recessive is 50%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. However, since the traits are linked (i.e., the expression might be influenced by epistasis or dominance interactions), it complicates things. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype Frequency = (Proportion of C) * (Proportion of B) + (Proportion of c) * (Proportion of b) \n\nBut actually, the correct approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine the results. However, given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation and determine the phenotypes.\n\nLet me try to construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC (dominant C) and BB (dominant B)\n- CB \u00d7 CB = Cc (dominant C and recessive B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (dominant C and recessive B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = cc (recessive C and recessive B)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = same as above\n- cb \u00d7 CB = same\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc (recessive C and recessive B)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities. However, without knowing any dominance relationships beyond what's already stated, we proceed under the assumption that each phenotype is a combination of both traits. But wait, the question specifies that C determines pigment color, and B determines body color, but doesn't mention dominance over the other. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and we need to calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the possible combinations of C and B.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait, assuming independence. However, for each bird, the two traits are determined by separate genes, but their expression may influence the phenotype. However, since the question doesn\u2019t specify dominance interactions beyond the basic C/B definitions, we\u2019ll assume that each bird\u2019s phenotype is determined solely by its alleles for each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the possible alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of dominant (C) = 50%\n- Probability of recessive (c) = 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of dominant (B) = 50%\n- Probability of recessive (b) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait:\n\n- Red Brown (C dominant and B dominant): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n- Red Checkered (C dominant and b recessive): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n- Plain Brown (c recessive and B dominant): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n- Plain Checkered (c recessive and b recessive): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nWait, but that sums up to 1, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking at the options provided, none seem to match this exactly. Let me review the options again.\n\nOptions A to H provide various phenotypic ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to suggest a different distribution. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming independence when the question implies that some traits might be affected by others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypic ratios. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- C (pigment) is dominant over c (plain)\n- B (color) is dominant over b (checkered)\n\nThis means that an individual must have both dominant alleles (C and B) to exhibit the most dominant phenotype (Red Brown). If either C or B is recessive, the phenotype becomes less intense. For example:\n\n- C (red) and b (checkered): Red Checkered\n- c (plain) and B (brown): Plain Brown\n- c (plain) and b (checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nSo the order of dominance is important here. Now, considering that, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by calculating the proportion of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. For the C locus:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (CC): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Cc): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (cc): 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (BB): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Bb): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (bb): 25%\n\nNow, considering the combination of these, the number of each genotype in the F2 is:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- CC Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- CC bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Cc BB: 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n- Cc Bb: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n- Cc bb: 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n- cc BB: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- cc Bb: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, for each genotype, we'll determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered (same as above, but perhaps it's considered differently)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 c recessive (plain) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Red Checkered: Cases 2, 3, 6, 7 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain Brown: Case 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain Checkered: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nTotal cases: 9\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- Red Brown: 2/9\n- Red Checkered: 4/9\n- Plain Brown: 1/9\n- Plain Checkered: 2/9\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculations. Option J suggests checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Our calculation shows checkered brown has 4 cases, which isn't listed. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, our numbers don't align. Option F is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which also isn't among the choices. Option C has checkered red 9, which is too high. Option D has checkered red 1, which is wrong. Option A has a different ratio. Option B is similar but different. Option H is another 1:1:1:1. Option I has a different ratio. Option G is the closest, but it's not matching our counts. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each genotype:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, checking each:\n\n- Red Brown: 1,4 \u2192 2\n- Red Checkered: 2,3,6,7 \u2192 4\n- Plain Brown: 5 \u2192 1\n- Plain Checkered: 8,9 \u2192 2\n\nSo the ratio is 2:4:1:2, which simplifies to 2:4:1:2 or 1:2:0.5:1 when expressed as fractions. To make it into whole numbers, multiply each by 2: 2:4:2:4, totaling 12. So the simplified ratio is 2:4:1:2, which corresponds to 1:2:0.5:1 when divided by 2. However, in terms of whole numbers, the ratio is 2:4:1:2, which is equivalent to 1:2:0.5:1. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this except option G, which states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOur calculation shows:\n\n- checkered red: 0 (since all red phenotypes are checkered, but according to the options, maybe 'checkered' refers to red and brown. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terminology. The options refer to phenotypes, not the color. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, in the options, \"checkered\" refers to the pigmentation, i.e., the color based on the B and b alleles. So, for instance, option G says checkered red 12, which would mean that 12 of the F2 birds have both checkered pigmentation (b) and red pigment (B is dominant, so B is present, so they're red). Similarly, checkered brown would be those with b (checkered) and B (red), so brown. Plain red would have both c (plain) and B (red), and plain brown would have both c (plain) and b (checkered).\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red (phenotype where both B and b are present?) Wait, no\u2014checkered is when b is present, regardless of the pigment color. So, checkered would be when b is present (regardless of whether B is present or not). So, in the F2, the checkered phenotype includes all that have b (regardless of B). Similarly, plain would include all that have c.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIn genetics, when talking about coat color, 'checkered' usually refers to a specific pattern due to a particular allele being recessive, while 'plain' is dominant. In this context, 'checkered' likely refers to the recessive allele (b), and 'plain' refers to the dominant (B). Similarly, 'red' is dominant (B) and 'brown' is dominant (B). So:\n\n- Checkered: b (regardless of B)\n- Plain: B (since B is dominant, but 'plain' could imply B is dominant and b is recessive, but perhaps in this case, it's the opposite.)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, 'red' is dominant (B), so 'red' is the presence of at least one dominant B allele, and 'checkered' is the recessive b. So, 'checkered' (b) is when the bird is homozygous recessive for the pigment color, and 'plain' is when the bird has at least one dominant B allele.\n\nSimilarly, for color, 'brown' is dominant (B), 'checkered' is recessive (b). So, 'brown' is B, 'checkered' is b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be grouped as:\n\n- Checkered: b (regardless of B)\n- Plain: B (B is dominant, so presence of B allele leads to brown)\n- Brown: B (presence of B leads to brown)\n- Red: B (presence of B leads to red)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because 'red' is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will be red, and 'checkered' is when both alleles are b. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red (B present): Phenotype dependent on B and b.\n- Brown (B present): Phenotype dependent on B and b.\n- Checkered (b present): Phenotype dependent on B and b.\n\nBut since 'red' is dominant, having even one B allele will result in red, unless the other allele is dominant as well. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant, any bird with at least one B allele will express red, regardless of the other allele. So:\n\n- All birds with at least one B allele (Bb, BB, Bb, BB, etc.) will display red color.\n\n- All birds with both b alleles will display checkered color.\n\nSimilarly, brown is a separate trait. But since brown is also determined by B, and checkered is b, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is B (red) or bb (checkered), and similarly for brown, which is B (brown) or bb (checkered). But the question seems to be mixing two traits\u2014pigment color and body color\u2014but each is determined by separate loci. So, the overall phenotype is a combination of both.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. From our previous analysis, the F2 has:\n\n- 2 checkered red (assuming that 'red' is dominant and 'checkered' is recessive, so all that have at least one B allele are red, and all that have both b alleles are checkered)\n- 4 checkered brown\n- 1 plain red (all that have B but not b)\n- 2 plain brown (all that have b but not B)\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in reality, the presence of B (at least one) leads to red, and the presence of b (both) leads to checkered. So:\n\n- Checkered: all that have b (both alleles) \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain: all that have B (at least one B allele) \u2192 7 cases\n- Brown: all that have B (at least one B allele) \u2192 6 cases\n- Red: all that have B (at least one B allele) \u2192 7 cases?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it systematically.\n\nIn the",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",

Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but actually, the presence of the dominant allele for each gene leads to those phenotypes. So for pigment color, C is present (red) or not (plain). Similarly for body color, B is present (brown) or not (checkered). Thus, the phenotypic combinations would indeed be the four above.\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting and follows Mendel's laws, the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (Red): Probability = (Number of C gametes / Total gametes)^2 = (3/4)^2 = 9/16\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s if it's a single gene. Actually, in F2, the probability for pigment color being present is the sum of the probabilities where at least one dominant allele is present. Alternatively, since each gamete contributes one allele, the probability that C is present in any gamete is 3/4 (since 3/4 of gametes are CB, Cc, and CC; cb is 1/4). Wait, no, actually, each gamete is a combination of one allele from each parent. In this case, each parent is Cc, so each gamete has a 50% chance of being C or c. So for pigment color (C/c), the probability of having at least one dominant allele (C) is 3/4 (since the only way to have no C is to have c from both parents, which is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4). So the probability of pigment red is 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B/b), the bird is bb (since the parents are cc and bb). Wait, no\u2014parents are cc and bb, so all F2 will be cc and bb? Wait, no\u2014parents are cc and bb, so F1 is CcBb, and F2 would be formed by F1 selfing, so the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Probability of C (present) = 3/4\n- Probability of c (absent) = 1/4\n\nFor the body gene (B/b):\n\n- Probability of B (present) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (absent) = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present (Red and Brown): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment present, body absent (Red and Checkered): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Pigment absent, body present (Plain red, Brown): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n4. Both absent (Plain brown): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 absent. Since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are combinations of whether pigment is present or not, and whether body is present or not.\n\nBut actually, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the actual phenotypic ratios are determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the two traits are independent, then the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn't align.\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes!

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So: 1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): checkered red (C_B_)\n2.",
    "rollout": " So:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): plain red (c_b_)\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): checkered brown (c_B_)\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): plain brown (c_b)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes.\n\nSince each parent contributes gametes at a 50% chance for each allele, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each possible genotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be based on how many of those genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since there are four possible phenotypes (as above), and each has an equal chance in F2 (since the parents are homozygous and selfing), the ratios would be 1/4 for each phenotype. But wait, that doesn't seem right because some phenotypes might have different numbers depending on dominance. Wait, in this case, both genes are acting independently, and each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. Since each gene is dominant, all genotypes will express their traits fully. Therefore, each phenotype is equally likely, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. But looking back at the options, none directly match this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the dominance affects the ratios differently. Let me double-check. If we consider dominance, then certain combinations may not occur, reducing the number of phenotypes. But in this problem, the dominant alleles are expressed regardless of the other gene. So all combinations are viable, leading to four phenotypes. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But looking at the answer choices, option D says 1,3,9,3, which isn't matching. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which also seems off. Option A has 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16. Option B has 8:4:0:4, summing to 16. Option C: 9+3+3+1=16. Option D: 1+3+9+3=16. Option E: same as D. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Option H: same as D. Option I: same as D. Option J: same as D. Wait, none of them have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem assumes that some phenotypes don't exist due to dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore one phenotype, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation refers to the F1 x F1, but earlier analysis suggests that's F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but given the answer choices, it's more likely about F2. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio without considering dominance, but that still doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach where some phenotypes aren't shown. Given the options, the most plausible answer is D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, why would that be? Let me recalculate the probabilities. Since each gene has a 50% chance of being passed, the combined probabilities for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red (Cc B_): 25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc b_): 25%\n- Plain red (cc B_): 25%\n- Plain brown (cc b_): 25%\n\nSo the ratios are indeed 1:1:1:1. But in the options, no choice shows this. Perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead. If that were the case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (if both C and B are present)\n- Checkered brown (if C is present but B is absent)\n- Plain red (if neither C nor B are present)\n- Plain brown (if C is absent but B is present)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Let me think again. In F1 (CcBb):\n\n- Pigment color (C): presence \u2192 red\n- Body color (B): presence \u2192 brown\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigmented red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain red\n3. Pigmented plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Pigmented plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur with equal frequency because each parent contributes gametes at a 50% rate for each allele. Therefore, the F1 generation would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But this doesn\u2019t match any of the answer choices. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 sum 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2014 sum 16. Option I: 7,5,1,3 \u2014 sum 16. None have a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1, but in reality, the F2 would have the 1:1:1:1 ratio. Since none of the options reflect this, I must reconsider. Maybe the question intended to refer to the F1 rather than F2, but the options suggest otherwise. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Given the available options, the closest is option D, which lists the counts as 1,3,9,3. But according to my calculation, each phenotype should appear once, so perhaps the question considers only two phenotypes, ignoring dominance, but that contradicts the standard genetics approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to consider the segregation of each gene separately and then combine the results. \n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each gene independently. For pigment color:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC) gives C always.\n- Parent 2 (cc) gives c always.\n\nThus, the pigment color in F1 will always be c (plain), and in F2, it will follow a Mendelian pattern. Similarly, for body color:\n\n- Parent 1 (BB) gives B always.\n- Parent 2 (bb) gives b always.\n\nThus, the body color in F1 will always be b (checkered), and in F2, it follows a Mendelian pattern. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of pigment and body colors. Since both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each combination:\n\n- Pigmented red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 checkered red (r = C_B_, b = bb)\n- Pigmented red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain red (r = C_bb, b = bb)\n- Pigmented plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (r = cc_B_, b = bb)\n- Pigmented plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain brown (r = cc_bb, b = bb)\n\nThus, each phenotype appears 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this doesn't match any of the answer choices. Therefore, perhaps the question intended to ask about F1 instead, but the options don't include that either. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the available choices, none perfectly matches the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio, but option D suggests 1,3,9,3, which could imply that only three phenotypes are considered, possibly ignoring one due to dominance or other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but F1 is monohybrid, while F2 is dihybrid. This confusion makes it difficult to choose the correct option. Given the lack of clarity, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question is asking about the F2 generation, despite the mismatch with the answer options. Since none of the options exactly match the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer was option D, which lists the counts as 1,3,9,3, even though it's not strictly accurate. Alternatively, I might have misread the options. Upon reviewing, option D states \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which adds up to 16. However, in reality, each phenotype should occur once in F2, making the correct ratio 1:1:1:1. Since none of the options reflect this, I might have made a mistake elsewhere. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait! The user wrote the question incorrectly in the beginning, swapping im_start and im_end. That's probably a typo, but it's better to assume the correct order. Assuming the correct question is about the F2 generation, but the answer options do not reflect the expected ratio, perhaps the intended answer is option D, which lists the counts as 1,3,9,3. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, which would lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across F1, but that's not listed either.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, implying that the presence of c results in a checkered pattern regardless of the pigment color.",
    "rollout": " However, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, implying that the presence of c results in a checkered pattern regardless of the pigment color. Similarly, the presence of b results in plain body regardless of the color. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a distinct phenotype from the regular pigmented ones. Hmm, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me consider that:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C or c) and body color (B or b). The phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and B is present (brown) or not (checkered). However, the checkered pattern is a separate phenotype, so a bird could have a checkered body regardless of the pigment color. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of c makes it checkered, while any other combination makes it plain. But the problem says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C,\" implying that C is dominant, so c leads to checkered. Similarly, brown is controlled by B, with b being recessive (plain). So each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented red (C_B_)\n- Pigmented brown (C_bb)\n- Plain red (cc_B_)\n- Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nWait, but in reality, it's more accurate to say:\n\n- Checkered: due to the c allele at the pigment gene.\n- Plain: due to the c allele at the pigment gene.\n- Brown: depends on B. If B is present, it's brown; if absent, it's plain.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, so perhaps the presence of c causes the checkered pattern, but whether it's brown or plain depends on another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the B and c alleles determine the color. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a separate phenotype, and the color is determined by the B and b alleles. So, if B is present, the bird is brown, else plain. The checkered pattern is always present regardless of B. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: c (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Checkered brown: c and b (brown)\n- Plain red: cc (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Plain brown: cc and b\n\nSo the four phenotypes. Now, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, I'll need to determine how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation. To do this, I'll use the standard Mendelian dihybrid cross approach, calculating the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible genotypes in the F2 generation. From the F1, which is CcBb, selfing produces F2 with four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Wait, no\u2014when you self CcBb, you get four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But since C and B are independent, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25% (since CB contributes C and B, cb contributes c and b \u2192 Cc)\n- Cc (same as above)\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, to combine these, considering the independence of the genes, the overall phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C) and body color (B). The phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented red: C is present (either C_B_ or C_bb)\n- Pigmented brown: C is present (C_B_ or C_bb) \u2192 same as above\n- Plain red: c (dominant) in pigment (so cc) combined with B present (B_) \u2192 cc_B_\n- Plain brown: c (dominant) in pigment (cc) combined with B present (B_) \u2192 cc_b_\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, which suggests that c in the pigment gene makes it checkered, and the color (brown or plain) is determined by the B locus. So perhaps the checkered pattern is always present, regardless of the color. That would mean:\n\n- Checkered red: c (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Checkered brown: c (pigment) and b (brown)\n- Plain red: cc (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Plain brown: cc (pigment) and b (brown)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes correspond to the presence of c (checkered) and the presence of B (brown). Now, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, I need to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles that lead to each phenotype.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - Pigmented red (since C is present)\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - Pigmented red (C present)\n3. Cc (50%):\n   - Pigmented red (C present)\n4. cc (25%):\n   - Plain red (only cc, no C present)\n\nWait, but this doesn't account for the B locus. Actually, the presence of B determines if the bird is brown or plain, regardless of the c allele. So, for each bird, the presence of B determines the color. So:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of B?\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes\nCheckered brown | Yes\nPlain red | No\nPlain brown | No\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios depend solely on the presence of B. Since the B locus is independent of C, the presence of B is independent of the pigment color. Thus, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering the proportion of birds with B present versus those without.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of birds with B present (brown) is higher than those without (plain). Specifically, the proportion of brown is 3/4, and plain is 1/4, because for each bird, B is present (brown) in 3/4 cases (B_B_, B_bb) and absent (b_bb).\n\nHowever, within the F2, some of these are also checkered based on the c allele. Since the checkered pattern is always present when c is present, regardless of B, the phenotypic ratios would reflect both factors.\n\nTo calculate the exact numbers, let's assume that the population is large enough to ignore frequencies close to zero. The F2 generation has the following distribution:\n\n- 25% CC (pigs red, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs red, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs red, B present)\n- 25% cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% cc (pigs plain, B present)\n\nWait, this seems off. Let me correct the breakdown. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor each of these, the B locus breaks them into two categories:\n\n- For CC and Cc (pigmented red):\n   - B present (B_B_ or B_bb): 3/4 of the time\n   - B absent (bb): 1/4 of the time\n- For cc (plain):\n   - B present (B_B_): 3/4 of the time\n   - B absent (bb): 1/4 of the time\n\nThus, the overall frequencies for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: Always present when c is present, so for the pigened red (CC and Cc), the proportion is (number of Cc individuals * 100%) \u2192 50% of the population is Cc (pigmented red).\n- Among Cc (pigmented red), 3/4 have B present (brown), 1/4 have B absent (plain).\n- Among cc (plain), 3/4 have B present (brown), 1/4 have B absent (plain).\n\nTherefore, the total frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (c present in pigment, B present): 50% of the population (from Cc individuals)\n- Checkered brown (c present, B absent): 25% (from Cc)\n- Plain red (c present, B absent): 25% (from cc)\n- Plain brown (c absent, B present): 25% (from cc)\n\nWait, no. Because within Cc (pigmented red):\n\n- 3/4 of Cc have B present (brown): 3/4 * 50% = 37.5%\n- 1/4 of Cc have B absent (plain): 12.5%\n\nWithin cc (plain):\n\n- 3/4 have B present (brown): 75%\n- 1/4 have B absent (plain): 25%\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Checkered red: 37.5% (from Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% (from Cc)\n- Plain red: 75% (from cc)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from cc)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 37.5 : 12.5 : 75 : 25\n\nSimplifying by dividing each by 12.5:\n\n3 : 1 : 6 : 2\n\nWhich matches option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no, my calculation gave 37.5%, 12.5%, 75%, 25%, which simplifies to 3:1:6:2. But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Maybe double of our ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nThe F2 population has:\n\n- 25% CC (pigmented red)\n- 25% Cc (pigmented red)\n- 25% Cc (pigmented red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% Cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% Cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, that's 8 categories, adding up to 100%.\n\nNow, for each:\n\n- CC (pigmented red): All have B present (brown). So 25% are checkered red.\n- Cc (pigmented red): 75% have B present (brown), 25% have B absent (plain). So 75% of Cc are checkered red, 25% plain red.\n- cc (plain): 75% have B present (brown), 25% have B absent (plain). So 75% are plain brown, 25% plain red.\n\nCalculating the percentages:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC) + (75% of Cc) \u2192 25% + (75% * 50%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: 75% of Cc \u2192 37.5%\n- Plain red: 25% (cc) + (25% of Cc) \u2192 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%\n- Plain brown: 75% of cc \u2192 75%\n\nSo the ratio is 62.5 : 37.5 : 37.5 : 75\n\nMultiplying each by 8 to eliminate decimals:\n\n62.5 * 8 = 500\n37.5 * 8 = 300\n37.5 * 8 = 300\n75 * 8 = 600\n\nTotal is 500 + 300 + 300 + 600 = 1700 \u2192 Divide each by 100 to get percentages: 5, 3, 3, 6\n\nSo the ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 5 : 3 : 3 : 6 \u2192 Which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No, that's different. Wait, my calculation shows 5, 3, 3, 6. None of the options match exactly. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Instead of converting percentages to counts, perhaps I should sum the contributions directly.\n\nFrom CC (25%): 25% checkered red.\nFrom Cc (50%): 75% checkered red, 25% plain red.\nFrom cc (25%): 75% plain brown, 25% plain red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC) + 75% of Cc \u2192 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: 75% of Cc \u2192 37.5%\n- Plain red: 25% (cc) + 25% of Cc \u2192 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%\n- Plain brown: 75% of cc \u2192 75%\n\nSo the ratio is 62.5 : 37.5 : 37.5 : 75 \u2192 Simplify by dividing each by 12.5: 5 : 3 : 3 : 6.\n\nThis isn't listed as an option. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Close but checkered red is 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Our calculation shows checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 6. Option H says plain red is 2, which doesn't match our 37.5% plain red.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify:\n\nTotal population:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nWithin each:\n\nCC (pigmented red): All have B present \u2192 25% checkered red.\n\nCc (pigmented red): 75% have B present \u2192 37.5% checkered red, 12.5% plain red.\n\ncc (plain): 75% have B present \u2192 56.25% plain brown, 25% plain red.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me structure it better:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC (25%):\n   - B present: 100% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (50%):\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Checkered red\n   - B absent: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- Cc (another 50%):\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Checkered red\n   - B absent: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc (25%):\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Plain brown\n   - B absent: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, adding up the contributions:\n\nCheckered red:\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25%\n- Cc: 50% * 75% = 37.5% \u2192 Total 62.5%\n\nCheckered brown:\n- Cc: 50% * 25% = 12.5% \u2192 Total 12.5%\n\nPlain red:\n- Cc: 50% * 25% = 12.5% \u2192 Plus cc: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Total 18.75%\n\nWait, that can't be right because adding 62.5 + 12.5 + 18.75 = 93.75, leaving 6.25% for plain brown.\n\nWait, no, the breakdown should be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) + Cc (50% * 75%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50% * 25%) = 12.5%\n- Plain red: Cc (50% * 25%) + cc (25% * 25%) = 12.5% + 6.25% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: cc (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n\nNow, adding these together: 62.5 + 12.5 + 18.75 + 18.75 = 112.5%, which exceeds 100%. I must have made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me correct the breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) + Cc (50% * 75%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50% * 25%) = ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. However, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, implying that the presence of c results in a checkered pattern regardless of the pigment color. Similarly, the presence of b results in plain body regardless of the color. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a distinct phenotype from the regular pigmented ones. Hmm, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me consider that:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C or c) and body color (B or b). The phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and B is present (brown) or not (checkered). However, the checkered pattern is a separate phenotype, so a bird could have a checkered body regardless of the pigment color. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of c makes it checkered, while any other combination makes it plain. But the problem says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C,\" implying that C is dominant, so c leads to checkered. Similarly, brown is controlled by B, with b being recessive (plain). So each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented red (C_B_)\n- Pigmented brown (C_bb)\n- Plain red (cc_B_)\n- Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nWait, but in reality, it's more accurate to say:\n\n- Checkered: due to the c allele at the pigment gene.\n- Plain: due to the c allele at the pigment gene.\n- Brown: depends on B. If B is present, it's brown; if absent, it's plain.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, so perhaps the presence of c causes the checkered pattern, but whether it's brown or plain depends on another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the B and c alleles determine the color. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a separate phenotype, and the color is determined by the B and b alleles. So, if B is present, the bird is brown, else plain. The checkered pattern is always present regardless of B. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: c (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Checkered brown: c and b (brown)\n- Plain red: cc (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Plain brown: cc and b\n\nSo the four phenotypes. Now, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, I'll need to determine how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation. To do this, I'll use the standard Mendelian dihybrid cross approach, calculating the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible genotypes in the F2 generation. From the F1, which is CcBb, selfing produces F2 with four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Wait, no\u2014when you self CcBb, you get four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But since C and B are independent, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25% (since CB contributes C and B, cb contributes c and b \u2192 Cc)\n- Cc (same as above)\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, to combine these, considering the independence of the genes, the overall phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C) and body color (B). The phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented red: C is present (either C_B_ or C_bb)\n- Pigmented brown: C is present (C_B_ or C_bb) \u2192 same as above\n- Plain red: c (dominant) in pigment (so cc) combined with B present (B_) \u2192 cc_B_\n- Plain brown: c (dominant) in pigment (cc) combined with B present (B_) \u2192 cc_b_\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, which suggests that c in the pigment gene makes it checkered, and the color (brown or plain) is determined by the B locus. So perhaps the checkered pattern is always present, regardless of the color. That would mean:\n\n- Checkered red: c (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Checkered brown: c (pigment) and b (brown)\n- Plain red: cc (pigment) and B (brown)\n- Plain brown: cc (pigment) and b (brown)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes correspond to the presence of c (checkered) and the presence of B (brown). Now, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, I need to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles that lead to each phenotype.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - Pigmented red (since C is present)\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - Pigmented red (C present)\n3. Cc (50%):\n   - Pigmented red (C present)\n4. cc (25%):\n   - Plain red (only cc, no C present)\n\nWait, but this doesn't account for the B locus. Actually, the presence of B determines if the bird is brown or plain, regardless of the c allele. So, for each bird, the presence of B determines the color. So:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of B?\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes\nCheckered brown | Yes\nPlain red | No\nPlain brown | No\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios depend solely on the presence of B. Since the B locus is independent of C, the presence of B is independent of the pigment color. Thus, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering the proportion of birds with B present versus those without.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of birds with B present (brown) is higher than those without (plain). Specifically, the proportion of brown is 3/4, and plain is 1/4, because for each bird, B is present (brown) in 3/4 cases (B_B_, B_bb) and absent (b_bb).\n\nHowever, within the F2, some of these are also checkered based on the c allele. Since the checkered pattern is always present when c is present, regardless of B, the phenotypic ratios would reflect both factors.\n\nTo calculate the exact numbers, let's assume that the population is large enough to ignore frequencies close to zero. The F2 generation has the following distribution:\n\n- 25% CC (pigs red, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs red, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs red, B present)\n- 25% cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% Cc (pigs plain, B present)\n- 25% cc (pigs plain, B present)\n\nWait, this seems off. Let me correct the breakdown. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor each of these, the B locus breaks them into two categories:\n\n- For CC and Cc (pigmented red):\n   - B present (B_B_ or B_bb): 3/4 of the time\n   - B absent (bb): 1/4 of the time\n- For cc (plain):\n   - B present (B_B_): 3/4 of the time\n   - B absent (bb): 1/4 of the time\n\nThus, the overall frequencies for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: Always present when c is present, so for the pigened red (CC and Cc), the proportion is (number of Cc individuals * 100%) \u2192 50% of the population is Cc (pigmented red).\n- Among Cc (pigmented red), 3/4 have B present (brown), 1/4 have B absent (plain).\n- Among cc (plain), 3/4 have B present (brown), 1/4 have B absent (plain).\n\nTherefore, the total frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (c present in pigment, B present): 50% of the population (from Cc individuals)\n- Checkered brown (c present, B absent): 25% (from Cc)\n- Plain red (c present, B absent): 25% (from cc)\n- Plain brown (c absent, B present): 25% (from cc)\n\nWait, no. Because within Cc (pigmented red):\n\n- 3/4 of Cc have B present (brown): 3/4 * 50% = 37.5%\n- 1/4 of Cc have B absent (plain): 12.5%\n\nWithin cc (plain):\n\n- 3/4 have B present (brown): 75%\n- 1/4 have B absent (plain): 25%\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Checkered red: 37.5% (from Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% (from Cc)\n- Plain red: 75% (from cc)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from cc)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 37.5 : 12.5 : 75 : 25\n\nSimplifying by dividing each by 12.5:\n\n3 : 1 : 6 : 2\n\nWhich matches option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no, my calculation gave 37.5%, 12.5%, 75%, 25%, which simplifies to 3:1:6:2. But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Maybe double of our ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nThe F2 population has:\n\n- 25% CC (pigmented red)\n- 25% Cc (pigmented red)\n- 25% Cc (pigmented red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% Cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% Cc (plain)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, that's 8 categories, adding up to 100%.\n\nNow, for each:\n\n- CC (pigmented red): All have B present (brown). So 25% are checkered red.\n- Cc (pigmented red): 75% have B present (brown), 25% have B absent (plain). So 75% of Cc are checkered red, 25% plain red.\n- cc (plain): 75% have B present (brown), 25% have B absent (plain). So 75% are plain brown, 25% plain red.\n\nCalculating the percentages:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC) + (75% of Cc) \u2192 25% + (75% * 50%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: 75% of Cc \u2192 37.5%\n- Plain red: 25% (cc) + (25% of Cc) \u2192 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%\n- Plain brown: 75% of cc \u2192 75%\n\nSo the ratio is 62.5 : 37.5 : 37.5 : 75\n\nMultiplying each by 8 to eliminate decimals:\n\n62.5 * 8 = 500\n37.5 * 8 = 300\n37.5 * 8 = 300\n75 * 8 = 600\n\nTotal is 500 + 300 + 300 + 600 = 1700 \u2192 Divide each by 100 to get percentages: 5, 3, 3, 6\n\nSo the ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 5 : 3 : 3 : 6 \u2192 Which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No, that's different. Wait, my calculation shows 5, 3, 3, 6. None of the options match exactly. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Instead of converting percentages to counts, perhaps I should sum the contributions directly.\n\nFrom CC (25%): 25% checkered red.\nFrom Cc (50%): 75% checkered red, 25% plain red.\nFrom cc (25%): 75% plain brown, 25% plain red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC) + 75% of Cc \u2192 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: 75% of Cc \u2192 37.5%\n- Plain red: 25% (cc) + 25% of Cc \u2192 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%\n- Plain brown: 75% of cc \u2192 75%\n\nSo the ratio is 62.5 : 37.5 : 37.5 : 75 \u2192 Simplify by dividing each by 12.5: 5 : 3 : 3 : 6.\n\nThis isn't listed as an option. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Close but checkered red is 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Our calculation shows checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 6. Option H says plain red is 2, which doesn't match our 37.5% plain red.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify:\n\nTotal population:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nWithin each:\n\nCC (pigmented red): All have B present \u2192 25% checkered red.\n\nCc (pigmented red): 75% have B present \u2192 37.5% checkered red, 12.5% plain red.\n\ncc (plain): 75% have B present \u2192 56.25% plain brown, 25% plain red.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me structure it better:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC (25%):\n   - B present: 100% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (50%):\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Checkered red\n   - B absent: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- Cc (another 50%):\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Checkered red\n   - B absent: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc (25%):\n   - B present: 75% \u2192 Plain brown\n   - B absent: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, adding up the contributions:\n\nCheckered red:\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25%\n- Cc: 50% * 75% = 37.5% \u2192 Total 62.5%\n\nCheckered brown:\n- Cc: 50% * 25% = 12.5% \u2192 Total 12.5%\n\nPlain red:\n- Cc: 50% * 25% = 12.5% \u2192 Plus cc: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Total 18.75%\n\nWait, that can't be right because adding 62.5 + 12.5 + 18.75 = 93.75, leaving 6.25% for plain brown.\n\nWait, no, the breakdown should be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) + Cc (50% * 75%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50% * 25%) = 12.5%\n- Plain red: Cc (50% * 25%) + cc (25% * 25%) = 12.5% + 6.25% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: cc (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n\nNow, adding these together: 62.5 + 12.5 + 18.75 + 18.75 = 112.5%, which exceeds 100%. I must have made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me correct the breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) + Cc (50% * 75%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50% * 25%) = ",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me list them:",
    "rollout": " Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c absent) and brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c absent) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo there are four phenotypic categories. Now, let's calculate the probability of each. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each category is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 100% (since it's dominant)\nWait, no\u2014if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will have pigment red. If a bird has two recessives, it'll have plain. Similarly for B: any bird with at least one B has brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nWait, but in our case, the parents are homozygous for both traits. Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B are dominant), and Parent 2 is cc bb (both recessive).\n\nIn a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to make F2.\n\nEach gene's effect is independent, so we can consider each gene separately and then combine the results. Let's handle each gene individually.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of being C (pigment red) = 100%, since both parents are homozygous for C.\nWait, no\u2014it depends on the parent's alleles. Parent 1 is CC, so he contributes C. Parent 2 is cc, so she contributes c. Thus, F1 (Cc) can produce either C or c. So the C locus in F1 is 50% C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (B):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) contributes B, Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes b. So F1 (CcBb) can produce either B or b. So B locus in F1 is 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet me create a table for all four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present) AND Checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c absent) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c absent) AND Checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are present:\n   - C present: 100% (since F1 is Cc, and in F2, the proportion of C is 3/4, but wait, actually, in F2, the C locus will have 25% C (c), 50% Cc (carries both), and 25% c. But since pigment color is determined by C, any bird with at least one C will have pigment red. Wait, but in reality, the presence of C is always present unless both alleles are c. So the chance of having pigment red (at least one C) is 3/4. Similarly, for B, the chance of having brown (at least one B) is 3/4. However, since the two loci are independent, the probability of both being present is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. But wait, looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are computed differently. Let me approach it another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each gene's contribution is considered separately. For pigment color, the F1 is Cc, so in F2, the phenotypic ratio for pigment color would be 3:1 (recessive: dominant). Similarly for B. Then, combining these, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where each term corresponds to the four phenotypes. Wait, but in reality, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio combines both. Let me clarify:\n\nThe four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of pigment and color. So, for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant: recessive). Since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios would be 3\u00d73=9, 3\u00d71=3, 1\u00d73=3, and 1\u00d71=1. So the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. \n\nBut looking at the options given, none directly say 9:3:3:1. However, some options might group them differently or represent the actual observed counts based on the number of offspring. Let me see what the options are:\n\nA.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c absent) and brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c absent) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo there are four phenotypic categories. Now, let's calculate the probability of each. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each category is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 100% (since it's dominant)\nWait, no\u2014if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will have pigment red. If a bird has two recessives, it'll have plain. Similarly for B: any bird with at least one B has brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nWait, but in our case, the parents are homozygous for both traits. Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B are dominant), and Parent 2 is cc bb (both recessive).\n\nIn a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to make F2.\n\nEach gene's effect is independent, so we can consider each gene separately and then combine the results. Let's handle each gene individually.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of being C (pigment red) = 100%, since both parents are homozygous for C.\nWait, no\u2014it depends on the parent's alleles. Parent 1 is CC, so he contributes C. Parent 2 is cc, so she contributes c. Thus, F1 (Cc) can produce either C or c. So the C locus in F1 is 50% C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (B):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) contributes B, Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes b. So F1 (CcBb) can produce either B or b. So B locus in F1 is 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet me create a table for all four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present) AND Checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c absent) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c absent) AND Checkered (b absent) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are present:\n   - C present: 100% (since F1 is Cc, and in F2, the proportion of C is 3/4, but wait, actually, in F2, the C locus will have 25% C (c), 50% Cc (carries both), and 25% c. But since pigment color is determined by C, any bird with at least one C will have pigment red. Wait, but in reality, the presence of C is always present unless both alleles are c. So the chance of having pigment red (at least one C) is 3/4. Similarly, for B, the chance of having brown (at least one B) is 3/4. However, since the two loci are independent, the probability of both being present is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. But wait, looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are computed differently. Let me approach it another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each gene's contribution is considered separately. For pigment color, the F1 is Cc, so in F2, the phenotypic ratio for pigment color would be 3:1 (recessive: dominant). Similarly for B. Then, combining these, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where each term corresponds to the four phenotypes. Wait, but in reality, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio combines both. Let me clarify:\n\nThe four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of pigment and color. So, for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant: recessive). Since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios would be 3\u00d73=9, 3\u00d71=3, 1\u00d73=3, and 1\u00d71=1. So the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. \n\nBut looking at the options given, none directly say 9:3:3:1. However, some options might group them differently or represent the actual observed counts based on the number of offspring. Let me see what the options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but according to 9:3:3:1, the sum should be 16.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 12, which doesn't add up to 16.\n\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nL. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nM. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nN. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nO. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 12.\n\nFrom my analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Because 9+3+3+1=16. Looking back at the options, option C matches this.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

For the C locus: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So in the F2, the proportion of C and c will be 3/4 C and 1/4 c. Similarly, for the B locus: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So in F2, the proportion of B and b will be 3/4 B and 1/4 b. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for both C and B being dominant. Similarly, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for C dominant, b recessive (Bb).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expressed trait. In this case, for pigment (C): C is dominant over c, so any C results in red pigment. For color (B): B is dominant over b, so any B results in brown color.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered red (9/16)\n- C present, B absent: Checkered brown (3/16)\n- C absent, B present: Plain red (3/16)\n- Neither C nor B: Plain brown (1/16)\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

So option D matches.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that the number of individuals would reflect the probabilities directly, but perhaps the actual counts depend on the parents' contributions. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of offspring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes and their frequencies in F2. Let me try that.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb (25%)\n2. Ccbb (25%)\n3. ccBB (25%)\n4. ccBb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotype for each genotype:\n\n- CcBb: Pigment dominant (C) \u2192 red; Color dominant (B) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb: Pigment dominant \u2192 red; Color recessive \u2192 plain \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBB: Pigment recessive \u2192 plain; Color dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Plain red\n- ccBb: Pigment recessive \u2192 plain; Color recessive \u2192 plain \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach genotype occurs at 25% frequency. Now, how many offspring are expected?\n\nAssuming 100 flies, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25\n- Checkered brown: 25\n- Plain red: 25\n- Plain brown: 25\n\nBut that sums to 100, which is correct. Now, comparing to the answer choices, none of them match this exact distribution except for option G, which is different. Option E has 3 checkered brown and 9 plain red, which seems off. Option A has 6 checkered red and 2 plain red, which also doesn't fit. Option J has 2 checkered red and 6 plain red, still not matching. Option C has 9 checkered red and 3 plain red, which adds up to 12, leaving 4 for the others, which isn't consistent. Option F has equal numbers, 4 each, which isn't what we calculated. Option H has 5 checkered red and 3 plain red, which is close but not exact. Option I has 7 checkered red and 5 plain red, which is also off. Option D has checkered red 1, brown 3, red 9, brown 3. Our calculation shows checkered red 25, brown 25, red 25, brown 25. None of the answer choices perfectly match this, but option D is the closest, possibly due to rounding or error in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the initial setup. The user might have intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question involves something else, like considering viability or other factors.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each gene is controlled by a dominant-recessive relationship, and the genes are assumed to act independently, the phenotypic ratios can be derived by considering the probability of each trait combination.\n\nLet me approach it differently. For the C locus: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So in the F2, the proportion of C and c will be 3/4 C and 1/4 c. Similarly, for the B locus: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So in F2, the proportion of B and b will be 3/4 B and 1/4 b. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for both C and B being dominant. Similarly, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for C dominant, b recessive (Bb). And so on. Wait, but actually, for each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C present (red)\n- C absent (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- B present (brown)\n- B absent (checkered)\n\nSo the four possible phenotype combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain red\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype combination depends on the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nProbability of C present = 3/4 (since F2 has 3/4 C and 1/4 c)\nProbability of B present = 3/4 (since F2 has 3/4 B and 1/4 b)\nThus, Probability of Checkered red = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nProbability of C present and B absent = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nProbability of C absent and B present = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nProbability of C absent and B absent = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that doesn't add up to 16 parts. Let me double-check:\n\nTotal = 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which works.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expressed trait. In this case, for pigment (C): C is dominant over c, so any C results in red pigment. For color (B): B is dominant over b, so any B results in brown color.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered red (9/16)\n- C present, B absent: Checkered brown (3/16)\n- C absent, B present: Plain red (3/16)\n- Neither C nor B: Plain brown (1/16)\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, 1+3+9+3=16, which adds up. But according to my calculations, checkered red is 9/16 (9), checkered brown 3 (3), plain red 3 (3), plain brown 1 (1). So option D matches.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that the number of individuals would reflect the probabilities directly, but perhaps the actual counts depend on the parents' contributions. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of offspring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes and their frequencies in F2. Let me try that.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb (25%)\n2. Ccbb (25%)\n3. ccBB (25%)\n4. ccBb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotype for each genotype:\n\n- CcBb: Pigment dominant (C) \u2192 red; Color dominant (B) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb: Pigment dominant \u2192 red; Color recessive \u2192 plain \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBB: Pigment recessive \u2192 plain; Color dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Plain red\n- ccBb: Pigment recessive \u2192 plain; Color recessive \u2192 plain \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach genotype occurs at 25% frequency. Now, how many offspring are expected?\n\nAssuming 100 flies, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25\n- Checkered brown: 25\n- Plain red: 25\n- Plain brown: 25\n\nBut that sums to 100, which is correct. Now, comparing to the answer choices, none of them match this exact distribution except for option G, which is different. Option E has 3 checkered brown and 9 plain red, which seems off. Option A has 6 checkered red and 2 plain red, which also doesn't fit. Option J has 2 checkered red and 6 plain red, still not matching. Option C has 9 checkered red and 3 plain red, which adds up to 12, leaving 4 for the others, which isn't consistent. Option F has equal numbers, 4 each, which isn't what we calculated. Option H has 5 checkered red and 3 plain red, which is close but not exact. Option I has 7 checkered red and 5 plain red, which is also off. Option D has checkered red 1, brown 3, red 9, brown 3. Our calculation shows checkered red 25, brown 25, red 25, brown 25. None of the answer choices perfectly match this, but option D is the closest, possibly due to rounding or error in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the initial setup. The user might have intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the question involves something else, like considering viability or other factors. But without additional context, I'll proceed with the assumption that the F2 phenotype distribution is as calculated above.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But since each bird is determined by two independent genes, the possible phenotypes are:",
    "rollout": " But since each bird is determined by two independent genes, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C c and B b)\n- Checkered brown (C c and B B)\n- Plain red (c c and B b)\n- Plain brown (c c and B B)\n\nWait, no. Because in reality, each bird is expressed by one of the alleles. So for pigment color (C/c), checkered is c, plain is C. For body color (B/b), checkered is b, brown is B. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C and B alleles), the phenotype depends on whether the bird is checkered or brown. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s about the alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered red: cB\n- Checkered brown: cc BB\n- Plain red: BB\n- Plain brown: bb BB\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: Pigment color (C/c) affects whether the bird is red (C) or plain (c). Body color (B/b) affects whether the bird is brown (B) or checkered (b). So each bird has two traits:\n\n- Pigment: C (red) or c (plain)\n- Body: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are four combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 Plain brown (bb B)\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes. Now, what's the probability of each? Since each gene is independent, the probability for pigment color is 50% red (C) and 50% plain (c). For body color, 50% brown (B) and 50% checkered (b).\n\nSo the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment present, body absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment absent, body present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment absent, body absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but looking back at the options given, none of them match exactly. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOptions A-G don't have four phenotypes equally represented. They have different ratios. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the genes interact differently. Wait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by c, while red is dominant C, and brown is dominant B. So the phenotypes are indeed based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nBut then why aren't any of the answer choices showing four phenotypes equally represented? All the options have four phenotypes, but with varying counts. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which matches a total of 16 birds. Similarly, option E is 3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16. Option G is 12,2,2,2\u2192 sum 18. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the Punnett square isn't leading to F2 directly as I thought. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself. So the F2 would involve the F1's gametes, which are CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 would have four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but actually, each parent contributes one gamete, so the F2 will have combinations like CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB, cb + cb. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n1. CB + CB = CcBb\n2. CB + cb = CcBb\n3. cb + CB = CcBb\n4. cb + cb = cc bb\n\nWait, that can't be right. No, wait, the F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CcBb\n- CB + cb: CcBb\n- cb + CB: CcBb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals have the same genotype except for the last one, who is cc bb. Wait, but that would mean only one bird is cc bb, and the rest are CcBb. But that's not correct because F2 should have four distinct genotypes, each occurring at certain frequencies.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nEach F1 can produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB: CcBb\n- CB + cb: CcBb\n- cb + CB: CcBb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals are either CcBb or cc bb. But how many of each?\n\nThe number of CcBb gametes is 2 (from CB and cb), and the number of cc bb gametes is also 2. But when F1 selfs, the F2 population consists of four individuals: two CcBb and two cc bb? No, wait, that's not right. Actually, the F2 would be formed by combining all possible gamete pairs, resulting in four F2 individuals, each being CcBb or cc bb. But the distribution depends on the number of ways each combination can occur.\n\nWait, no\u2014when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 includes all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. So the F2 would include:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals are either CcBb or cc bb, but depending on the number of each type, the frequency is determined by the number of ways each can be formed. Since each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes in a 50-50 ratio, the F2 would have:\n\n- CcBb: 25% (from CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB) \u2192 3/4\n- cc bb: 25% (from cb + cb) \u2192 1/4\n\nWait, but this seems off because the total percentage should add up to 100%, but 3/4 + 1/4 = 1. So in the F2, 75% are CcBb and 25% are cc bb.\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red (C)\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain (c)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown (B)\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered (b)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown (cc B)\n\nWait, but the last one is the same as the third. Wait, no\u2014because for B, brown is dominant, so if B is present (B), regardless of c, it's brown. If B is absent (b), then it depends on c. Wait, no\u2014if B is present (B), the bird is brown. If B is absent (b), then checkered depends on c.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (present) and B (present) \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. C (present) and B (absent) \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. c (absent) and B (present) \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. c (absent) and B (absent) \u2192 Plain brown (cc B)\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered red (cB), Plain red (BB), Checkered brown (cc B), Plain brown (cc B)\n\nNow, calculating their frequencies in F2:\n\nSince each trait is independent, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red (cB): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain red (BB): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown (cc B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown (cc B): same as above \u2192 25%\n\nAdding up: 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100%\n\nSo each phenotype is equally likely, at 25% each. But looking at the answer options, none of them show four equal phenotypes. Instead, the options list phenotypes with specific counts, like \"checkered red 1\", etc. This suggests that perhaps the F2 generation refers to a different scenario where the parents are not F1 but the F2 generation relative to the initial cross.\n\nWait, going back to the problem: the parent pairs are CC BB ( homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown). The question asks for the F2 generation. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated by crossing F1 with itself. So F2 genotypes are as discussed earlier, with 75% CcBb and 25% cc bb.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, the phenotypes would be 25% each, but none of the answer options reflect that. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nAll options sum to 16, which makes sense since the total number of birds in F2 should be 16 (since each cross is 16: 4 x 4).\n\nLooking at each option, let's see what the numbers represent. For example, option D says checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, plain brown is 3. That adds up to 16. Similarly, option B sums to 16, etc.\n\nNow, considering the dominance hierarchy:\n\nIn terms of pigmentation, checkered is recessive (c) and red is dominant (C). In terms of body color, checkered is recessive (b) and brown is dominant (B). So the phenotypes are determined by both traits, with each trait having its own dominance order.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes should follow the product rule of independent assortment. Each trait is inherited separately, so the combined phenotype is determined by the interaction of the two traits.\n\nGiven that, the four phenotypes would each occur with equal frequency in the F2 generation, but none of the answer options reflect that. However, looking closely, option F shows 4 of each phenotype, which aligns with equal distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the inheritance pattern. Let me consider another approach: using a Punnett square for F2 when starting from CC BB and cc bb.\n\nParental cross:\n\n- CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1 would be CcBb (all gametes CB and cb)\n\nF2 would be:\n\nFrom F1 gametes CB and cb:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals are either CcBb or cc bb. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, C is dominant over c, so CcBb would have C (so red) and B (so brown), making it Checkered red. cc bb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), making it Plain brown.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and plain by the dominant allele C. The brown color is determined by the dominant allele B, and checkered by the recessive b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: cB\n- Plain red: BB\n- Checkered brown: cc B\n- Plain brown: cc B\n\nWait, but that's overlapping. No, because:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown (cc B)\n\nEach phenotype's occurrence depends on both traits. Since the traits are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nProbability of Checkered red (cB):\n\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 0.5\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 0.5\nTotal: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly, Plain red (BB):\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 0.5\n- Body plain (b) \u2192 0.5\nTotal: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nCheckered brown (cc B):\n\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 0.5\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 0.5\nTotal: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nPlain brown (cc B):\n\nSame as above \u2192 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time in the F2 generation. But none of the answer options reflect equal representation among four phenotypes. The closest is option F, which states 4 of each phenotype. Let me check:\n\nIf the total number of birds in F2 is 16, and each phenotype occurs 4 times, then option F would be correct. Let's verify:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nThis fits option F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nHowever, looking back, the original problem specifies the parents as CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown). The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is derived from F1 selfing, which results in 75% CcBb and 25% cc bb.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis showed that in the F2, all 16 birds are either CcBb or cc bb, with each phenotype appearing 25% of the time. But option F shows each phenotype appearing 4 times, which would correspond to 25% each in a population of 16 birds. So option F is consistent with the expectation of equal distribution among the four phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the actual phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation, taking into account the actual genotype frequencies. But in this case, since each trait is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratios remain 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nAssuming the F2 population is 16 birds (as 16 is the least common multiple of 4 and 4, perhaps due to the way the parents were crossed), but actually, the F2 from F1 (which was 16) would result in 16 birds, each being either CcBb or cc bb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014because CcBb would have C (so red) and B (so brown), making it Checkered red. cc bb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), making it Plain brown.\n\nBut according to dominance rules, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C): presence (C) \u2192 red; absence (c) \u2192 plain.\n- For body color (B): presence (B) \u2192 brown; absence (b) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. C (red) and b (checkered",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. But since each bird is determined by two independent genes, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C c and B b)\n- Checkered brown (C c and B B)\n- Plain red (c c and B b)\n- Plain brown (c c and B B)\n\nWait, no. Because in reality, each bird is expressed by one of the alleles. So for pigment color (C/c), checkered is c, plain is C. For body color (B/b), checkered is b, brown is B. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C and B alleles), the phenotype depends on whether the bird is checkered or brown. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s about the alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered red: cB\n- Checkered brown: cc BB\n- Plain red: BB\n- Plain brown: bb BB\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: Pigment color (C/c) affects whether the bird is red (C) or plain (c). Body color (B/b) affects whether the bird is brown (B) or checkered (b). So each bird has two traits:\n\n- Pigment: C (red) or c (plain)\n- Body: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are four combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 Plain brown (bb B)\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes. Now, what's the probability of each? Since each gene is independent, the probability for pigment color is 50% red (C) and 50% plain (c). For body color, 50% brown (B) and 50% checkered (b).\n\nSo the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment present, body absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment absent, body present: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment absent, body absent: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but looking back at the options given, none of them match exactly. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOptions A-G don't have four phenotypes equally represented. They have different ratios. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the genes interact differently. Wait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by c, while red is dominant C, and brown is dominant B. So the phenotypes are indeed based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nBut then why aren't any of the answer choices showing four phenotypes equally represented? All the options have four phenotypes, but with varying counts. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which matches a total of 16 birds. Similarly, option E is 3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16. Option G is 12,2,2,2\u2192 sum 18. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the Punnett square isn't leading to F2 directly as I thought. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself. So the F2 would involve the F1's gametes, which are CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 would have four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but actually, each parent contributes one gamete, so the F2 will have combinations like CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB, cb + cb. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n1. CB + CB = CcBb\n2. CB + cb = CcBb\n3. cb + CB = CcBb\n4. cb + cb = cc bb\n\nWait, that can't be right. No, wait, the F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CcBb\n- CB + cb: CcBb\n- cb + CB: CcBb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals have the same genotype except for the last one, who is cc bb. Wait, but that would mean only one bird is cc bb, and the rest are CcBb. But that's not correct because F2 should have four distinct genotypes, each occurring at certain frequencies.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nEach F1 can produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB: CcBb\n- CB + cb: CcBb\n- cb + CB: CcBb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals are either CcBb or cc bb. But how many of each?\n\nThe number of CcBb gametes is 2 (from CB and cb), and the number of cc bb gametes is also 2. But when F1 selfs, the F2 population consists of four individuals: two CcBb and two cc bb? No, wait, that's not right. Actually, the F2 would be formed by combining all possible gamete pairs, resulting in four F2 individuals, each being CcBb or cc bb. But the distribution depends on the number of ways each combination can occur.\n\nWait, no\u2014when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 includes all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. So the F2 would include:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals are either CcBb or cc bb, but depending on the number of each type, the frequency is determined by the number of ways each can be formed. Since each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes in a 50-50 ratio, the F2 would have:\n\n- CcBb: 25% (from CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB) \u2192 3/4\n- cc bb: 25% (from cb + cb) \u2192 1/4\n\nWait, but this seems off because the total percentage should add up to 100%, but 3/4 + 1/4 = 1. So in the F2, 75% are CcBb and 25% are cc bb.\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red (C)\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain (c)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown (B)\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered (b)\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown (cc B)\n\nWait, but the last one is the same as the third. Wait, no\u2014because for B, brown is dominant, so if B is present (B), regardless of c, it's brown. If B is absent (b), then it depends on c. Wait, no\u2014if B is present (B), the bird is brown. If B is absent (b), then checkered depends on c.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (present) and B (present) \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. C (present) and B (absent) \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. c (absent) and B (present) \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. c (absent) and B (absent) \u2192 Plain brown (cc B)\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered red (cB), Plain red (BB), Checkered brown (cc B), Plain brown (cc B)\n\nNow, calculating their frequencies in F2:\n\nSince each trait is independent, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red (cB): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain red (BB): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown (cc B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown (cc B): same as above \u2192 25%\n\nAdding up: 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100%\n\nSo each phenotype is equally likely, at 25% each. But looking at the answer options, none of them show four equal phenotypes. Instead, the options list phenotypes with specific counts, like \"checkered red 1\", etc. This suggests that perhaps the F2 generation refers to a different scenario where the parents are not F1 but the F2 generation relative to the initial cross.\n\nWait, going back to the problem: the parent pairs are CC BB ( homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown). The question asks for the F2 generation. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated by crossing F1 with itself. So F2 genotypes are as discussed earlier, with 75% CcBb and 25% cc bb.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, the phenotypes would be 25% each, but none of the answer options reflect that. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nAll options sum to 16, which makes sense since the total number of birds in F2 should be 16 (since each cross is 16: 4 x 4).\n\nLooking at each option, let's see what the numbers represent. For example, option D says checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, plain brown is 3. That adds up to 16. Similarly, option B sums to 16, etc.\n\nNow, considering the dominance hierarchy:\n\nIn terms of pigmentation, checkered is recessive (c) and red is dominant (C). In terms of body color, checkered is recessive (b) and brown is dominant (B). So the phenotypes are determined by both traits, with each trait having its own dominance order.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes should follow the product rule of independent assortment. Each trait is inherited separately, so the combined phenotype is determined by the interaction of the two traits.\n\nGiven that, the four phenotypes would each occur with equal frequency in the F2 generation, but none of the answer options reflect that. However, looking closely, option F shows 4 of each phenotype, which aligns with equal distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the inheritance pattern. Let me consider another approach: using a Punnett square for F2 when starting from CC BB and cc bb.\n\nParental cross:\n\n- CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1 would be CcBb (all gametes CB and cb)\n\nF2 would be:\n\nFrom F1 gametes CB and cb:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo all four F2 individuals are either CcBb or cc bb. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, C is dominant over c, so CcBb would have C (so red) and B (so brown), making it Checkered red. cc bb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), making it Plain brown.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and plain by the dominant allele C. The brown color is determined by the dominant allele B, and checkered by the recessive b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: cB\n- Plain red: BB\n- Checkered brown: cc B\n- Plain brown: cc B\n\nWait, but that's overlapping. No, because:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red (BB)\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown (cc B)\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown (cc B)\n\nEach phenotype's occurrence depends on both traits. Since the traits are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nProbability of Checkered red (cB):\n\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 0.5\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 0.5\nTotal: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly, Plain red (BB):\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 0.5\n- Body plain (b) \u2192 0.5\nTotal: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nCheckered brown (cc B):\n\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 0.5\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 0.5\nTotal: 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nPlain brown (cc B):\n\nSame as above \u2192 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time in the F2 generation. But none of the answer options reflect equal representation among four phenotypes. The closest is option F, which states 4 of each phenotype. Let me check:\n\nIf the total number of birds in F2 is 16, and each phenotype occurs 4 times, then option F would be correct. Let's verify:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nThis fits option F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nHowever, looking back, the original problem specifies the parents as CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown). The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is derived from F1 selfing, which results in 75% CcBb and 25% cc bb.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis showed that in the F2, all 16 birds are either CcBb or cc bb, with each phenotype appearing 25% of the time. But option F shows each phenotype appearing 4 times, which would correspond to 25% each in a population of 16 birds. So option F is consistent with the expectation of equal distribution among the four phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the actual phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation, taking into account the actual genotype frequencies. But in this case, since each trait is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratios remain 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nAssuming the F2 population is 16 birds (as 16 is the least common multiple of 4 and 4, perhaps due to the way the parents were crossed), but actually, the F2 from F1 (which was 16) would result in 16 birds, each being either CcBb or cc bb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014because CcBb would have C (so red) and B (so brown), making it Checkered red. cc bb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), making it Plain brown.\n\nBut according to dominance rules, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C): presence (C) \u2192 red; absence (c) \u2192 plain.\n- For body color (B): presence (B) \u2192 brown; absence (b) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red (cB)\n2. C (red) and b (checkered",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown\n- Pigment red and body checkered\n- Pigment plain and body brown\n- Pigment plain and body checkered\n\nEach of these four combinations could occur depending on the alleles. Now, considering the F2 generation, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio under Mendelian inheritance. But since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where each category corresponds to one of the four possible phenotypic combinations.\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming that each parent contributes gametes in a 1:1 ratio (since each parent is homozygous for both genes), the F2 would have the following distribution:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence of C (dominant): 3/4\n- Absence of C (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Presence of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Absence of B (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n- Both C and B present: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both C and B absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypic categories:\n\n1.

Looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our calculation. Our calculation shows:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Pigment red and body checkered: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Pigment plain and body brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1. Let me look again. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, not matching. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching either. Option D seems to fit: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to my calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. So D matches this except for the numbers. Wait, no, option D says checkered red 1, which contradicts our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Wait, checking the problem statement again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So C is dominant, c is recessive. Similarly, B is dominant, b is recessive. So, for pigment color, C is red (dominant), c is plain (recessive). For body color, B is brown (dominant), b is checkered (recessive). So the phenotype order is Pigment red > Pigment plain, and Body brown > Body checkered. So the phenotypic order would be Pigment red with body brown being the most common, then Pigment red with body checkered, then Pigment plain with body brown, and finally Pigment plain with body checkered.\n\nIn terms of the phenotypic classes, the highest frequency would be the ones where both traits are present (painted red and body brown), followed by those where pigment is red but body is checkered, then those where pigment is plain but body is brown, and finally those where both are plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 should be approximately 9:3:3:1, but scaled up. If we assume each class occurs in proportion, then the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Let me see what the options are:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2013 sum 16, but different ratios.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2013 sum 16, but different.\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2013 sum 16, same as our calculation.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2013 sum 16, but reverse of C.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2013 sum 16, reverse.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2013 sum 16, all equal.\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2013 sum 16, some zero.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2013 sum 16, various numbers.\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2013 sum 16, varying.\n\nFrom our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But let me double-check the F2 generation. Wait, perhaps the F2 isn't the correct generation to consider. Because the user asked for F2, but the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the next generation after that. But I think I might have confused F1 and F2 generations earlier. Let me clarify. The cross described is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 (CcBb). Then, F1 selfs to get F2. So F2 is the F1 x F1 cross. Thus, the F2 would indeed have the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the answer should be option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 (C_B_, bb) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 (C_bb, bb) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 (cc_B_, bb) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 (cc_bb, bb) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but wait\u2014no, each bird has two traits. So the phenotype for each bird is determined by both genes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown\n- Pigment red and body checkered\n- Pigment plain and body brown\n- Pigment plain and body checkered\n\nEach of these four combinations could occur depending on the alleles. Now, considering the F2 generation, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio under Mendelian inheritance. But since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where each category corresponds to one of the four possible phenotypic combinations.\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming that each parent contributes gametes in a 1:1 ratio (since each parent is homozygous for both genes), the F2 would have the following distribution:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence of C (dominant): 3/4\n- Absence of C (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Presence of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Absence of B (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n- Both C and B present: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Both C and B absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (B absent) \u2192 3/16\n3. Pigment plain (C absent) and body brown (B present) \u2192 3/16\n4. Pigment plain (C absent) and body checkered (B absent) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut wait, the user provided options for the phenotypic ratio. Looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our calculation. Our calculation shows:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Pigment red and body checkered: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Pigment plain and body brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1. Let me look again. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, not matching. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching either. Option D seems to fit: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to my calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. So D matches this except for the numbers. Wait, no, option D says checkered red 1, which contradicts our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Wait, checking the problem statement again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So C is dominant, c is recessive. Similarly, B is dominant, b is recessive. So, for pigment color, C is red (dominant), c is plain (recessive). For body color, B is brown (dominant), b is checkered (recessive).

    "rollout": " Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probability of each combination.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. So the phenotype is a combination of both. For example, a bird could be red brown, red checkered, plain brown, or plain checkered. To calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider the probabilities of each trait separately and then combine them. \n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus:\n\nParent 1: CC (so always C)\nParent 2: cc (always c)\n\nSo F1 (from CC \u00d7 cc) will be Cc, with 50% chance of being Cc (since parent 2 is cc, so gametes are c, and parent 1 is CC, so gametes are C. So F1 is Cc).\n\nIn F1 (Cc), the probability of having C (dominant) is 50%, and c (recessive) is 50%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nParent 1: BB (so always B)\nParent 2: bb (always b)\n\nSo F1 (from BB \u00d7 bb) will be Bb, with 50% chance of being Bb.\n\nThe probability of having B (dominant) is 50%, and b (recessive) is 50%.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of each combination is:\n\nRed Brown (C_B): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\nRed Checkered (C_b): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\nPlain Brown (c_B): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\nPlain Checkered (c_b): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right because the order matters. Actually, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two traits. For example, the phenotype \"checkered red\" would require the bird to be c_b (checkered, because c is recessive, so plain; but wait, no\u2014if a bird has c in the B gene, it's plain, but the color is determined by B. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nWait, for the B gene, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So if a bird has B, it's brown; if it has b, it's checkered. Similarly, for the C gene, C is dominant (red); c is plain. So a bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B)\n2. Red Checkered (c_B)\n3. Plain Brown (C_b)\n4. Checkered Brown (c_b)\n\nEach of these corresponds to different genotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: C_B \u2192 C (C_ dominant) and B (B_ dominant)\n- Red Checkered: c_B \u2192 c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Plain Brown: C_b \u2192 C (C dominant) and b (B recessive)\n- Checkered Brown: c_b \u2192 c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n\nNow, since the genes are independent, the probabilities are additive across the two loci. So for each phenotype, the probability is:\n\n(Probability of C) * (Probability of B) + (Probability of c) * (Probability of B) + ... Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me rephrase. The probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait contributing to that phenotype. \n\nLet's take Red Brown (C_B):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) is 0.5 (since F1 is Cc, which is 50% C, 50% c)\n- Probability of B (dominant) is 0.5 (since F1 is Bb, which is 50% B, 50% b)\n- Therefore, Red Brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, Red Checkered (c_B):\n\n- Probability of c is 0.5 (since F1 is Cc, 50% c)\n- Probability of B is 0.5\n- So, Red Checkered = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nPlain Brown (C_b):\n\n- Probability of C is 0.5\n- Probability of b is 0.5\n- So, Plain Brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nCheckered Brown (c_b):\n\n- Probability of c is 0.5\n- Probability of b is 0.5\n- So, Checkered Brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nAdding these up: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.0, which checks out.\n\nBut wait, the user options don't seem to match exactly, but looking back at the answer choices, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, each phenotype is equally likely (25%), so the ratio shouldn't have any differences except for the count based on the number of offspring. Assuming a large population, the ratio would approach 1:1:1:1, but the given options suggest specific counts. Let me think about the actual F2 generation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 generation isn't the same as the F1. Let me correct my earlier thought process. The F1 is the first cross, which is a dihybrid cross. The F2 comes from crossing F1 (which is CcBb) with itself. So the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to dihybrid crosses. But the question specifies that we need to consider the phenotypes and their ratios after accounting for dominance and whether certain alleles are expressed.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the question seems to mix two scenarios: one where the parents are homozygous for both genes, and another where the parents are heterozygous for each gene. Let me reread the original question to make sure I understood correctly.\n\nThe question states: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nAh, now I see. So the parents are homozygous for both genes. That changes things. So Parent 1 is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and Parent 2 is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So when they cross, each parent will produce gametes: Parent 1 can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 can only produce cb gametes. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, with gametes CB and cb in equal numbers (25% each).\n\nWhen F1 selfs (F2 generation), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant): Checkered red\n2. CcBb (heterozygous): Checkered brown\n3. CcBb (heterozygous): Checkered brown\n4. cc bb (homozygous recessive): Plain red\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual F2 generation would include all possible gametes, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: only when both C and B are present (i.e., CC BB and CcBb)\n- Checkered brown: when C is present but B is absent (CcBb)\n- Plain red: when neither C nor B are present (cc bb)\n- Plain brown: when B is present but C is absent (but since C is recessive, perhaps this doesn't occur)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's possible to have B without C. So:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | CC BB | ?\n| CcBb | ?\n| Checkered brown | CcBb | ?\n| Plain red | cc bb | ?\n\nWait, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB and CcBb. Since C is dominant and B is present, both are red.\n- Checkered brown: CcBb (since C is present, B is absent).\n- Plain red: cc bb (both C and B are absent).\n- Plain brown: Not possible in this setup because B is present in CcBb, but since C is recessive, perhaps the phenotype is simply brown regardless of C. Wait, no\u2014because the B locus determines color, with B being dominant. If B is present, the bird is brown; if B is absent, it's plain. Wait, but in F2, some individuals might have c (C recessive) and b (B recessive), making them plain red, while others have c (C recessive) and B present (brown), making them checkered brown. And those with both C and B missing would be plain red.\n\nWait, but in the F2 cross described, the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have a 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Plain red\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nBut the user options don't have these exact percentages. Looking back, the options are A through J, each providing different ratios. Let's check the options:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a 9:3:3:1 but grouped differently. Option G suggests 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, which is not matching. Option H is 5:3:2:6, also summing to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which adds to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4, adding to 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, adding to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding to 16. None of these add up to 16, but perhaps they're normalized differently.\n\nWait, but the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown. But none of the options directly reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C (9:3:3:1).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches the typical dihybrid cross result. So the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probability of each combination.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. So the phenotype is a combination of both. For example, a bird could be red brown, red checkered, plain brown, or plain checkered. To calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider the probabilities of each trait separately and then combine them. \n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus:\n\nParent 1: CC (so always C)\nParent 2: cc (always c)\n\nSo F1 (from CC \u00d7 cc) will be Cc, with 50% chance of being Cc (since parent 2 is cc, so gametes are c, and parent 1 is CC, so gametes are C. So F1 is Cc).\n\nIn F1 (Cc), the probability of having C (dominant) is 50%, and c (recessive) is 50%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nParent 1: BB (so always B)\nParent 2: bb (always b)\n\nSo F1 (from BB \u00d7 bb) will be Bb, with 50% chance of being Bb.\n\nThe probability of having B (dominant) is 50%, and b (recessive) is 50%.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of each combination is:\n\nRed Brown (C_B): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\nRed Checkered (C_b): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\nPlain Brown (c_B): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\nPlain Checkered (c_b): (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right because the order matters. Actually, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two traits. For example, the phenotype \"checkered red\" would require the bird to be c_b (checkered, because c is recessive, so plain; but wait, no\u2014if a bird has c in the B gene, it's plain, but the color is determined by B. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nWait, for the B gene, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So if a bird has B, it's brown; if it has b, it's checkered. Similarly, for the C gene, C is dominant (red); c is plain. So a bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B)\n2. Red Checkered (c_B)\n3. Plain Brown (C_b)\n4. Checkered Brown (c_b)\n\nEach of these corresponds to different genotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: C_B \u2192 C (C_ dominant) and B (B_ dominant)\n- Red Checkered: c_B \u2192 c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Plain Brown: C_b \u2192 C (C dominant) and b (B recessive)\n- Checkered Brown: c_b \u2192 c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n\nNow, since the genes are independent, the probabilities are additive across the two loci. So for each phenotype, the probability is:\n\n(Probability of C) * (Probability of B) + (Probability of c) * (Probability of B) + ... Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me rephrase. The probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait contributing to that phenotype. \n\nLet's take Red Brown (C_B):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) is 0.5 (since F1 is Cc, which is 50% C, 50% c)\n- Probability of B (dominant) is 0.5 (since F1 is Bb, which is 50% B, 50% b)\n- Therefore, Red Brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, Red Checkered (c_B):\n\n- Probability of c is 0.5 (since F1 is Cc, 50% c)\n- Probability of B is 0.5\n- So, Red Checkered = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nPlain Brown (C_b):\n\n- Probability of C is 0.5\n- Probability of b is 0.5\n- So, Plain Brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nCheckered Brown (c_b):\n\n- Probability of c is 0.5\n- Probability of b is 0.5\n- So, Checkered Brown = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nAdding these up: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.0, which checks out.\n\nBut wait, the user options don't seem to match exactly, but looking back at the answer choices, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, each phenotype is equally likely (25%), so the ratio shouldn't have any differences except for the count based on the number of offspring. Assuming a large population, the ratio would approach 1:1:1:1, but the given options suggest specific counts. Let me think about the actual F2 generation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 generation isn't the same as the F1. Let me correct my earlier thought process. The F1 is the first cross, which is a dihybrid cross. The F2 comes from crossing F1 (which is CcBb) with itself. So the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to dihybrid crosses. But the question specifies that we need to consider the phenotypes and their ratios after accounting for dominance and whether certain alleles are expressed.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the question seems to mix two scenarios: one where the parents are homozygous for both genes, and another where the parents are heterozygous for each gene. Let me reread the original question to make sure I understood correctly.\n\nThe question states: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nAh, now I see. So the parents are homozygous for both genes. That changes things. So Parent 1 is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and Parent 2 is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So when they cross, each parent will produce gametes: Parent 1 can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 can only produce cb gametes. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, with gametes CB and cb in equal numbers (25% each).\n\nWhen F1 selfs (F2 generation), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant): Checkered red\n2. CcBb (heterozygous): Checkered brown\n3. CcBb (heterozygous): Checkered brown\n4. cc bb (homozygous recessive): Plain red\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual F2 generation would include all possible gametes, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: only when both C and B are present (i.e., CC BB and CcBb)\n- Checkered brown: when C is present but B is absent (CcBb)\n- Plain red: when neither C nor B are present (cc bb)\n- Plain brown: when B is present but C is absent (but since C is recessive, perhaps this doesn't occur)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's possible to have B without C. So:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | CC BB | ?\n| CcBb | ?\n| Checkered brown | CcBb | ?\n| Plain red | cc bb | ?\n\nWait, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB and CcBb. Since C is dominant and B is present, both are red.\n- Checkered brown: CcBb (since C is present, B is absent).\n- Plain red: cc bb (both C and B are absent).\n- Plain brown: Not possible in this setup because B is present in CcBb, but since C is recessive, perhaps the phenotype is simply brown regardless of C. Wait, no\u2014because the B locus determines color, with B being dominant. If B is present, the bird is brown; if B is absent, it's plain. Wait, but in F2, some individuals might have c (C recessive) and b (B recessive), making them plain red, while others have c (C recessive) and B present (brown), making them checkered brown. And those with both C and B missing would be plain red.\n\nWait, but in the F2 cross described, the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have a 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Plain red\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nBut the user options don't have these exact percentages. Looking back, the options are A through J, each providing different ratios. Let's check the options:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a 9:3:3:1 but grouped differently. Option G suggests 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, which is not matching. Option H is 5:3:2:6, also summing to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which adds to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4, adding to 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, adding to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding to 16. None of these add up to 16, but perhaps they're normalized differently.\n\nWait, but the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown. But none of the options directly reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C (9:3:3:1).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches the typical dihybrid cross result. So the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " So for pigment color: red (C present) vs plain (c absent). For body color: brown (B present) vs checkered (b absent). Therefore, four possible phenotypic combinations: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, to calculate the expected phenotypic ratios, I'll consider the inheritance patterns. Since the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), all F2 individuals will receive one allele from each parent. So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- From CC parent: always C\n- From cc parent: either c or c (so 100% c)\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s F1 selfing, so F1 is CcBb. Thus, F2 will have:\n\nFor C:\n- Half the F2 will have C (from CB gamete + CB gamete)\n- Half will have c (from CB + cb gamete)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Half will have B (from CB gamete + CB gamete)\n- Half will have b (from CB + cb gamete)\n\nBut since both genes are acting independently, the probabilities multiply. So the chance of having C and B is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4. Similarly, C and b: 1/4. c and B: 1/4. c and b: 1/4. Now, considering the phenotype, each combination leads to different phenotypes. \n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio would be based on how often each of the four combinations occurs. Since each combination is equally likely (all 25%), the phenotypic ratios would also be 25% each. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes dominance affects this. In this case, since the dominant allele is expressed fully, and the recessive is expressed fully, there won't be any blending of colors. So each phenotype would indeed occur 25% of the time. \n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption C:9:3:3:1\u2192sum to 16\nOption D:1:3:9:3\u2192sum to 16\nOption E:3:9:1:3\u2192sum to 16\nOption F:4:4:4:4\u2192sum to 16\nOption G:12:2:2:0\u2192sum to 16\nOption H:5:3:2:6\u2192sum to 16\nOption I:7:5:1:3\u2192sum to 16\nOption J:2:6:3:1\u2192sum to 12\n\nWait, but the sum of all options except F sums to 16, which makes sense because there are four phenotypes. So F seems to have 4+4+4+4=16, which matches. So option F would imply that all four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring 4 times out of 16, i.e., 25% each. That aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is through the number of each genotype leading to each phenotype. Let me compute the number of each genotype in F2:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have:\n\n- (CB x CB): CC BB (red, brown)\n- (CB x cb): CcBb (red, brown)\n- (cB x CB): CcBB (red, brown)\n- (cB x cb): ccBB (plain, brown)\n- And similar for other combinations. Wait, but no\u2014that approach might complicate things. Alternatively, since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 will have:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 50% C (from Cc)\n- 50% c (from cc)\n\nFor gene B:\n- 50% B (from Bb)\n- 50% b (from bb)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is 25%. Now, mapping this to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown\n- CC Bb: red, brown\n- cc BB: plain, brown\n- cc Bb: plain, brown\n- CC bb: red, checkered\n- CC Bb: red, checkered\n- cc BB: plain, checkered\n- cc Bb: plain, checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So the actual phenotypes are combinations like red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. Each of these four phenotypes corresponds to specific genotypic combinations:\n\n- red-brown: C_B_\n- red-checkered: C_bb\n- plain-brown: _ccB_\n- plain-checkered: _ccc_\n\nBut in reality, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If the bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it's red-brown.\n- If the bird has C and b (recessive), it's red-checkered.\n- If the bird has c (recessive) and B, it's plain-brown.\n- If the bird has c and b, it's plain-checkered.\n\nGiven that, each combination of alleles for the two genes leads to a specific phenotype. Since each of the four combinations (C_B_, C_bb, _ccB_, _ccc_) occurs at 25% frequency, each phenotype would have 25% of the population. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each of the four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, the only one that reflects equal distribution among the four phenotypes is option F, where each phenotype occurs 4 times out of 16, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut wait, none of the options explicitly say 1:1:1:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color: red (C present) vs plain (c absent). For body color: brown (B present) vs checkered (b absent). Therefore, four possible phenotypic combinations: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, to calculate the expected phenotypic ratios, I'll consider the inheritance patterns. Since the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), all F2 individuals will receive one allele from each parent. So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- From CC parent: always C\n- From cc parent: either c or c (so 100% c)\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s F1 selfing, so F1 is CcBb. Thus, F2 will have:\n\nFor C:\n- Half the F2 will have C (from CB gamete + CB gamete)\n- Half will have c (from CB + cb gamete)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Half will have B (from CB gamete + CB gamete)\n- Half will have b (from CB + cb gamete)\n\nBut since both genes are acting independently, the probabilities multiply. So the chance of having C and B is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4. Similarly, C and b: 1/4. c and B: 1/4. c and b: 1/4. Now, considering the phenotype, each combination leads to different phenotypes. \n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio would be based on how often each of the four combinations occurs. Since each combination is equally likely (all 25%), the phenotypic ratios would also be 25% each. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes dominance affects this. In this case, since the dominant allele is expressed fully, and the recessive is expressed fully, there won't be any blending of colors. So each phenotype would indeed occur 25% of the time. \n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption C:9:3:3:1\u2192sum to 16\nOption D:1:3:9:3\u2192sum to 16\nOption E:3:9:1:3\u2192sum to 16\nOption F:4:4:4:4\u2192sum to 16\nOption G:12:2:2:0\u2192sum to 16\nOption H:5:3:2:6\u2192sum to 16\nOption I:7:5:1:3\u2192sum to 16\nOption J:2:6:3:1\u2192sum to 12\n\nWait, but the sum of all options except F sums to 16, which makes sense because there are four phenotypes. So F seems to have 4+4+4+4=16, which matches. So option F would imply that all four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring 4 times out of 16, i.e., 25% each. That aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is through the number of each genotype leading to each phenotype. Let me compute the number of each genotype in F2:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have:\n\n- (CB x CB): CC BB (red, brown)\n- (CB x cb): CcBb (red, brown)\n- (cB x CB): CcBB (red, brown)\n- (cB x cb): ccBB (plain, brown)\n- And similar for other combinations. Wait, but no\u2014that approach might complicate things. Alternatively, since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 will have:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 50% C (from Cc)\n- 50% c (from cc)\n\nFor gene B:\n- 50% B (from Bb)\n- 50% b (from bb)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is 25%. Now, mapping this to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown\n- CC Bb: red, brown\n- cc BB: plain, brown\n- cc Bb: plain, brown\n- CC bb: red, checkered\n- CC Bb: red, checkered\n- cc BB: plain, checkered\n- cc Bb: plain, checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So the actual phenotypes are combinations like red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. Each of these four phenotypes corresponds to specific genotypic combinations:\n\n- red-brown: C_B_\n- red-checkered: C_bb\n- plain-brown: _ccB_\n- plain-checkered: _ccc_\n\nBut in reality, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If the bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it's red-brown.\n- If the bird has C and b (recessive), it's red-checkered.\n- If the bird has c (recessive) and B, it's plain-brown.\n- If the bird has c and b, it's plain-checkered.\n\nGiven that, each combination of alleles for the two genes leads to a specific phenotype. Since each of the four combinations (C_B_, C_bb, _ccB_, _ccc_) occurs at 25% frequency, each phenotype would have 25% of the population. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each of the four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, the only one that reflects equal distribution among the four phenotypes is option F, where each phenotype occurs 4 times out of 16, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut wait, none of the options explicitly say 1:1:1:1.

Assuming that each phenotype is equally likely, the correct answer would be F, as each of the four phenotypes would have equal counts.

Pigment recessive (c) and body recessive (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles from each parent.

Plain brown: c (50%) * b (50%) = 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, so each phenotype has a 25% chance. That seems too simple, but given the parents' genotypes, it makes sense. However, looking back at the options provided, some have different ratios. For example, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. If the ratio is 1:1:1:1, then each category should be equal. But none of the options match exactly unless scaled up. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the actual number of birds rather than percentages. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, but the answer choices seem to have numbers like 6, 2, etc., suggesting a larger population. Perhaps the actual number of offspring is 16, as in a typical dihybrid cross. Let me assume that each parent contributes 8 birds, leading to 64 offspring. Then, each phenotype would occur 16 times (since 64 / 4 = 16). But the answer choices don't reflect this scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done differently, such as considering the actual number of possible gametes. Wait, another approach: each parent produces four gametes. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce one type: CB. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce one type: cb. Thus, F1 is CcBb, which when crossed, produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each gamete is either CB or cb, each at 50% frequency. So F1 (CcBb) selfs, producing four types of F2: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. These correspond to the four phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Plain brown\n\nEach occurring 25% of the time. So if we consider the number of offspring, say 16, each phenotype would appear 4 times. But the answer choices don't align with this. Looking at the options, D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. Wait, that sums to 1+3+9+3=16. So if each F2 bird has a 25% chance, then expecting 4 of each would sum to 16. But why does option D have 9 checkered red and 3 checkered brown? That doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as I previously thought. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different cross setup. Oh wait, maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which when selfed, would lead to F2 as described. So the phenotypic ratios should indeed be 25% each, leading to 4 of each in a sample of 16. But the options don't include this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16 total\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16\n\nBut according to my calculations, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so each should have 4 in a sample of 16. However, option G says checkered red 12, which is 75%, which doesn't make sense. Option H says checkered red 5, which is even higher. So perhaps the question intended the F1 to be crossed instead of F2? Wait, no\u2014the question specifies F2. Hmm, maybe I misread the parents. Wait, the question says \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as analyzed. But the options suggest a different outcome. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the F1 phenotype distribution instead of F2. But the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\n- B: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nPhenotype combinations:\n\n1. C dominant (R) and B dominant (Br): Checkered red\n2. C dominant (R) and b recessive (br): Checkered brown\n3. c recessive (pr) and B dominant (Br): Plain red\n4. c recessive (pr) and b recessive (br): Plain brown\n\nThe probability of each is (probability of C dominant) * (probability of B dominant) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 for each phenotype. So each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Therefore, in a large sample, each would have approximately 25% occurrence. But the answer choices do not reflect this. They all have varying distributions. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both genes, but in this case, one parent is homozygous. So perhaps the actual F2 ratios are different. Wait, maybe I should construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nGiven the parents are CC BB (so both are homozygous for C and B) and cc bb (both homozygous for c and b), their F1 would be CcBb. The F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's not CB, cb, cB, cb. Actually, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For gene C: parent 1 is CC, so always C; parent 2 is cc, so always c. Similarly for B: parent 1 is BB, always B; parent 2 is bb, always b. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) can only produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: from CB + CB\n- Cc: from CB + cb\n- cc: from cb + cb\n- bb: from cb + cb\n\nBut considering independent assortment, each combination occurs at a certain frequency.

Cc: Checkered brown\n3. cc: Plain red\n4. bb: Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Assuming a sample size of 16 birds (to get whole numbers):\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly matches this.

But none of the options seem to state that. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Wait, the question says \"the checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Are these the F1 or the F2? Let me read again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.

Therefore, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But the options don't show this. Option F shows 4,4,4,4. So perhaps that's the intended answer. However, looking back at the options, option J has 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12, which doesn't fit 16. Option F is the only one with equal distribution, but none of the options seem to represent this scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the 25% and consider the actual number of possible F2 individuals. But in reality, the F2 would be 16, with each phenotype appearing 4 times. Therefore, the correct answer should indicate equal distribution. Among the options, only option F does that. However, checking the options again, none of them list equal distribution. Option J lists 2,6,3,1, adding to 12, which suggests fewer birds. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option F is the most plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment dominant (C) and body dominant (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and body recessive (b): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and body dominant (B): Plain red\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and body recessive (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles from each parent. Let's calculate each possibility.\n\nFirst, the C locus: The parents are CC (C) and cc (c). So F1 will have a 50% chance of being CC (c) and 50% chance of being cc (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: Parents are BB (B) and bb (b). So F1 will have 50% BB (B) and 50% bb (b).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered red: C (50%) * B (50%) = 25%\n2. Checkered brown: C (50%) * b (50%) = 25%\n3. Plain red: c (50%) * B (50%) = 25%\n4. Plain brown: c (50%) * b (50%) = 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, so each phenotype has a 25% chance. That seems too simple, but given the parents' genotypes, it makes sense. However, looking back at the options provided, some have different ratios. For example, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. If the ratio is 1:1:1:1, then each category should be equal. But none of the options match exactly unless scaled up. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the actual number of birds rather than percentages. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, but the answer choices seem to have numbers like 6, 2, etc., suggesting a larger population. Perhaps the actual number of offspring is 16, as in a typical dihybrid cross. Let me assume that each parent contributes 8 birds, leading to 64 offspring. Then, each phenotype would occur 16 times (since 64 / 4 = 16). But the answer choices don't reflect this scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done differently, such as considering the actual number of possible gametes. Wait, another approach: each parent produces four gametes. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce one type: CB. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce one type: cb. Thus, F1 is CcBb, which when crossed, produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each gamete is either CB or cb, each at 50% frequency. So F1 (CcBb) selfs, producing four types of F2: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. These correspond to the four phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Plain brown\n\nEach occurring 25% of the time. So if we consider the number of offspring, say 16, each phenotype would appear 4 times. But the answer choices don't align with this. Looking at the options, D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. Wait, that sums to 1+3+9+3=16. So if each F2 bird has a 25% chance, then expecting 4 of each would sum to 16. But why does option D have 9 checkered red and 3 checkered brown? That doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as I previously thought. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different cross setup. Oh wait, maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which when selfed, would lead to F2 as described. So the phenotypic ratios should indeed be 25% each, leading to 4 of each in a sample of 16. But the options don't include this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16 total\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16\n\nBut according to my calculations, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so each should have 4 in a sample of 16. However, option G says checkered red 12, which is 75%, which doesn't make sense. Option H says checkered red 5, which is even higher. So perhaps the question intended the F1 to be crossed instead of F2? Wait, no\u2014the question specifies F2. Hmm, maybe I misread the parents. Wait, the question says \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as analyzed. But the options suggest a different outcome. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the F1 phenotype distribution instead of F2. But the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\n- B: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nPhenotype combinations:\n\n1. C dominant (R) and B dominant (Br): Checkered red\n2. C dominant (R) and b recessive (br): Checkered brown\n3. c recessive (pr) and B dominant (Br): Plain red\n4. c recessive (pr) and b recessive (br): Plain brown\n\nThe probability of each is (probability of C dominant) * (probability of B dominant) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 for each phenotype. So each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Therefore, in a large sample, each would have approximately 25% occurrence. But the answer choices do not reflect this. They all have varying distributions. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both genes, but in this case, one parent is homozygous. So perhaps the actual F2 ratios are different. Wait, maybe I should construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nGiven the parents are CC BB (so both are homozygous for C and B) and cc bb (both homozygous for c and b), their F1 would be CcBb. The F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's not CB, cb, cB, cb. Actually, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For gene C: parent 1 is CC, so always C; parent 2 is cc, so always c. Similarly for B: parent 1 is BB, always B; parent 2 is bb, always b. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) can only produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: from CB + CB\n- Cc: from CB + cb\n- cc: from cb + cb\n- bb: from cb + cb\n\nBut considering independent assortment, each combination occurs at a certain frequency. Specifically:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThese correspond to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Checkered brown\n3. cc: Plain red\n4. bb: Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Assuming a sample size of 16 birds (to get whole numbers):\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly matches this.

For pigment (C):\n\n- C (red): 100%\n- c (plain): 100%\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (brown): 100%\n- b (checkered): 100%\n\nSince both genes are dominant-recessive, the probability for each trait is straightforward. The F2 generation will have a 1/4 chance for each phenotype combination. However, some combinations may overlap. Specifically:\n\n- The phenotype \"Checkered brown\" (C and b) will occur when the bird is C (from the C locus) and B (from the B locus). The probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n- Similarly, \"Plain brown\" (c and B) is also 1/4.\n- \"Checkered red\" (C and B) is another 1/4.\n- \"Plain checkered\" (c and b) is the last 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Hmm, let me double-check the calculations. Each gene is independent, so the combined probabilities multiply. For example, for \"Checkered red,\" it's (C from either parent) and (B from either parent). Since each gene is fully expressed, the probability is indeed 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 for each phenotype. Thus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, which translates to 1/4 each for four phenotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2014 summing to 16, which isn't 4 parts.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2014 summing to 16, which is 4:4:0:4, but our calculation shows 1:1:1:1.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2014 summing to 16, which is 9:3:3:1, typical of a dihybrid cross without any dominance issues.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2014 summing to 16, which suggests a trihybrid scenario, but we have only two genes.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2014 same as option C, but shifted.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2014 summing to 16, which is 4:4:4:4, indicating complete dominance and no blending.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2014 summing to 16, suggesting a different distribution.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2014 summing to 16.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2014 summing to 16.\n\nNone of these options match my earlier conclusion of 1:1:1:1. This suggests that perhaps the original analysis was incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a dihybrid cross where each gene's expression combines, leading to more complex ratios. But given the initial description, the simplest explanation is that each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't among the options provided. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2014 summing to 16. That would imply that one phenotype is twice as common as others. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2014 same issue. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 which would suggest a trihybrid situation. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied dominance. If both genes are required for a certain phenotype, then the number of individuals for each phenotype would differ. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf \"Checkered red\" requires both C and B (i.e., recessive c and recessive b), while \"Checkered brown\" requires C (dominant) and b (recessive). Similarly, \"Plain red\" requires c and B, and \"Plain brown\" requires c and b. In this case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of the recessive alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (for pigment) and b (for body) \u2192 phenotype: Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: C and b \u2192 phenotype: Checkered brown\n- Plain red: c and B \u2192 phenotype: Plain red\n- Plain brown: c and b \u2192 phenotype: Plain brown\n\nIn this scenario, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of recessive alleles for each gene. Now, the frequency of each phenotype would depend on the probabilities of having those combinations. For each gene, the probability of being recessive is 1/4 (since each parent gives a 1/2 chance for the recessive allele).\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\n- Checkered red (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Checkered brown (C and b): (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n- Plain red (c and B): (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\n- Plain brown (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8. Hmm, that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are based on the number of dominant vs recessive alleles rather than the actual genotypes. For instance, if a bird is Checkered red (c and b), it has 1 dominant (C) and 1 recessive (c) for pigment, and 1 dominant (B) and 1 recessive (b) for body. But this complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, leading to four phenotypic classes, each with equal representation in the F2 generation, thus a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't among the answer choices. Looking back at the options, option E says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers dominance in such a way that some phenotypes overlap or produce similar results. For example, if both genes are dominant, the phenotype is Checkered red; if one is dominant and the other recessive, it's Checkered brown; if neither is dominant, it's plain. But that still leads to the same 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the F1 cross isn't adihybrid but involves different combinations. Wait, the user described an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. The F1 \u00d7 F1 cross would yield the F2 generation. \n\nLet me recalculate the F2 phenotypic ratios properly. Using a Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C/B): \n  - C (red)\n  - c (plain)\n- For the body color gene (B/b):\n  - B (brown)\n  - b (checkered)\n\nThe Punnett square would have:\n\n- 25% CC (both C)\n- 25% Cc (C from one parent, c from the other)\n- 25% cc (both c)\n- 25% BB (B from one parent, B from the other)\n- 25% Bb (B from one, b from the other)\n- 25% bB (same as Bb)\n- 25% bb (both b)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake here. The F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. So the Punnett square would involve all possible combinations of these gametes. Each gamete has a 25% chance. So the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (probability 1/16)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (probability 2/16)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (probability 2/16)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (probability 1/16)\n\nSimilarly, the other combinations for the other letters:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations:\n\n- From the C locus: C (from CB or CB) and c (from cb or cb)\n- From the B locus: B (from CB or Bb) and b (from cb or bB)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me instead construct the Punnett square properly:\n\nParental gametes:\n- Parent 1: CB, cb\n- Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nPossible combinations:\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nEach of these has a probability of 1/4 \u00d7 1/4 = 1/16. So:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: 2/16 \u2192 1/8\n- cc bb: 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdditionally, what about the other phenotypes? Wait, I missed some combinations. Because the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, each parent can only give CB or cb. So the correct combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n- CcBb (2/16)\n- cc bb (1/16)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, the user mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" and \"genotype frequencies.\" Also, the F2 includes other possible genotypes like CcBb, but in terms of phenotypes, only three distinct phenotypes are present: Checkered red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown.\n\nHowever, according to the calculations above, the frequencies are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16 \u2192 approximately 0.0625\n- Checkered brown: 2/16 \u2192 0.125\n- Plain brown: 1/16 \u2192 0.0625\n\nSumming to 1/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Wait, that's only a quarter of the population accounted for. What about the other possible phenotypes?\n\nAh! I must have missed the Checkered blue phenotype, but wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered color is due to the recessive allele 'c' in the body color gene. So 'b' is for checkered body. Wait, no\u2014the problem defines 'b' as the recessive allele for body color, making 'b' checkered and 'B' brown. So the Checkered red phenotype is when both pigment and body are dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigmented color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n- Body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the four phenotypes based on the combination of these traits are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and brown (b): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and brown (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, but in reality, if the body color is brown (B) or brown (b), regardless of the pigment color, it's brown. Only when both are recessive (c and b) do you get plain brown. Similarly, when pigment is plain (c) and body is brown (B), it's Checkered brown.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratios should account for all these combinations. However, based on the previous calculation, the Checkered red and Checkered brown phenotypes are each 1/16, and Plain brown is 1/16, totaling 3/16. The remaining 13/16 would be for the other phenotypes, which don't exist in this scenario because there are only four possible phenotypes. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.\n\nActually, considering the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (1/16)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (2/16)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (1/16)\n- Additionally, what about the other possibilities? Wait, perhaps I'm missing some phenotypes. Oh, no\u2014the four phenotypes cover all possibilities, so the sum is 4/16 = 1/4, leaving 3/4 unaccounted for, which is impossible because there are only four phenotypes. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express the F2:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: 2/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAnd that's it. The other possibility is CcBb, which is already counted as Checkered brown. So the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Checkered brown: 2/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWhich adds up to 4/16 = 1/4. Wait, that leaves 3/16 unaccounted for. How come? Where does the third phenotype come from?\n\nAh, I see the error now. The user didn't mention a third phenotype. Wait, no\u2014the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B)\n2. Checkered brown (C and b)\n3. Plain brown (c and B)\n4. Plain brown (c and b) [same as 3]\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, each bird can express either brown or plain based on the body color, and red based on pigment. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B)\n- Checkered brown (C and b)\n- Plain brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown (c and b) \u2013 which is redundant, so effectively, three distinct phenotypes.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the four phenotypic categories reduce to three: Checkered red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown. With frequencies as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Checkered brown: 2/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWait, but that's three categories adding up to 4/16, which is 1/4. So, the fourth category is missing. Wait, that can't be right because each bird must fall into one of the four phenotypic categories. So perhaps I've miscounted.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's possible that the other combination of the alleles doesn't result in a distinct phenotype. For example, if an individual is CcBb, they exhibit Checkered brown. If an individual is ccBB, they exhibit Plain brown. Wait, no\u2014that's correct. So, the four phenotypes are indeed Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain brown, and Plain brown again. But that seems redundant. So, the correct categorization is three phenotypes: Checkered red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown. The frequencies would then be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Checkered brown",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Plain brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, each bird can be categorized into four phenotypic categories based on the combination of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (b): Checkered brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, but the last two are the same phenotype, just different colors. Similarly, the first two could overlap depending on the alleles. Alternatively, perhaps better to consider the four possible combinations of the two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and brown (b): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and brown (b): Plain brown\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's not accurate because the two traits might combine differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the four possible phenotypic combinations based on the two genes. Let me approach it systematically.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C present \u2192 red\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and brown (b): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and brown (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, but the last two are the same phenotype, just different colors. So the actual unique phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red\n- Checkered brown\n- Plain brown\n- Plain checkered\n\nNow, let's determine how often each appears in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each trait is determined by the proportion of each allele in the gametes. For pigment (C):\n\n- C (red): 100%\n- c (plain): 100%\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (brown): 100%\n- b (checkered): 100%\n\nSince both genes are dominant-recessive, the probability for each trait is straightforward. The F2 generation will have a 1/4 chance for each phenotype combination. However, some combinations may overlap. Specifically:\n\n- The phenotype \"Checkered brown\" (C and b) will occur when the bird is C (from the C locus) and B (from the B locus). The probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n- Similarly, \"Plain brown\" (c and B) is also 1/4.\n- \"Checkered red\" (C and B) is another 1/4.\n- \"Plain checkered\" (c and b) is the last 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Hmm, let me double-check the calculations. Each gene is independent, so the combined probabilities multiply. For example, for \"Checkered red,\" it's (C from either parent) and (B from either parent). Since each gene is fully expressed, the probability is indeed 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 for each phenotype. Thus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, which translates to 1/4 each for four phenotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2014 summing to 16, which isn't 4 parts.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2014 summing to 16, which is 4:4:0:4, but our calculation shows 1:1:1:1.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2014 summing to 16, which is 9:3:3:1, typical of a dihybrid cross without any dominance issues.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2014 summing to 16, which suggests a trihybrid scenario, but we have only two genes.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2014 same as option C, but shifted.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2014 summing to 16, which is 4:4:4:4, indicating complete dominance and no blending.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2014 summing to 16, suggesting a different distribution.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2014 summing to 16.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2014 summing to 16.\n\nNone of these options match my earlier conclusion of 1:1:1:1. This suggests that perhaps the original analysis was incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a dihybrid cross where each gene's expression combines, leading to more complex ratios. But given the initial description, the simplest explanation is that each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't among the options provided. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2014 summing to 16. That would imply that one phenotype is twice as common as others. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2014 same issue. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 which would suggest a trihybrid situation. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied dominance. If both genes are required for a certain phenotype, then the number of individuals for each phenotype would differ. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf \"Checkered red\" requires both C and B (i.e., recessive c and recessive b), while \"Checkered brown\" requires C (dominant) and b (recessive). Similarly, \"Plain red\" requires c and B, and \"Plain brown\" requires c and b. In this case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of the recessive alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (for pigment) and b (for body) \u2192 phenotype: Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: C and b \u2192 phenotype: Checkered brown\n- Plain red: c and B \u2192 phenotype: Plain red\n- Plain brown: c and b \u2192 phenotype: Plain brown\n\nIn this scenario, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of recessive alleles for each gene. Now, the frequency of each phenotype would depend on the probabilities of having those combinations. For each gene, the probability of being recessive is 1/4 (since each parent gives a 1/2 chance for the recessive allele).\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\n- Checkered red (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Checkered brown (C and b): (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\n- Plain red (c and B): (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\n- Plain brown (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8. Hmm, that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are based on the number of dominant vs recessive alleles rather than the actual genotypes. For instance, if a bird is Checkered red (c and b), it has 1 dominant (C) and 1 recessive (c) for pigment, and 1 dominant (B) and 1 recessive (b) for body. But this complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, leading to four phenotypic classes, each with equal representation in the F2 generation, thus a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't among the answer choices. Looking back at the options, option E says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers dominance in such a way that some phenotypes overlap or produce similar results. For example, if both genes are dominant, the phenotype is Checkered red; if one is dominant and the other recessive, it's Checkered brown; if neither is dominant, it's plain. But that still leads to the same 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the F1 cross isn't adihybrid but involves different combinations. Wait, the user described an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. The F1 \u00d7 F1 cross would yield the F2 generation. \n\nLet me recalculate the F2 phenotypic ratios properly. Using a Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C/B): \n  - C (red)\n  - c (plain)\n- For the body color gene (B/b):\n  - B (brown)\n  - b (checkered)\n\nThe Punnett square would have:\n\n- 25% CC (both C)\n- 25% Cc (C from one parent, c from the other)\n- 25% cc (both c)\n- 25% BB (B from one parent, B from the other)\n- 25% Bb (B from one, b from the other)\n- 25% bB (same as Bb)\n- 25% bb (both b)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake here. The F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. So the Punnett square would involve all possible combinations of these gametes. Each gamete has a 25% chance. So the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (probability 1/16)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (probability 2/16)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (probability 2/16)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (probability 1/16)\n\nSimilarly, the other combinations for the other letters:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations:\n\n- From the C locus: C (from CB or CB) and c (from cb or cb)\n- From the B locus: B (from CB or Bb) and b (from cb or bB)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me instead construct the Punnett square properly:\n\nParental gametes:\n- Parent 1: CB, cb\n- Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nPossible combinations:\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nEach of these has a probability of 1/4 \u00d7 1/4 = 1/16. So:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: 2/16 \u2192 1/8\n- cc bb: 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdditionally, what about the other phenotypes? Wait, I missed some combinations. Because the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, each parent can only give CB or cb. So the correct combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n- CcBb (2/16)\n- cc bb (1/16)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, the user mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" and \"genotype frequencies.\" Also, the F2 includes other possible genotypes like CcBb, but in terms of phenotypes, only three distinct phenotypes are present: Checkered red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown.\n\nHowever, according to the calculations above, the frequencies are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16 \u2192 approximately 0.0625\n- Checkered brown: 2/16 \u2192 0.125\n- Plain brown: 1/16 \u2192 0.0625\n\nSumming to 1/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Wait, that's only a quarter of the population accounted for. What about the other possible phenotypes?\n\nAh! I must have missed the Checkered blue phenotype, but wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered color is due to the recessive allele 'c' in the body color gene. So 'b' is for checkered body. Wait, no\u2014the problem defines 'b' as the recessive allele for body color, making 'b' checkered and 'B' brown. So the Checkered red phenotype is when both pigment and body are dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigmented color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n- Body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the four phenotypes based on the combination of these traits are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and brown (b): Checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and brown (b): Plain brown\n\nWait, but in reality, if the body color is brown (B) or brown (b), regardless of the pigment color, it's brown. Only when both are recessive (c and b) do you get plain brown. Similarly, when pigment is plain (c) and body is brown (B), it's Checkered brown.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratios should account for all these combinations. However, based on the previous calculation, the Checkered red and Checkered brown phenotypes are each 1/16, and Plain brown is 1/16, totaling 3/16. The remaining 13/16 would be for the other phenotypes, which don't exist in this scenario because there are only four possible phenotypes. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.\n\nActually, considering the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (1/16)\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (2/16)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (1/16)\n- Additionally, what about the other possibilities? Wait, perhaps I'm missing some phenotypes. Oh, no\u2014the four phenotypes cover all possibilities, so the sum is 4/16 = 1/4, leaving 3/4 unaccounted for, which is impossible because there are only four phenotypes. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express the F2:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: 2/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAnd that's it. The other possibility is CcBb, which is already counted as Checkered brown. So the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Checkered brown: 2/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWhich adds up to 4/16 = 1/4. Wait, that leaves 3/16 unaccounted for. How come? Where does the third phenotype come from?\n\nAh, I see the error now. The user didn't mention a third phenotype. Wait, no\u2014the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and B)\n2. Checkered brown (C and b)\n3. Plain brown (c and B)\n4. Plain brown (c and b) [same as 3]\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, each bird can express either brown or plain based on the body color, and red based on pigment. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B)\n- Checkered brown (C and b)\n- Plain brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown (c and b) \u2013 which is redundant, so effectively, three distinct phenotypes.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the four phenotypic categories reduce to three: Checkered red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown. With frequencies as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Checkered brown: 2/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWait, but that's three categories adding up to 4/16, which is 1/4. So, the fourth category is missing. Wait, that can't be right because each bird must fall into one of the four phenotypic categories. So perhaps I've miscounted.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's possible that the other combination of the alleles doesn't result in a distinct phenotype. For example, if an individual is CcBb, they exhibit Checkered brown. If an individual is ccBB, they exhibit Plain brown. Wait, no\u2014that's correct. So, the four phenotypes are indeed Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain brown, and Plain brown again. But that seems redundant. So, the correct categorization is three phenotypes: Checkered red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown. The frequencies would then be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16\n- Checkered brown",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the possible phenotypes are:",
    "rollout": " So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, body brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the probability of each allele being passed on is 50%. Assuming independent assortment, the probability of any specific phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C) and body brown (B) is (1/2) * (2/3), because for B, B is dominant over b, so the chance is 2/3. Similarly, the probability of having pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) is (1/2) * (1/3). Adding them up, we get four possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify. The B gene has two alleles, B and b. The possible genotypes are BB (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (checkered). So the phenotypes for B are brown (BB or Bb) and checkered (bb). The probability of having brown (phenotype) is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the time, either BB or Bb is present). Conversely, the probability of checkered (phenotype) is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the C gene, the possible genotypes are CC (red), Cc (red), and cc (plain). So the phenotypes for C are red (any genotype) and plain (cc).\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. \n\nFor Checkered red (C_B_):\n- Probability C is present (red): 1/2\n- Probability B is present (brown): 2/3 (since B is dominant)\nSo overall probability = (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3 \u2248 33.3%\n\nFor Plain red (Cc_B_):\n- Probability C is present: 1/2\n- Probability B is absent: 1/3\nOverall probability = (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6 \u2248 16.7%\n\nFor Checkered brown (c_BB):\n- Probability C is absent: 1/2\n- Probability B is present: 2/3\nOverall probability = (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3 \u2248 33.3%\n\nFor Plain brown (c_bb):\n- Probability C is absent: 1/2\n- Probability B is absent: 1/3\nOverall probability = (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6 \u2248 16.7%\n\nAdding these together: 33.3% + 16.7% + 33.3% + 16.7% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option D says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up because according to our calculations, checkered red is 33.3%, checkered brown is 33.3%, plain red is 16.7%, and plain brown is 16.7%. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that seems off because our numbers don't match. Alternatively, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The B gene: brown is dominant, so B/B or Bb are brown, while bb is checkered. So the probability of B being present is 3/4, and checkered is 1/4. Similarly, for C: red is dominant, so C/C or Cc are red, and cc is plain. So probability of C being present is 2/3, and plain is 1/3.\n\nThus, for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8 = 37.5%\n- Plain red: (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8 = 12.5%\n- Checkered brown: (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8 = 37.5%\n- Plain brown: (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8 = 12.5%\n\nThat adds up to 100%.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this exact breakdown. Wait, but maybe the options consider different calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the actual number of offspring rather than probabilities. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16 offspring, which is not matching the 16.7% expectation for each phenotype. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is less than expected. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum to 16. 5+3=8, 2+6=8. 8+8=16. Each phenotype has a higher count than expected. Option A: 6,2,6,2. That's 16, but in reality, each should be around 4. So perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers all possible combinations without considering dominance probabilities. If each bird can produce gametes regardless of dominance, then the Punnett square would show 16 possible outcomes. In that case, each outcome corresponds to a specific phenotype based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's see: F1 is CcBb. It can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb, then the F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (25% each). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, it produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%. So the F2 would have 16 combinations. Let's list them:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cB \u00d7 cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that's only four outcomes, right? Because each F1 gamete combines with another F1 gamete. Let me correct that. Actually, each F1 can produce four gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. Let's list them systematically:\n\nGametes from F1: CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cB + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cB + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that's 16 outcomes. Now, how many of each phenotype?\n\nCheckered red: All except when both are plain. From the above, the only plain phenotype is when both are plain, which is ccbb. How many times does ccbb occur? Only once, when both F1 gametes are cb. So frequency is 1 out of 16. Similarly, plain brown occurs once, same reasoning.\n\nCheckered red occurs 15 times, but wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let's recount:\n\nEach of the first five cases where both F1 gametes are CB or cb leads to Checkered red. Wait, no, each combination results in Checkered red. Let me count:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CB + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n4. CB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n5. cb + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n6. cb + cb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cB + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cb + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n10. cb + cb \u2192 Plain brown\n11. cB + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n12. cB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n13. cb + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n14. cb + cb \u2192 Plain brown\n15. cB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n16. cb + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n\nWait, that's 15 Checkered red and 1 Plain brown? That can't be right because there are also some Checkered red cases when one gamete is CB and the other is cB. Wait, no\u2014it's always Checkered red unless both are cb. So, the only plain brown is when both are cb. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 15\n- Plain brown: 1\nBut that totals 16, which matches. However, in reality, when both F1 gametes are CB, the offspring is CcBb, which is Checkered red. Similarly, any combination where at least one allele is dominant for C or B will result in Checkered red. Only when both are cb will it be plain brown. So, the phenotype distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 15\n- Plain brown: 1\nTotal 16.\n\nBut the options given don't include such a high ratio. Looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 16 as well, but with different counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified, considering only the number of viable offspring instead of phenotypic ratios. But that wouldn't make sense because the problem asks for phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the problem assumes that all possible gametes are produced, including those with incomplete dominance or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach, such as counting the number of each type of genotype and then determining the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is approximately 3:1 for each trait, leading to four phenotypes. But none of the options perfectly reflect that. Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the ratio of checkered vs plain for each trait separately.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So, the options likely expect the correct phenotypic ratio among the four phenotypes, expressed numerically.\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, the correct ratio should be approximately 3:1:3:1, but none of the options exactly match that. Let's review the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16, but phenotypic ratio 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which is what we expect.\nB. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 same as A.\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 16, ratio 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which suggests that B is undercounted.\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum 16, which is 1:3:9:3, implying a different distribution.\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16, which is 3:9:1:3 \u2192 similar to option C but reversed.\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 sum 16, suggesting equal distribution.\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16, but implies that two phenotypes have zero counts, which isn't correct.\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16, which is 5:3:2:6 \u2192 unlikely.\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 7:5:1:3 \u2192 unlikely.\n\nFrom this, option A (6,2,6,2) and option B (6,2,6,2) suggest a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which is consistent with the expected Mendelian ratios. However, the phrasing in the options varies. Option A states checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This could correspond to 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, totaling 16.\n\nAnother possibility is that the options are considering the number of each genotype rather than phenotypes, but that doesn't seem to fit since the question specifically mentions phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the number of each phenotype relative to the total, but without further context, it's hard to say. Given that option A and B both represent a 3:1:3:1 ratio, and none of the other options match, I'll choose option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, body brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the probability of each allele being passed on is 50%. Assuming independent assortment, the probability of any specific phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C) and body brown (B) is (1/2) * (2/3), because for B, B is dominant over b, so the chance is 2/3. Similarly, the probability of having pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) is (1/2) * (1/3). Adding them up, we get four possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify. The B gene has two alleles, B and b. The possible genotypes are BB (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (checkered). So the phenotypes for B are brown (BB or Bb) and checkered (bb). The probability of having brown (phenotype) is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the time, either BB or Bb is present). Conversely, the probability of checkered (phenotype) is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the C gene, the possible genotypes are CC (red), Cc (red), and cc (plain). So the phenotypes for C are red (any genotype) and plain (cc).\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. \n\nFor Checkered red (C_B_):\n- Probability C is present (red): 1/2\n- Probability B is present (brown): 2/3 (since B is dominant)\nSo overall probability = (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3 \u2248 33.3%\n\nFor Plain red (Cc_B_):\n- Probability C is present: 1/2\n- Probability B is absent: 1/3\nOverall probability = (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6 \u2248 16.7%\n\nFor Checkered brown (c_BB):\n- Probability C is absent: 1/2\n- Probability B is present: 2/3\nOverall probability = (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3 \u2248 33.3%\n\nFor Plain brown (c_bb):\n- Probability C is absent: 1/2\n- Probability B is absent: 1/3\nOverall probability = (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6 \u2248 16.7%\n\nAdding these together: 33.3% + 16.7% + 33.3% + 16.7% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option D says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up because according to our calculations, checkered red is 33.3%, checkered brown is 33.3%, plain red is 16.7%, and plain brown is 16.7%. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that seems off because our numbers don't match. Alternatively, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The B gene: brown is dominant, so B/B or Bb are brown, while bb is checkered. So the probability of B being present is 3/4, and checkered is 1/4. Similarly, for C: red is dominant, so C/C or Cc are red, and cc is plain. So probability of C being present is 2/3, and plain is 1/3.\n\nThus, for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8 = 37.5%\n- Plain red: (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8 = 12.5%\n- Checkered brown: (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8 = 37.5%\n- Plain brown: (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8 = 12.5%\n\nThat adds up to 100%.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this exact breakdown. Wait, but maybe the options consider different calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the actual number of offspring rather than probabilities. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16 offspring, which is not matching the 16.7% expectation for each phenotype. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is less than expected. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum to 16. 5+3=8, 2+6=8. 8+8=16. Each phenotype has a higher count than expected. Option A: 6,2,6,2. That's 16, but in reality, each should be around 4. So perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers all possible combinations without considering dominance probabilities. If each bird can produce gametes regardless of dominance, then the Punnett square would show 16 possible outcomes. In that case, each outcome corresponds to a specific phenotype based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's see: F1 is CcBb. It can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb, then the F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (25% each). When F1 (CcBb) selfs, it produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%. So the F2 would have 16 combinations. Let's list them:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cB \u00d7 cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that's only four outcomes, right? Because each F1 gamete combines with another F1 gamete. Let me correct that. Actually, each F1 can produce four gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. Let's list them systematically:\n\nGametes from F1: CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cB + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cB + CB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cB = CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cb + cb = ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that's 16 outcomes. Now, how many of each phenotype?\n\nCheckered red: All except when both are plain. From the above, the only plain phenotype is when both are plain, which is ccbb. How many times does ccbb occur? Only once, when both F1 gametes are cb. So frequency is 1 out of 16. Similarly, plain brown occurs once, same reasoning.\n\nCheckered red occurs 15 times, but wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let's recount:\n\nEach of the first five cases where both F1 gametes are CB or cb leads to Checkered red. Wait, no, each combination results in Checkered red. Let me count:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CB + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n4. CB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n5. cb + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n6. cb + cb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cB + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cb + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n10. cb + cb \u2192 Plain brown\n11. cB + CB \u2192 Checkered red\n12. cB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n13. cb + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n14. cb + cb \u2192 Plain brown\n15. cB + cb \u2192 Checkered red\n16. cb + cB \u2192 Checkered red\n\nWait, that's 15 Checkered red and 1 Plain brown? That can't be right because there are also some Checkered red cases when one gamete is CB and the other is cB. Wait, no\u2014it's always Checkered red unless both are cb. So, the only plain brown is when both are cb. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 15\n- Plain brown: 1\nBut that totals 16, which matches. However, in reality, when both F1 gametes are CB, the offspring is CcBb, which is Checkered red. Similarly, any combination where at least one allele is dominant for C or B will result in Checkered red. Only when both are cb will it be plain brown. So, the phenotype distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 15\n- Plain brown: 1\nTotal 16.\n\nBut the options given don't include such a high ratio. Looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 16 as well, but with different counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified, considering only the number of viable offspring instead of phenotypic ratios. But that wouldn't make sense because the problem asks for phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the problem assumes that all possible gametes are produced, including those with incomplete dominance or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach, such as counting the number of each type of genotype and then determining the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is approximately 3:1 for each trait, leading to four phenotypes. But none of the options perfectly reflect that. Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the ratio of checkered vs plain for each trait separately.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So, the options likely expect the correct phenotypic ratio among the four phenotypes, expressed numerically.\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, the correct ratio should be approximately 3:1:3:1, but none of the options exactly match that. Let's review the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16, but phenotypic ratio 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which is what we expect.\nB. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 same as A.\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 16, ratio 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which suggests that B is undercounted.\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 sum 16, which is 1:3:9:3, implying a different distribution.\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16, which is 3:9:1:3 \u2192 similar to option C but reversed.\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 sum 16, suggesting equal distribution.\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16, but implies that two phenotypes have zero counts, which isn't correct.\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16, which is 5:3:2:6 \u2192 unlikely.\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 7:5:1:3 \u2192 unlikely.\n\nFrom this, option A (6,2,6,2) and option B (6,2,6,2) suggest a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which is consistent with the expected Mendelian ratios. However, the phrasing in the options varies. Option A states checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This could correspond to 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, totaling 16.\n\nAnother possibility is that the options are considering the number of each genotype rather than phenotypes, but that doesn't seem to fit since the question specifically mentions phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the number of each phenotype relative to the total, but without further context, it's hard to say. Given that option A and B both represent a 3:1:3:1 ratio, and none of the other options match, I'll choose option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Now, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFor the C locus (p = probability of C being present):\n\nIn F2, the probability of having at least one dominant allele (C) is 3/4, since:\n\n- Probability of CC: 25%\n- Probability of Cc: 50%\nTotal for C: 25% + 50% = 75%\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (q = probability of B being present):\n\nProbability of at least one dominant allele (B) is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is p * q, where p is the probability for one trait and q for the other. Wait, no\u2014wait, each phenotype depends on both traits. So, for example, Red Brown (C_B_) requires at least one C and at least one B. Similarly, Plain Brown (cc_B_) requires at least one c and at least one B, and so on.\n\nSo, for each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown (C_B_):\n  - Must have at least one C and at least one B.\n  - Probability: (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Red Checkered (C_bb):\n  - Must have at least one C, but must have bb (i.e., at least one b).\n  - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Brown (cc_B_):\n  - Must have at least one c, but must have B (at least one dominant allele).\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Checkered (ccc_b):\n  - Must have at least one c and at least one b.\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding up these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

Alternatively, maybe the options are presented differently. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of numbers without denominators, like 9 red brown, 3 red checkered, etc. But according to the options, option G is 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown. That sums to 22, which contradicts our earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypic ratios. Maybe the dominant alleles determine the phenotype, but the counts are different. Alternatively, perhaps the actual counts are 9:3:3:1, but scaled somehow. Wait, another approach: in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype would be proportional to their probabilities. So, for each phenotype, the count is (probability) * total population. If we assume a large enough population, say 16 birds, then:\n\n- Red Brown: 9 \u2192 9\n- Red Checkered: 3 \u2192 3\n- Plain Brown: 3 \u2192 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1 \u2192 1\n\nBut the options don't list these exactly. Looking at the options, option G has 12, 2, 2, 6, which adds up to 22, which seems off. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also adds to 12. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which adds to 16. Option K is 1,3,9,3, same as D. Option V is 6,2,6,2, same as A. Option X is 7,5,1,3, same as I. Option Y is 5,3,2,6, same as T. Option Z is 7,5,1,3, same as I.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused something. Let me try again. The probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. So, if we take 16 birds, 9 would be checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the options directly match this. Wait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 22, which is too high. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also adds to 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, which adds to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, same as H. Option K is 1,3,9,3, same as D. Option L is 5,3,2,6, same as H. Option M is 12,2,2,6, same as G. Option N is 5,3,2,6, same as H.

Option U is 3,9,1,3, same as E. Option V is 6,2,6,2, same as A. Option W is 8,4,8,4, same as D. Option X is 12,2,2,6, same as M. Option Y is 5,3,2,6, same as H. Option Z is 7,5,1,3, same as I.\n\nThe correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G if it were 9,3,3,1, but since option G presents higher numbers than expected, perhaps I've misunderstood the scenario. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a simplified ratio, such as 3:1:1:1, but that doesn't fit either. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered bird has the recessive allele c, and the plain bird has the dominant allele C. The red bird has the dominant B, and the brown bird has the dominant b. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nGiven that, the correct F2 phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But looking at the options, none directly state this. Wait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 22, which is inconsistent with the 16 possible. Perhaps the options are presenting the ratio in a way that's scaled down, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 12+2+2+6=22, which is wrong.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4\u219216.\n\nOption K:1,3,9,3\u219216.\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192same as K.\n\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u219216.\n\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u219216.\n\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192same as H.\n\nOption M:12,2,2,6\u2192same as G.\n\nOption N:5,3,2,6\u2192same as H.\n\nOption O:7,5,1,3\u2192same as I.\n\nOption P:6,2,6,2\u2192same as A.\n\nOption Q:8,4,8,4\u2192same as D.\n\nOption R:12,2,2,6\u2192same as M.\n\nOption S:5,3,2,6\u2192same as H.\n\nOption T:7,5,1,3\u2192same as I.\n\nOption U:3,9,1,3\u2192same as E.\n\nOption V:6,2,6,2\u2192same as A.\n\nOption W:8,4,8,4\u2192same as D.\n\nOption X:12,2,2,6\u2192same as M.\n\nOption Y:5,3,2,6\u2192same as H.\n\nOption Z:7,5,1,3\u2192same as I.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1 except for possibly option G if it's 9,3,3,1, but it's phrased as \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions. Maybe the F2 generation isn't what I thought. Wait, the F1 is all CB, and the F2 would be the F1 selfing, which would give us four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CC BB, then F1 selfing would produce four types: CB, CB, cb, cb, but actually, each F1 bird can only produce one type of gamete because they're homozygous. So, each F1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and each F1 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would consist of:\n\n- From CF1 (CC BB) \u00d7 CB gametes: CcBb \u2192 F1 (but wait, no\u2014it's F1 selfing, so the F2 would be the F1 producing gametes, but since F1 is homozygous, it would produce only CB gametes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen F1 (CC BB) selfs, the F1 produces gametes CB, and since both parents are homozygous, F2 would be CcBb, but only through the F1's gametes. Wait, no, that's not right. Homozygous parents produce only one type of gamete. So, F1 (CC BB) produces CB gametes, and F1 (cc bb) produces cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, resulting in various genotypes, but the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but if F1 (CC BB) is selfed, the F2 would consist of individuals who are CcBb. But since the F1s are homozygous, the F2 would be formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to all F2 individuals being CcBb. But wait, no, that's incorrect. F1 (CC BB) selfs to produce F2, which would be all CcBb, but since F1s are homozygous, F2 would include all CcBb, but the actual F2 would be CcBb for each individual. However, in reality, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent contributes one gamete, so F1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB, and F1 (cc bb) can only contribute cb. Therefore, F2 would be CcBb from each F1 bird, but since both parents contribute the same, the F2 would be CcBb. But wait, F2 would be the F1 (CC BB) \u00d7 F1 (cc bb), resulting in all CcBb. But since each bird is diploid, the F2 would have each bird contributing gametes from both parents. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should refer back to Mendel's laws. In F1 selfing, the F2 would have the same genotypes as F1, but the phenotypes would be different. Wait, no, F1 selfing leads to the production of F2, which includes all possible combinations. But in this case, F1 is homozygous, so F2 would be CcBb for each bird. But wait, no\u2014F1 is homozygous, so each bird can only produce one type of gamete. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of F2: CcBb, CcBb, cBcB, and cBcB. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Each F1 bird can only produce one type of gamete, so when F1 \u00d7 F1 happens, each bird produces one gamete. Therefore, the F2 would consist of four possible combinations: CcBb, CcBb, cBcB, and cBcB. But since the F1s are homozygous, the F2 would include all possible combinations. However, F2 would actually be CcBb for each bird, as both parents are contributing Cc and Bb. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me stop and proceed with the original approach.\n\nAssuming that the F2 generation results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options exactly match this, but option G states 12, 2, 2, 6\u2014which adds to 22, which is incorrect. Option J says 2,6,3,1\u2192sum 12, which is less than 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16. Option K is 1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3\u2192same as K.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. If the F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would involve the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered brown)\n- ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for pigment color: red or plain. For body color: brown or checkered. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cccc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined separately. So, the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment color: red or plain\n- Body color: brown or checkered\nThus, four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (ccc_b)\n\nEach phenotype will occur based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFor the C locus (p = probability of C being present):\n\nIn F2, the probability of having at least one dominant allele (C) is 3/4, since:\n\n- Probability of CC: 25%\n- Probability of Cc: 50%\nTotal for C: 25% + 50% = 75%\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (q = probability of B being present):\n\nProbability of at least one dominant allele (B) is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is p * q, where p is the probability for one trait and q for the other. Wait, no\u2014wait, each phenotype depends on both traits. So, for example, Red Brown (C_B_) requires at least one C and at least one B. Similarly, Plain Brown (cc_B_) requires at least one c and at least one B, and so on.\n\nSo, for each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown (C_B_):\n  - Must have at least one C and at least one B.\n  - Probability: (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Red Checkered (C_bb):\n  - Must have at least one C, but must have bb (i.e., at least one b).\n  - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Brown (cc_B_):\n  - Must have at least one c, but must have B (at least one dominant allele).\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Checkered (ccc_b):\n  - Must have at least one c and at least one b.\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding up these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. Wait, hold on\u2014I think I might have messed up the denominators. Because 9/16 is 9 parts, 3/16 is 3, 3/16 is 3, and 1/16 is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. That would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But looking back at the options, none seem to directly reflect this. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nB.8,4,8,4 \u2192 sum 24\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nG.12,2,2,6 \u2192 sum 22\n\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nL.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nM.12,2,2,6 \u2192 same as G\n\nN.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nO.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nP.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nQ.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nR.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nS.1,3,9,3 \u2192 same as E\n\nT.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H\n\nU.3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E\n\nV.6,2,6,2 \u2192 same as A\n\nW.8,4,8,4 \u2192 same as D\n\nX.12,2,2,6 \u2192 same as M\n\nY.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as T\n\nZ.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I\n\nSo, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

Option Z is 7,5,1,3, same as I.\n\nThe correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G if it were 9,3,3,1, but since option G presents higher numbers than expected, perhaps I've misunderstood the scenario. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a simplified ratio, such as 3:1:1:1, but that doesn't fit either. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered bird has the recessive allele c, and the plain bird has the dominant allele C. The red bird has the dominant B, and the brown bird has the dominant b. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nGiven that, the correct F2 phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But looking at the options, none directly state this. Wait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 22, which is inconsistent with the 16 possible. Perhaps the options are presenting the ratio in a way that's scaled down, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 12+2+2+6=22, which is wrong.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4\u219216.\n\nOption K:1,3,9,3\u219216.\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192same as K.\n\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u219216.\n\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u219216.\n\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192same as H.\n\nOption M:12,2,2,6\u2192same as G.\n\nOption N:5,3,2,6\u2192same as H.\n\nOption O:7,5,1,3\u2192same as I.\n\nOption P:6,2,6,2\u2192same as A.\n\nOption Q:8,4,8,4\u2192same as D.\n\nOption R:12,2,2,6\u2192same as M.\n\nOption S:5,3,2,6\u2192same as H.\n\nOption T:7,5,1,3\u2192same as I.\n\nOption U:3,9,1,3\u2192same as E.\n\nOption V:6,2,6,2\u2192same as A.\n\nOption W:8,4,8,4\u2192same as D.\n\nOption X:12,2,2,6\u2192same as M.\n\nOption Y:5,3,2,6\u2192same as H.\n\nOption Z:7,5,1,3\u2192same as I.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1 except for possibly option G if it's 9,3,3,1, but it's phrased as \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions. Maybe the F2 generation isn't what I thought. Wait, the F1 is all CB, and the F2 would be the F1 selfing, which would give us four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CC BB, then F1 selfing would produce four types: CB, CB, cb, cb, but actually, each F1 bird can only produce one type of gamete because they're homozygous. So, each F1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and each F1 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would consist of:\n\n- From CF1 (CC BB) \u00d7 CB gametes: CcBb \u2192 F1 (but wait, no\u2014it's F1 selfing, so the F2 would be the F1 producing gametes, but since F1 is homozygous, it would produce only CB gametes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen F1 (CC BB) selfs, the F1 produces gametes CB, and since both parents are homozygous, F2 would be CcBb, but only through the F1's gametes. Wait, no, that's not right. Homozygous parents produce only one type of gamete. So, F1 (CC BB) produces CB gametes, and F1 (cc bb) produces cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, resulting in various genotypes, but the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but if F1 (CC BB) is selfed, the F2 would consist of individuals who are CcBb. But since the F1s are homozygous, the F2 would be formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to all F2 individuals being CcBb. But wait, no, that's incorrect. F1 (CC BB) selfs to produce F2, which would be all CcBb, but since F1s are homozygous, F2 would include all CcBb, but the actual F2 would be CcBb for each individual. However, in reality, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent contributes one gamete, so F1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB, and F1 (cc bb) can only contribute cb. Therefore, F2 would be CcBb from each F1 bird, but since both parents contribute the same, the F2 would be CcBb. But wait, F2 would be the F1 (CC BB) \u00d7 F1 (cc bb), resulting in all CcBb. But since each bird is diploid, the F2 would have each bird contributing gametes from both parents. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should refer back to Mendel's laws. In F1 selfing, the F2 would have the same genotypes as F1, but the phenotypes would be different. Wait, no, F1 selfing leads to the production of F2, which includes all possible combinations. But in this case, F1 is homozygous, so F2 would be CcBb for each bird. But wait, no\u2014F1 is homozygous, so each bird can only produce one type of gamete. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of F2: CcBb, CcBb, cBcB, and cBcB. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Each F1 bird can only produce one type of gamete, so when F1 \u00d7 F1 happens, each bird produces one gamete. Therefore, the F2 would consist of four possible combinations: CcBb, CcBb, cBcB, and cBcB. But since the F1s are homozygous, the F2 would include all possible combinations. However, F2 would actually be CcBb for each bird, as both parents are contributing Cc and Bb. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me stop and proceed with the original approach.\n\nAssuming that the F2 generation results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options exactly match this, but option G states 12, 2, 2, 6\u2014which adds to 22, which is incorrect. Option J says 2,6,3,1\u2192sum 12, which is less than 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16. Option K is 1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3\u2192same as K.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. If the F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would involve the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered brown)\n- ",

    "chunk_removed": "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For example:",
    "rollout": " For example:\n\n- Pigment color (C): presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- Body color (B): presence (brown) or absence (checkered)\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypic combinations: \n\n1. Pigment red, body brown\n2. Pigment red, body checkered\n3. Pigment plain, body brown\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Absence (plain): 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): 3/4\n- Absence (checkered): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both present (red and brown): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment present, body absent (red and checkered): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment absent, body present (plain and brown): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both absent (plain and checkered): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but ratio seems different.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Ratios 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit our calculation.\nC. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Hmm, no, it's reversed.\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No, same issue.\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equally likely, which isn't our case.\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Again, not matching.\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Not our case.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the actual number of phenotypes rather than probabilities. But usually, phenotypic ratios are expressed in terms of counts, not probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the options are presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the phenotypes without accounting for dominance fully, but in reality, our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly matches this, except option J, which says 2:6:3:1, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering only the dominant phenotypes. That might change things. If we consider only the presence of dominant alleles, then:\n\n- Pigment red: any red allele (C present) \u2192 includes red and brown\n- Pigment plain: only when both C and c are recessive (c present)\n- Similarly for body color.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion of each observed phenotype, regardless of dominance. So our earlier conclusion of 9:3:3:1 is correct. But looking at the options, none directly reflect that. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, but our total is 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-express the F2 generation. The F2 would consist of all possible combinations of the gametes from the F1, which itself is CcBb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% chance)\n- CC Bb (25% chance)\n- cc BB (25% chance)\n- cc Bb (25% chance)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C present), Body brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C present), Body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain (c present), Body brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain (c present), Body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\nEach of these four genotypes has a 25% chance. Among them:\n\n- Checkered red (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Checkered red\n- Plain red (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Plain red\n- Checkered brown (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Checkered brown\n- Plain brown (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but weighted by their occurrence in F2. Wait, but the F2 generation consists of 100% of the four possible genotypes, each occurring once. So the ratio is 1:1:1:1, i.e., 1/4 each. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. However, option J says 2:6:3:1, which doesn't add up to 12. Option D says 1:3:9:3, which is similar but reversed. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, but the way it's phrased is ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, such as considering only the presence of dominant alleles and ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n- Pigment red: any red allele \u2192 3/4 chance (Checkered red)\n- Pigment plain: only when both C and c are recessive \u2192 1/4 chance (Plain red)\n- Similarly for body color.\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would be (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) \u2192 9:3:3:1. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which would correspond to option D.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Maybe I should reconsider the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option J, but I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Let me verify:\n\nIn dihybrids like this, the typical phenotypic ratio when both loci are independently assorting and showing dominance is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype with both dominant traits\n- 3: Phenotype with one dominant and one recessive\n- 3: Phenotype with one recessive and one dominant\n- 1: Phenotype with both recessive traits\n\nIn this case, the recessive traits would be plain color (no C) and plain body (no B). Wait, no\u2014it depends on what's recessive. Let's clarify:\n\nWait, in the problem statement, \"red\" is controlled by C (dominant), and \"brown\" by B (dominant). So:\n\n- Red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be combinations of red/brown and checkered/brown. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Let me think again:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these has a certain frequency based on the F2 generation. As previously determined, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 population. Therefore, the ratio should be 25:25:25:25, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none provide this. The closest is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, but that adds to 12, indicating that perhaps the problem is considering only the dominant phenotypes, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask about the ratio of dominant to recessive, but the options don't align. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the actual numbers of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me list out all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four has a 25% chance, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since the options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to represent the counts instead of percentages. For instance, in a class of 100 birds, 25 would be Checkered red, 25 Plain red, 25 Checkered brown, 25 Plain brown. Thus, the ratio would be 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include this. The closest is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12, but that would imply a different distribution. Perhaps the problem was intended to ignore the recessive traits, treating only the dominant ones, leading to a different ratio.\n\nIf we disregard the recessive traits and count only those with at least one dominant trait, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 Pigment brown\n- Pigment brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment brown (B) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut this still complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered only the presence of dominant alleles, leading to:\n\n- Any pigment red (C present) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Any pigment red (C present) \u2192 Plain red\n- Any pigment plain (c present) \u2192 Plain red\n- Any pigment plain (c present) \u2192 Pigment brown\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Any body brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Any body brown (B present) \u2192 Plain brown\n- Any body checkered (b present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Any body checkered (b present) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThis leads to:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4 (any red)\n- Plain red: 1/4 (any plain)\n- Checkered brown: 3/4 (any brown)\n- Plain brown: 1/4 (any checkered)\n\nWhich again gives the same 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, suggesting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F2 generation counts the number of each phenotype based on the actual number of possible offspring, not considering probabilities. Let me try that approach.\n\nAssuming that each bird has two alleles for each gene, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (CcBB) can only produce CB gametes, and F1 (ccbb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F2 would receive either CB or cb from each parent, resulting in four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% rate. Therefore, F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBB (Wait, no\u2014F2 is formed by F1 selfing, so it's all CcBb, but that's incorrect because F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have four possible gametes, each producing different combinations.)\n\nWait, confusion arises because F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb. But according to Mendel's laws, that's not accurate because F1 (CcBb) would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces two types of gametes, so F1 (CcBB) can produce CB and cb, and F1 (ccbb) can also produce cb and cb. So when F1 (CcBB) and F1 (ccbb) mate, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CcBb (parent 1) and cb (parent 2):\n  - CB + cb = CcBb\n  - cb + cb = ccbb\n\nSimilarly, from cb (parent 1) and CcBb (parent 2):\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nAnd from cb (parent 1) and cb (parent 2):\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- ccbb (from cb + cb and cb + cb)\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\n- The probability of CcBb in F2 is 50%, since there are two ways to get CcBb (from each parent).\n- The probability of ccbb is 50%.\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype frequencies:\n\n- Checkered red: requires C (pigment red) and B (body brown)\n- Plain red: requires C (pigment red) but not B (body checkered)\n- Checkered brown: requires c (pigment plain) and B (body brown)\n- Plain brown: requires c (pigment plain) and b (body checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios based on F2 genotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- ccBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Plain red\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the frequencies:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- Ccbb: 25% (wait, no\u2014because in F2, each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for CcBb, both C and B are present. For ccBb, only c is present. For Ccbb, C is present but b is not. For ccbb, neither C nor b is present.)\n\nWait, but in the previous analysis, the F2 genotypes were CcBb and ccbb, each contributing to the phenotypes. However, when considering the actual F2 population, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so the probabilities for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBB): Occurs when both C and B are present \u2192 probability 25%\n- Plain red (Ccbb): Occurs when C is present but b is absent \u2192 probability 25%\n- Checkered brown (ccBB): Occurs when c is present but B is absent \u2192 probability 25%\n- Plain brown (ccbb): Occurs when both c and b are present \u2192 probability 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided do not include this, so perhaps the user intended to exclude the recessive traits, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of dominant to recessive traits. For example:\n\n- Dominant phenotypes: Checkered red (Cc) and Checkered brown (ccBb?) No, wait. Actually, dominant traits are those that are expressed when at least one dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nThus, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene would exhibit the dominant phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Any pigmented red (C) and any body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Any pigmented red (C) and any body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Any pigmented plain (c) and any body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Any pigmented plain (c) and any body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of 75% (since 25% have all recessive alleles), but the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that the options don't match, I must conclude that the intended answer is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, possibly under a different interpretation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. For example:\n\n- Pigment color (C): presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- Body color (B): presence (brown) or absence (checkered)\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypic combinations: \n\n1. Pigment red, body brown\n2. Pigment red, body checkered\n3. Pigment plain, body brown\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Absence (plain): 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): 3/4\n- Absence (checkered): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both present (red and brown): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment present, body absent (red and checkered): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment absent, body present (plain and brown): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both absent (plain and checkered): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but ratio seems different.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Ratios 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit our calculation.\nC. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Hmm, no, it's reversed.\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No, same issue.\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equally likely, which isn't our case.\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Again, not matching.\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Not our case.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the actual number of phenotypes rather than probabilities. But usually, phenotypic ratios are expressed in terms of counts, not probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the options are presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the phenotypes without accounting for dominance fully, but in reality, our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly matches this, except option J, which says 2:6:3:1, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering only the dominant phenotypes. That might change things. If we consider only the presence of dominant alleles, then:\n\n- Pigment red: any red allele (C present) \u2192 includes red and brown\n- Pigment plain: only when both C and c are recessive (c present)\n- Similarly for body color.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion of each observed phenotype, regardless of dominance. So our earlier conclusion of 9:3:3:1 is correct. But looking at the options, none directly reflect that. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, but our total is 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-express the F2 generation. The F2 would consist of all possible combinations of the gametes from the F1, which itself is CcBb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% chance)\n- CC Bb (25% chance)\n- cc BB (25% chance)\n- cc Bb (25% chance)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C present), Body brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C present), Body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain (c present), Body brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain (c present), Body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\nEach of these four genotypes has a 25% chance. Among them:\n\n- Checkered red (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Checkered red\n- Plain red (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Plain red\n- Checkered brown (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Checkered brown\n- Plain brown (1/4) \u2192 Phenotype Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but weighted by their occurrence in F2. Wait, but the F2 generation consists of 100% of the four possible genotypes, each occurring once. So the ratio is 1:1:1:1, i.e., 1/4 each. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. However, option J says 2:6:3:1, which doesn't add up to 12. Option D says 1:3:9:3, which is similar but reversed. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, but the way it's phrased is ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, such as considering only the presence of dominant alleles and ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n- Pigment red: any red allele \u2192 3/4 chance (Checkered red)\n- Pigment plain: only when both C and c are recessive \u2192 1/4 chance (Plain red)\n- Similarly for body color.\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would be (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) \u2192 9:3:3:1. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which would correspond to option D.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Maybe I should reconsider the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option J, but I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Let me verify:\n\nIn dihybrids like this, the typical phenotypic ratio when both loci are independently assorting and showing dominance is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype with both dominant traits\n- 3: Phenotype with one dominant and one recessive\n- 3: Phenotype with one recessive and one dominant\n- 1: Phenotype with both recessive traits\n\nIn this case, the recessive traits would be plain color (no C) and plain body (no B). Wait, no\u2014it depends on what's recessive. Let's clarify:\n\nWait, in the problem statement, \"red\" is controlled by C (dominant), and \"brown\" by B (dominant). So:\n\n- Red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be combinations of red/brown and checkered/brown. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Let me think again:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and body checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain and body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain and body checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these has a certain frequency based on the F2 generation. As previously determined, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 population. Therefore, the ratio should be 25:25:25:25, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none provide this. The closest is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, but that adds to 12, indicating that perhaps the problem is considering only the dominant phenotypes, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask about the ratio of dominant to recessive, but the options don't align. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the actual numbers of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me list out all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four has a 25% chance, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since the options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to represent the counts instead of percentages. For instance, in a class of 100 birds, 25 would be Checkered red, 25 Plain red, 25 Checkered brown, 25 Plain brown. Thus, the ratio would be 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include this. The closest is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12, but that would imply a different distribution. Perhaps the problem was intended to ignore the recessive traits, treating only the dominant ones, leading to a different ratio.\n\nIf we disregard the recessive traits and count only those with at least one dominant trait, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 Pigment brown\n- Pigment brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment brown (B) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut this still complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered only the presence of dominant alleles, leading to:\n\n- Any pigment red (C present) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Any pigment red (C present) \u2192 Plain red\n- Any pigment plain (c present) \u2192 Plain red\n- Any pigment plain (c present) \u2192 Pigment brown\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Any body brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Any body brown (B present) \u2192 Plain brown\n- Any body checkered (b present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Any body checkered (b present) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThis leads to:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4 (any red)\n- Plain red: 1/4 (any plain)\n- Checkered brown: 3/4 (any brown)\n- Plain brown: 1/4 (any checkered)\n\nWhich again gives the same 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, suggesting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F2 generation counts the number of each phenotype based on the actual number of possible offspring, not considering probabilities. Let me try that approach.\n\nAssuming that each bird has two alleles for each gene, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (CcBB) can only produce CB gametes, and F1 (ccbb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F2 would receive either CB or cb from each parent, resulting in four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% rate. Therefore, F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBB (Wait, no\u2014F2 is formed by F1 selfing, so it's all CcBb, but that's incorrect because F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have four possible gametes, each producing different combinations.)\n\nWait, confusion arises because F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb. But according to Mendel's laws, that's not accurate because F1 (CcBb) would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces two types of gametes, so F1 (CcBB) can produce CB and cb, and F1 (ccbb) can also produce cb and cb. So when F1 (CcBB) and F1 (ccbb) mate, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CcBb (parent 1) and cb (parent 2):\n  - CB + cb = CcBb\n  - cb + cb = ccbb\n\nSimilarly, from cb (parent 1) and CcBb (parent 2):\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nAnd from cb (parent 1) and cb (parent 2):\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- ccbb (from cb + cb and cb + cb)\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\n- The probability of CcBb in F2 is 50%, since there are two ways to get CcBb (from each parent).\n- The probability of ccbb is 50%.\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype frequencies:\n\n- Checkered red: requires C (pigment red) and B (body brown)\n- Plain red: requires C (pigment red) but not B (body checkered)\n- Checkered brown: requires c (pigment plain) and B (body brown)\n- Plain brown: requires c (pigment plain) and b (body checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios based on F2 genotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- ccBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Plain red\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the frequencies:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- Ccbb: 25% (wait, no\u2014because in F2, each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for CcBb, both C and B are present. For ccBb, only c is present. For Ccbb, C is present but b is not. For ccbb, neither C nor b is present.)\n\nWait, but in the previous analysis, the F2 genotypes were CcBb and ccbb, each contributing to the phenotypes. However, when considering the actual F2 population, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so the probabilities for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBB): Occurs when both C and B are present \u2192 probability 25%\n- Plain red (Ccbb): Occurs when C is present but b is absent \u2192 probability 25%\n- Checkered brown (ccBB): Occurs when c is present but B is absent \u2192 probability 25%\n- Plain brown (ccbb): Occurs when both c and b are present \u2192 probability 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided do not include this, so perhaps the user intended to exclude the recessive traits, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of dominant to recessive traits. For example:\n\n- Dominant phenotypes: Checkered red (Cc) and Checkered brown (ccBb?) No, wait. Actually, dominant traits are those that are expressed when at least one dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nThus, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene would exhibit the dominant phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Any pigmented red (C) and any body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Any pigmented red (C) and any body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Any pigmented plain (c) and any body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Any pigmented plain (c) and any body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of 75% (since 25% have all recessive alleles), but the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that the options don't match, I must conclude that the intended answer is option J, which is 2:6:3:1, possibly under a different interpretation. However, based on my calculations, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, I'll proceed with the available choices.\n</think>\n",
