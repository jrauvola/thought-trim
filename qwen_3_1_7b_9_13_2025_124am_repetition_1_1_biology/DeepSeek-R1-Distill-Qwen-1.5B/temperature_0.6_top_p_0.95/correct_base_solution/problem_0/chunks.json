Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n- Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles.\n\nNext, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotype of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\n2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent.\n   - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant.\n   - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive.\n\n3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes.\n\nWait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct.\n\nNow, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?\n\nWait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb).\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nEach gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene:\n\n- C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)\n\nSo for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.\n\nWait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b).\n\nThe possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nAlternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.\n\nGiven that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where:\n\n- If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B).\n- If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C).\n\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute them:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nAh, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B.\n\nParent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b\n\nEach combination occurs with specific probabilities.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.\n\nWe'll use a Punnett square to model this.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes:\n\n- CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 will have combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nBut wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities for each class.\n\nClass A: Both C and B are present.\n- Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nHowever, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.\n\nWait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part\n\nBut since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.\n\nLooking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\n\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nL.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G.\n\nM.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H.\n\nN.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I.\n\nO.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as J.\n\nP.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as K.\n\nQ.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as L.\n\nR.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as M.\n\nS.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as N.\n\nT.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as O.\n\nU.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as K.\n\nV.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as L.\n\nW.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as M.\n\nX.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as N.\n\nY.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as O.\n\nZ.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as K.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them seem to exactly match the 9,3,3,1 ratio. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which does add up to 16, matching our calculation.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So according to our calculations:\n\n- Checkered red (plain brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: 3\n- Checkered brown (red) \u2192 Phenotype B: 3\n- Plain red (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype A:9\n- Plain brown (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D:1\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut wait, checking the answer options, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?\n\nWait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities for each class.\n\nClass A: Both C and B are present.\n- Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nHowever, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.\n\nWait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part\n\nBut since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.\n\nLooking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\n\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nL.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G.\n\nM.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H.\n\nN.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I.\n\nO.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as J.\n\nP.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as K.\n\nQ.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as L.\n\nR.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as M.\n\nS.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as N.\n\nT.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as O.\n\nU.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as K.\n\nV.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as L.\n\nW.5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as M.\n\nX.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as N.\n\nY.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as O.\n\nZ.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as K.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them seem to exactly match the 9,3,3,1 ratio. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which does add up to 16, matching our calculation.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So according to our calculations:\n\n- Checkered red (plain brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: 3\n- Checkered brown (red) \u2192 Phenotype B: 3\n- Plain red (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype A:9\n- Plain brown (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D:1\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut wait, checking the answer options, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation.",

    "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem.",
    "Let me start by reading it carefully.",
    "The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.",
    "There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb).",
    "We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.",
    "First, let's break down the information:",
    "- Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)",
    "So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.",
    "The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles.",
    "The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles.",
    "Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).",
    "Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation.",
    "Let me outline the steps:",
    "1. Determine the genotype of the parents.",
    "- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)",
    "2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent.",
    "- Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant.",
    "- Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive.",
    "3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes.",
    "Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.",
    "But maybe the initial setup is correct.",
    "Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb.",
    "Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.",
    "Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are:",
    "- CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive)",
    "But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned.",
    "When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb.",
    "Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb?",
    "Or is it just CB and cb?",
    "Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles.",
    "Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes.",
    "Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.",
    "So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb.",
    "Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb?",
    "No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.",
    "So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous.",
    "So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb.",
    "But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb).",
    "Wait, no, that's incorrect.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The F1 is CcBb.",
    "It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.",
    "So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:",
    "- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)",
    "Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "So yes, each combination occurs at 25%.",
    "Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.",
    "For the C locus (pigment):",
    "- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain",
    "For the B locus (color):",
    "- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered",
    "Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.",
    "Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene:",
    "- C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered)",
    "So for each gene, there are two possibilities.",
    "Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.",
    "Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows.",
    "Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.",
    "So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b).",
    "The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits.",
    "So for each bird, the phenotype can be:",
    "1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.",
    "Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)",
    "Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.",
    "Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.",
    "Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.",
    "Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.",
    "So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).",
    "So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty.",
    "That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.",
    "Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes.",
    "If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate.",
    "Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color.",
    "The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.",
    "So the phenotype is a combination where:",
    "- If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B).",
    "- If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C).",
    "Thus, the phenotype can be:",
    "1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2.",
    "C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3.",
    "C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.",
    "Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered",
    "Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.",
    "Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.",
    "Let's compute them:",
    "1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.",
    "So I must have made a mistake here.",
    "Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake.",
    "Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.",
    "So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene.",
    "So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.",
    "Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes.",
    "For example, a bird could be:",
    "- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4",
    "To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes.",
    "The parents are:",
    "- Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB.",
    "Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC.",
    "Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.",
    "So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B.",
    "Parent 2: cc bb.",
    "So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.",
    "When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene.",
    "Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.",
    "In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are:",
    "- C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b",
    "Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.",
    "The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.",
    "So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.",
    "We'll use a Punnett square to model this.",
    "The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes:",
    "- CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%)",
    "Thus, the F2 will have combinations:",
    "1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2.",

    "- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)",
    "But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes.",
    "Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.",
    "Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have:",
    "For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)",
    "Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)",
    "But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other.",
    "So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.",
