Independent mutations would mean each mutation has a certain probability of occurring, and if they're independent, the chance that both happen at the same time is the product of their probabilities. If they're linked, then once one mutation occurs, the other can't happen near it as much, reducing the success rate.\n\nLooking at the results: On strain B's lawn, there were 4 pluses, which seems quite low. On strain K's lawn, it was 40 pluses. That suggests that the mutations in the T_4 phage are more likely to cause problems when they occur together rather than separately.

Recombination frequency usually ranges from 0% to 100%, where 0% means no recombination (the mutations are independent), and 100% means complete recombination (they are linked).

    "rollout": " coli strain divides into two equal parts. One part is then dilated to 1:10^7, meaning each plasmid has about 1e-7 DNA molecules, which would lead to a very low chance of plating. This half is then plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is dilated to 1:10^5, which is higher than the first, giving more plating chances. This second sample is then placed on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe experiment results showed 4 pluces on K and 40 on B. So, the outcome depends on whether the mutation was lost or retained in the daughter phage. If the mutation is lost, the phage will replicate and lyse the cell, causing division. If it's retained, it'll stick around and cause division again. \n\nIn the first sample (diluted 1:1e7), 40 pluces were found. That's a high number, suggesting that the phage replicated and lysed, losing the mutation. In the second sample (diluted 1:1e5), only 4 pluces were seen. Again, this suggests that the mutation wasn't retained; the phage stuck around and lysed again. \n\nWait, but if the mutation was lost, the plance count would be lower because the phage would replicate and lyse. Conversely, if the mutation was retained, the phage wouldn't replicate as much, leading to fewer plances. So in the first case, with 40 pluces (high), the mutation must have been lost. In the second, 4 pluces (low), the mutation remains.\n\nSo, the loss of the mutation explains the higher count in the first sample, and retention in the second. Therefore, the two mutations are linked such that their combination leads to loss in the first and retention in the second. \n\nNow, how do we calculate the recombination frequency? Recombination refers to the probability that the two mutations occur in the same gene (on the same chromosome) versus different chromosomes. Since the mutations are on the same T_4 phage chromosome (as it's within the genome region), the chance of recombination would determine whether the mutations stay together or separate.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the mutations remain on the same chromosome, so the lysogenic phage would still lose the mutation upon replication, leading to high plance counts like in the first sample. If there's recombination, the mutation might be separated, making the lysogenic phage retain its mutation, leading to low plance counts in the second sample where the mutation isn't lost.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the lysogenic phage is dying (replicates), so it loses the mutation. The nonlysogenic phage retains it. So the scenario matches the situation where recombination didn't occur, allowing the lysogenic phage to lose the mutation. Alternatively, if recombination did occur, the lysogenic phage would retain the mutation, leading to more plances, but in our data, it's less.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think differently. The presence of the mutation in the lysogenic phage indicates that the recombination occurred, as the mutation stayed despite replication. Wait, no\u2014because in our case, the lysogenic phage lost the mutation, which should indicate that recombination occurred, but perhaps I'm mixing up concepts here.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination rate is determined by how often the two mutations are inherited together. Since the lysogenic phage loses the mutation, it means that recombination happened. But in reality, when two genes are on the same chromosome, they tend to be inherited together unless there's an inversion or transposition, which complicates things. However, for simplicity, let's assume that the recombination rate is the fraction of times the mutation was lost, indicating that recombination occurs.\n\nGiven that in the first sample, the lysogenic phage lost the mutation, while in the second, it retained it, the recombination event must have occurred in some cases. The total number of plances tells us the proportion of cells where the mutation was lost versus retained. \n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant individuals / total number of individuals)\n\nHere, the number of recombinant individuals would be those where the mutation was lost, i.e., 40 pluces out of the total. But wait, the problem states that the other half is plated on strain K. So the total number of plates is split into two groups: 40 on B and 4 on K. So the total number is 40 + 4 = 44. Out of these, 40 had the mutation lost, implying recombination occurred in 40/44 cases. But wait, that seems off because in the first group, 40 pluces mean the mutation was lost, and in the second, 4 pluces mean it was retained. So the number of recombinants is 40, and the total is 44.\n\nSo rf = 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909 or 91%. But none of the options match 91%, so perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the experiment involves two independent events\u2014the loss of the mutation in the first group and the retention in the second\u2014each contributes to the recombination frequency. Maybe the correct way is to consider that the occurrence of the mutation being lost (40 places) implies that the mutation was lost in some fraction of the population. Similarly, the mutation being retained (4 pluses) implies it was retained in another fraction.\n\nSince the recombination frequency is the probability that the two mutations are inherited from both parents, we can model this as the product of the probabilities of each event occurring independently. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- r = recombination frequency.\n- P_loss = probability that the lysogenic phage loses the mutation.\n- P_retain = probability that it retains it.\n\nFrom the data:\n- In the first sample (dilution 1:1e7), 40 pluces out of N cells (say N=44 total cells, since 40+4=44). So P_loss = 40/44 \u2248 0.909.\n- In the second sample (dilution 1:1e5), 4 pluces out of 4 cells, so P_retain = 4/4 = 1.0.\n\nAssuming independence, P_loss * P_retain \u2248 0.909 * 1.0 = 0.909, which is close to the observed rf. But this doesn\u2019t directly give the rf itself.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the fact that the expected number of recombinants is the product of the probabilities of each event. So:\n\nExpected recombinants = P_loss * P_retain = 0.909 * 1.0 = 0.909. But since the actual number is 40, and the total is 44, perhaps the rf is calculated differently.\n\nAnother approach: The recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nrf = (number of recombinants) / (total number - number of recombinants).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the rf is given by:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant cells) / (total cells without recombination).\n\nThis is getting confusing. Perhaps a better way is to look at the ratio of plances.\n\nIn the first sample, 40 pluces (loss) vs 4 pluces (retain). The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the loss of the mutation is ten times more likely than the retention. \n\nIf the recombination happened once every time, the loss would be 100% and retention 0%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain divides into two equal parts. One part is then dilated to 1:10^7, meaning each plasmid has about 1e-7 DNA molecules, which would lead to a very low chance of plating. This half is then plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is dilated to 1:10^5, which is higher than the first, giving more plating chances. This second sample is then placed on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe experiment results showed 4 pluces on K and 40 on B. So, the outcome depends on whether the mutation was lost or retained in the daughter phage. If the mutation is lost, the phage will replicate and lyse the cell, causing division. If it's retained, it'll stick around and cause division again. \n\nIn the first sample (diluted 1:1e7), 40 pluces were found. That's a high number, suggesting that the phage replicated and lysed, losing the mutation. In the second sample (diluted 1:1e5), only 4 pluces were seen. Again, this suggests that the mutation wasn't retained; the phage stuck around and lysed again. \n\nWait, but if the mutation was lost, the plance count would be lower because the phage would replicate and lyse. Conversely, if the mutation was retained, the phage wouldn't replicate as much, leading to fewer plances. So in the first case, with 40 pluces (high), the mutation must have been lost. In the second, 4 pluces (low), the mutation remains.\n\nSo, the loss of the mutation explains the higher count in the first sample, and retention in the second. Therefore, the two mutations are linked such that their combination leads to loss in the first and retention in the second. \n\nNow, how do we calculate the recombination frequency? Recombination refers to the probability that the two mutations occur in the same gene (on the same chromosome) versus different chromosomes. Since the mutations are on the same T_4 phage chromosome (as it's within the genome region), the chance of recombination would determine whether the mutations stay together or separate.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the mutations remain on the same chromosome, so the lysogenic phage would still lose the mutation upon replication, leading to high plance counts like in the first sample. If there's recombination, the mutation might be separated, making the lysogenic phage retain its mutation, leading to low plance counts in the second sample where the mutation isn't lost.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the lysogenic phage is dying (replicates), so it loses the mutation. The nonlysogenic phage retains it. So the scenario matches the situation where recombination didn't occur, allowing the lysogenic phage to lose the mutation. Alternatively, if recombination did occur, the lysogenic phage would retain the mutation, leading to more plances, but in our data, it's less.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think differently. The presence of the mutation in the lysogenic phage indicates that the recombination occurred, as the mutation stayed despite replication. Wait, no\u2014because in our case, the lysogenic phage lost the mutation, which should indicate that recombination occurred, but perhaps I'm mixing up concepts here.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination rate is determined by how often the two mutations are inherited together. Since the lysogenic phage loses the mutation, it means that recombination happened. But in reality, when two genes are on the same chromosome, they tend to be inherited together unless there's an inversion or transposition, which complicates things. However, for simplicity, let's assume that the recombination rate is the fraction of times the mutation was lost, indicating that recombination occurs.\n\nGiven that in the first sample, the lysogenic phage lost the mutation, while in the second, it retained it, the recombination event must have occurred in some cases. The total number of plances tells us the proportion of cells where the mutation was lost versus retained. \n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant individuals / total number of individuals)\n\nHere, the number of recombinant individuals would be those where the mutation was lost, i.e., 40 pluces out of the total. But wait, the problem states that the other half is plated on strain K. So the total number of plates is split into two groups: 40 on B and 4 on K. So the total number is 40 + 4 = 44. Out of these, 40 had the mutation lost, implying recombination occurred in 40/44 cases. But wait, that seems off because in the first group, 40 pluces mean the mutation was lost, and in the second, 4 pluces mean it was retained. So the number of recombinants is 40, and the total is 44.\n\nSo rf = 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909 or 91%. But none of the options match 91%, so perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the experiment involves two independent events\u2014the loss of the mutation in the first group and the retention in the second\u2014each contributes to the recombination frequency. Maybe the correct way is to consider that the occurrence of the mutation being lost (40 places) implies that the mutation was lost in some fraction of the population. Similarly, the mutation being retained (4 pluses) implies it was retained in another fraction.\n\nSince the recombination frequency is the probability that the two mutations are inherited from both parents, we can model this as the product of the probabilities of each event occurring independently. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- r = recombination frequency.\n- P_loss = probability that the lysogenic phage loses the mutation.\n- P_retain = probability that it retains it.\n\nFrom the data:\n- In the first sample (dilution 1:1e7), 40 pluces out of N cells (say N=44 total cells, since 40+4=44). So P_loss = 40/44 \u2248 0.909.\n- In the second sample (dilution 1:1e5), 4 pluces out of 4 cells, so P_retain = 4/4 = 1.0.\n\nAssuming independence, P_loss * P_retain \u2248 0.909 * 1.0 = 0.909, which is close to the observed rf. But this doesn\u2019t directly give the rf itself.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the fact that the expected number of recombinants is the product of the probabilities of each event. So:\n\nExpected recombinants = P_loss * P_retain = 0.909 * 1.0 = 0.909. But since the actual number is 40, and the total is 44, perhaps the rf is calculated differently.\n\nAnother approach: The recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nrf = (number of recombinants) / (total number - number of recombinants).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the rf is given by:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant cells) / (total cells without recombination).\n\nThis is getting confusing. Perhaps a better way is to look at the ratio of plances.\n\nIn the first sample, 40 pluces (loss) vs 4 pluces (retain). The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the loss of the mutation is ten times more likely than the retention. \n\nIf the recombination happened once every time, the loss would be 100% and retention 0%. But in reality, it's 10 times more likely to lose than retain, so the recombination frequency is such that:\n\nP_loss = x,\nP_retain = y,\nand x/y = 10 \u21d2 x = 10y.\n\nSince x + y \u2264 1 (assuming no interference), 10y + y \u2264 1 \u21d2 11y \u22641 \u21d2 y \u22641/11\u22480.0909\u21d2 P_retain \u22649.09%.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency would be approximately 9.09%, which is roughly 0.09 or 9%. Looking at the options, the closest is F. 0.3 percent. Hmm, that's too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratios.

So if the two mutations were linked, they'd probably show up more efficiently, maybe fewer plumes or some pattern indicating their interaction.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutants likely reduces the number of plumes, as both could cause issues.

Instead, it's about the efficiency of the mutations. The number of plumes depends on how many times the mutations occurred in the phages.

The number of plumes should relate to the product of the frequencies of each mutation occurring in the phages. Suppose the frequency of each mutation is p and q respectively. Then the expected number of plumes would be proportional to pq * (1 - pq), where (1 - pq) accounts for the non-coupled events.

Wait, but the problem states that when both mutants are present, the division is halved. So perhaps the initial number of divisions is important.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The initial plate has E. coli strain B infected by two mutantphages. After splitting, each half is plated onto a different strain. For strain B, four plumes appear, and for strain K, four as well. This suggests that the act of splitting and subsequent plating on different strains resulted in similar numbers of plumes. \n\nIf the two mutations were linked, the phages carrying both mutations would replicate fewer times, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, if they were independent, each mutation would affect the same set of phages, leading to more plumes.\n\nBut the exact number of plumes is tied to the frequency of each mutation and their independence. The formula I remember is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant colonies) / (Total number of colonies)\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs in a certain fraction of phages, say p and q, the expected number of recombinant colonies would be 2pq(1 - pq)/n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the observed number of plumes can help calculate the recombination frequency.\n\nLooking at the data: when both mutants are present, the division is half. That implies that the two mutants didn't interact in causing the splitting. If they did interact, they might cause more efficient splitting. Since the division is normal, the mutations aren't interacting, so their recombination is low.\n\nWait, but the exact calculation requires knowing the number of plumes from each scenario. Let me consider that each mutation alone would lead to a certain number of plumes, and when combined, the effect is additive. But I'm not entirely clear on how to compute the recombination frequency directly from the number of plumes.\n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of interference in recombination. If the mutations are tightly linked, there's little or no interference, and the number of recombinant colonies increases. Without interference, the number of recombinants is roughly 2pq, assuming p and q are small fractions.

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there are four plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that recombination refers to how these mutations interact. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be calculated using some formula, often involving probabilities of each mutation type. But here, since the experiment shows specific numbers, I think I should use the observed data to calculate the actual recombination rate.\n\nThe key here is that in a dilution series, if the mutations were independent, the number of recombinant plasmids would follow a Poisson distribution. However, in reality, the observed counts might indicate dependence or independence. Since the problem states that the lytic phage doesn't cause a problem, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause issues. So maybe the recombination rate is higher than expected under independence.\n\nLet me denote the frequency of the lysogenic mutation as p and the recombination frequency as r. If the mutations were independent, the probability of recombination would be p*(1 - q), where q is the frequency of the non-lysogenic mutation. But wait, actually, if the mutations are linked independently, the probability of recombination is p*q*r. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nSince the experiment involves different dilutions, the expected number of plumes would depend on the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. For example, if both mutations occurred independently, the probability of a recombinant plasmid would be p*q, and the expected count would be proportional to that.\n\nBut in reality, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing problems alone, it implies that the recombination rate is higher than expected. Wait, perhaps I should model this using the observed counts. On strain B, we have fewer plumes (4) compared to strain K (40). That suggests that the mutation responsible for the issue is less common in strain B, which makes sense because strain B might have the lysogenic mutation being more problematic. But why is strain K showing more? Maybe because the recombination leads to a more common mutation, making it easier for the lysogenic phage to replicate despite being less frequent.\n\nSo, let's say the recombination frequency is r. Then, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (p * (1 - r)) + ((1 - p) * r) = p*(1 - r) + (1 - p)*r. But I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, if the mutations are independent, the number of recombinant plasmids would be approximately (p * (1 - q)), assuming q is small. But without knowing p and q individually, maybe I can relate the observed counts to the possible values.\n\nGiven that on B, 4 plumes were seen, and on K, 40, and considering the different dilutions, perhaps the recombination frequency is low, leading to fewer plumes on B. Since the lysogenic phage alone doesn't cause issues, maybe the recombination leads to a more common mutation, thus requiring more cells to replicate, hence more plumes.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of cells in each dilution is important. On strain B, the first half was plated at 1:10^7, meaning each culture has 1e7 cells. On strain K, it's 1:10^5, so 1e5 cells. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful plasmid replication events. The expected number under independence would be the product of the dilution factors times the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I think the correct formula is that the expected number of recombinant plasmids is (p * (1 - r)) * D1 + ((1 - p) * r) * D2, where D1 and D2 are the dilution factors. In our case, D1 = 1e7 and D2 = 1e5. So,\n\nExpected B = p*(1 - r)*1e7\nExpected K = (1 - p)*r*1e5\n\nWe know that Expected B = 4 and Expected K = 40.\n\nSo:\n\n4 = p*(1 - r)*1e7 \u2192 p*(1 - r) = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7\n40 = (1 - p)*r*1e5 \u2192 (1 - p)*r = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4\n\nNow, from the second equation:\n(1 - p)*r = 0.4 \u2192 r = 0.4 / (1 - p)\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\np*(1 - (0.4/(1 - p))) )= 4e-7\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can approximate. Since 4e-7 is very small, p must be very small. Also, 0.4 is relatively large compared to p.\n\nAssuming p is negligible compared to 1, then 1 - p \u2248 1. So,\n\nFrom the second equation:\nr \u2248 0.4\n\nBut wait, 0.4 is 40%, which seems high given the context. Maybe my assumption that p is negligible is incorrect. Let me try solving without approximation.\n\nLet me set up the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: p*(1 - r) = 4e-7\nEquation 2: (1 - p)*r = 0.4\n\nLet me solve Equation 2 for (1 - p):\n\n(1 - p) = 0.4 / r\n\nThen plug into Equation 1:\n\np*(1 - (0.4/r)) = 4e-7\n\nExpress p in terms of r:\n\np = 4e-7 / (1 - 0.4/r)\n\nBut this is getting messy. Maybe instead, make an assumption that p is much smaller than 1. Then, 1 - r \u2248 1, so Equation 1 becomes p \u2248 4e-7. Then, from Equation 2:\n\n(1 - p)*r \u2248 0.4 \u2192 (1 - 4e-7)*r \u2248 0.4 \u2192 r \u2248 0.4\n\nWhich gives r \u2248 0.4, or 40%. But that seems too high because the experiment shows significantly more plumes on K than on B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nOn strain B, the first half is plated at D1=1e7, expecting (p*(1 - r))*D1 plumes.\nSimilarly, on strain K, the first half is plated at D2=1e5, expecting ((1 - p)*r)*D2 plumes.\n\nSo, plume counts are:\n\nB: p*(1 - r)*1e7 = 4 \u2192 p*(1 - r) = 4/1e7 = 4e-7\nK: (1 - p)*r*1e5 = 40 \u2192 (1 - p)*r = 40/1e5 = 0.4\n\nSo, from K:\n\n(1 - p)*r = 0.4 \u2192 r = 0.4 / (1 - p)\n\nFrom B:\n\np*(1 - r) = 4e-7 \u2192 p*(1 - 0.4/(1 - p)) )= 4e-7\n\nAgain, this looks complex. Perhaps assume p is negligible. Then:\n\n1 - r \u2248 1 \u2192 p \u2248 4e-7\n\nAnd from K:\n\nr \u2248 0.4\n\nThus, recombination frequency is about 40%.\n\nBut the options don't include 40%, the highest is F (0.3%). So clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the expected number of plumes is the sum of the products of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. So, the expected number of recombinant plasmids is (p * (1 - q)) * D1 + ((1 - p) * q) * D2. But without knowing q, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the presence of the lysogenic phage requires a certain number of plasmids. The fact that only strain B shows any issues suggests that the recombination is such that the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive in strain B, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nWait, another idea: Since only strain B shows any issues, and the other half is used on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is low enough that the lysogenic phage is more likely to die in strain B, reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, in strain K, the lysogenic phage might have a higher chance, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf I let r be the recombination frequency, then in strain B, the expected number of plumes from the lysogenic phage would be proportional to (1 - r). Similarly, in strain K, it would be proportional to r.\n\nGiven that on strain B, 4 plumes were found, and on K, 40, which is 10 times more. This suggests that the expected number in K is 10 times higher than in B, which could imply that the recombination frequency in K is 10 times higher than in B.\n\nBut how does that translate? Let's see:\n\nSuppose in strain B, the expected number is E_B = k * (1 - r)\nIn strain K, E_K = m * r\n\nGiven that E_B = 4 and E_K = 40, so E_K = 10 * E_B.\n\nIf we assume that the constants k and m are similar, then r = 10 * (1 - r) \u2192 r = 10 - 10r \u2192 11r = 10 \u2192 r \u2248 0.909, which is 90.9%, but that's impossible because r can't exceed 100%.\n\nTherefore, my assumption is wrong. Maybe the recombination frequency affects the counts differently in each strain. Perhaps the dilution factors affect the expectation inversely.\n\nAnother thought: The ratio of plume counts is 40/4 = 10. So, E_K/E_B = 10.\n\nBut E_K = m * r and E_B = k * (1 - r)\n\nAssuming k and m are related, perhaps E_K = 10 * E_B, so m * r = 10 * k * (1 - r)\n\nBut without knowing k and m, this doesn't help directly. Maybe I need to express everything in terms of r.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of plumes on B is (1 - r) * D_B, where D_B is the number of cells plated. Similarly for K.\n\nSo:\n\nOn B: E_B = (1 - r) * 1e7 * p\nOn K: E_K = r * 1e5 * (1 - p)\n\nBut I don't know p, so this might not help. Maybe I need to assume p is small, like p \u2248 0.0001, making (1 - p) \u2248 1.\n\nThen,\n\nE_B \u2248 (1 - r) * 1e7 * 0.0001 = (1 - r) * 1e3\nE_K \u2248 r * 1e5 * 1 = r * 1e5\n\nGiven E_B = 4 and E_K = 40,\n\n4 \u2248 (1 - r) * 1e3 \u2192 (1 - r) \u2248 0.004 \u2192 r \u2248 0.996, which is 99.6%, still too high.\n\nHmm, that's not working either. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps the actual number of recombination events determines the plume counts. Each recombination event creates a new plasmid, increasing the likelihood of replication.\n\nBut without knowing the exact relationship between the recombination frequency and the plume count, it's challenging. Maybe I should look for a simpler relation.\n\nWait, another angle: the difference in plume counts between B and K is significant. On B, only 4 plumes, while on K, there are 40. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B reduces its replication capacity, whereas in strain K, it enhances it. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be high enough in K to compensate for the lower replication in B.\n\nPerhaps the recombination frequency in K is such that the lysogenic phage can replicate even better in that strain, leading to more plumes. So, if r is high in K, then the expected plumes increase.\n\nGiven that E_K = 40, and E_B = 4, which is 10 times more. So, if r increases by a factor of 10, then E_K becomes 10*40=400, which is too high. So that approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency in K is 10 times that in B. Suppose r_B = x, then r_K = 10x. Then, E_K = 10x * 1e5 = 1e6 x, and E_B = (1 - x) *1e7. Given that E_K = 10*E_B,\n\n1e6 x = 10*(1 - x)*1e7 \u2192 1e6 x = 1e8*(1 - x) \u2192 x = 1e8*(1 - x)/1e6 \u2192 x = 100*(1 - x)\n\n\u2192 x = 100 - 100x \u2192 101x = 100 \u2192 x \u2248 0.99, which is 99%, again too high.\n\nThis seems stuck. Maybe I need to accept that the recombination frequency is around 0.05% (option G) because that would mean that the lysogenic phage is highly rare, leading to minimal replication in both strains, except in K where it's more common, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, option G is 0.05%, which is very low. Let me check if that fits.\n\nIf r = 0.05%, then r = 0.0005.\n\nFor E_B:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * 1e7 * p \u2248 (0.9995) *1e7 * p. But without knowing p, this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if p is also low, but I don't have enough info. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: Since the test says 4 on B and 40 on K, the ratio is 10:1. So, the expected number in K is 10 times that in B.\n\nAssuming that the expectation scales linearly with recombination frequency, then E_K = 10 * E_B.\n\nBut E_B = (1 - r) * D_B, where D_B is the number of cells plated on B.\n\nAssuming D_B is same for both (since both are 1e7?), then E_B = (1 - r), E_K = 10*(1 - r).\n\nBut E_K = r * D_K, where D_K is the number of cells on K, which is 1e5.\n\nSo,\n\n10*(1 - r) = r * 1e5\n\nSolving for r:\n\n10 - 10r = 1e5 r\n\n10 = 1e5 r + 10r = r*(1e5 +10) \u2248 r*1e5\n\nThus, r \u2248 10 / 1e5 = 0.0001, which is 0.01%.\n\nLooking back at the options, J is 0.05%, H is 0.5%, etc., but 0.01% isn't listed. The closest lower option is E (0.02%) and F (0.3%).\n\nWait, 0.01% is closer to E (0.02%) than to F (0.3%). So, the answer might be E (0.02%), which is close to 0.01%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in scaling. Maybe the expectations scale differently.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * D_B\n\nE_K = r * D_K\n\nGiven that E_K = 10 * E_B\n\nSo,\n\nr * D_K = 10 * (1 - r) * D_B\n\nAssuming D_B = D_K, because both are 1e7 and 1e5 respectively, but that might not hold. Wait, D_B is 1e7, D_K is 1e5, so they're different.\n\nLet me denote D_B = 1e7, D_K = 1e5.\n\nThus,\n\nr * 1e5 = 10*(1 - r) * 1e7\n\nDivide both sides by 1e5:\n\nr = 10*(1 - r)*1e2 \u2192 r = 10*(1 - r)*100\n\nWait, no, 1e7 / 1e5 = 1e2, yes.\n\nSo,\n\nr = 100*(1 - r)\n\n\u2192 r = 100 - 100r\n\n\u2192 101r = 100 \u2192 r \u2248 0.9909%, which is ~0.99%, close to option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But 0.99% isn't among the choices. The closest is E (0.02%) and F (0.3%).\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption that E_K = 10 * E_B is incorrect. Maybe the ratio is different.\n\nWait, another possibility: The number of plumes on K is 10 times that on B, but the dilution factors might affect this differently. On B, you have 1e7 cells, on K, 1e5. So, the number of cells on K is 10 times fewer. Therefore, the expectation per cell would be higher on B.\n\nBut since E_K = 10 * E_B, and D_K = 1e5 vs D_B =1e7, this suggests that the recombination frequency is higher in K, but scaled down due to fewer cells.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute r using the equations:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * D_B * p\n\nE_K = r * D_K * (1 - p)\n\nBut without knowing p, this is tricky. However, if p is small, (1",

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli split into two equal halves, each with half the original number of bacteria.\n\nOne half is then diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there are four plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that recombination refers to how these mutations interact. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be calculated using some formula, often involving probabilities of each mutation type. But here, since the experiment shows specific numbers, I think I should use the observed data to calculate the actual recombination rate.\n\nThe key here is that in a dilution series, if the mutations were independent, the number of recombinant plasmids would follow a Poisson distribution. However, in reality, the observed counts might indicate dependence or independence. Since the problem states that the lytic phage doesn't cause a problem, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause issues. So maybe the recombination rate is higher than expected under independence.\n\nLet me denote the frequency of the lysogenic mutation as p and the recombination frequency as r. If the mutations were independent, the probability of recombination would be p*(1 - q), where q is the frequency of the non-lysogenic mutation. But wait, actually, if the mutations are linked independently, the probability of recombination is p*q*r. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nSince the experiment involves different dilutions, the expected number of plumes would depend on the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. For example, if both mutations occurred independently, the probability of a recombinant plasmid would be p*q, and the expected count would be proportional to that.\n\nBut in reality, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing problems alone, it implies that the recombination rate is higher than expected. Wait, perhaps I should model this using the observed counts. On strain B, we have fewer plumes (4) compared to strain K (40). That suggests that the mutation responsible for the issue is less common in strain B, which makes sense because strain B might have the lysogenic mutation being more problematic. But why is strain K showing more? Maybe because the recombination leads to a more common mutation, making it easier for the lysogenic phage to replicate despite being less frequent.\n\nSo, let's say the recombination frequency is r. Then, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (p * (1 - r)) + ((1 - p) * r) = p*(1 - r) + (1 - p)*r. But I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, if the mutations are independent, the number of recombinant plasmids would be approximately (p * (1 - q)), assuming q is small. But without knowing p and q individually, maybe I can relate the observed counts to the possible values.\n\nGiven that on B, 4 plumes were seen, and on K, 40, and considering the different dilutions, perhaps the recombination frequency is low, leading to fewer plumes on B. Since the lysogenic phage alone doesn't cause issues, maybe the recombination leads to a more common mutation, thus requiring more cells to replicate, hence more plumes.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of cells in each dilution is important. On strain B, the first half was plated at 1:10^7, meaning each culture has 1e7 cells. On strain K, it's 1:10^5, so 1e5 cells. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful plasmid replication events. The expected number under independence would be the product of the dilution factors times the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I think the correct formula is that the expected number of recombinant plasmids is (p * (1 - r)) * D1 + ((1 - p) * r) * D2, where D1 and D2 are the dilution factors. In our case, D1 = 1e7 and D2 = 1e5. So,\n\nExpected B = p*(1 - r)*1e7\nExpected K = (1 - p)*r*1e5\n\nWe know that Expected B = 4 and Expected K = 40.\n\nSo:\n\n4 = p*(1 - r)*1e7 \u2192 p*(1 - r) = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7\n40 = (1 - p)*r*1e5 \u2192 (1 - p)*r = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4\n\nNow, from the second equation:\n(1 - p)*r = 0.4 \u2192 r = 0.4 / (1 - p)\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\np*(1 - (0.4/(1 - p))) )= 4e-7\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can approximate. Since 4e-7 is very small, p must be very small. Also, 0.4 is relatively large compared to p.\n\nAssuming p is negligible compared to 1, then 1 - p \u2248 1. So,\n\nFrom the second equation:\nr \u2248 0.4\n\nBut wait, 0.4 is 40%, which seems high given the context. Maybe my assumption that p is negligible is incorrect. Let me try solving without approximation.\n\nLet me set up the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: p*(1 - r) = 4e-7\nEquation 2: (1 - p)*r = 0.4\n\nLet me solve Equation 2 for (1 - p):\n\n(1 - p) = 0.4 / r\n\nThen plug into Equation 1:\n\np*(1 - (0.4/r)) = 4e-7\n\nExpress p in terms of r:\n\np = 4e-7 / (1 - 0.4/r)\n\nBut this is getting messy. Maybe instead, make an assumption that p is much smaller than 1. Then, 1 - r \u2248 1, so Equation 1 becomes p \u2248 4e-7. Then, from Equation 2:\n\n(1 - p)*r \u2248 0.4 \u2192 (1 - 4e-7)*r \u2248 0.4 \u2192 r \u2248 0.4\n\nWhich gives r \u2248 0.4, or 40%. But that seems too high because the experiment shows significantly more plumes on K than on B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nOn strain B, the first half is plated at D1=1e7, expecting (p*(1 - r))*D1 plumes.\nSimilarly, on strain K, the first half is plated at D2=1e5, expecting ((1 - p)*r)*D2 plumes.\n\nSo, plume counts are:\n\nB: p*(1 - r)*1e7 = 4 \u2192 p*(1 - r) = 4/1e7 = 4e-7\nK: (1 - p)*r*1e5 = 40 \u2192 (1 - p)*r = 40/1e5 = 0.4\n\nSo, from K:\n\n(1 - p)*r = 0.4 \u2192 r = 0.4 / (1 - p)\n\nFrom B:\n\np*(1 - r) = 4e-7 \u2192 p*(1 - 0.4/(1 - p)) )= 4e-7\n\nAgain, this looks complex.

Then:\n\n1 - r \u2248 1 \u2192 p \u2248 4e-7\n\nAnd from K:\n\nr \u2248 0.4\n\nThus, recombination frequency is about 40%.\n\nBut the options don't include 40%, the highest is F (0.3%).

Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: Since the test says 4 on B and 40 on K, the ratio is 10:1. So, the expected number in K is 10 times that in B.\n\nAssuming that the expectation scales linearly with recombination frequency, then E_K = 10 * E_B.\n\nBut E_B = (1 - r) * D_B, where D_B is the number of cells plated on B.\n\nAssuming D_B is same for both (since both are 1e7?), then E_B = (1 - r), E_K = 10*(1 - r).\n\nBut E_K = r * D_K, where D_K is the number of cells on K, which is 1e5.\n\nSo,\n\n10*(1 - r) = r * 1e5\n\nSolving for r:\n\n10 - 10r = 1e5 r\n\n10 = 1e5 r + 10r = r*(1e5 +10) \u2248 r*1e5\n\nThus, r \u2248 10 / 1e5 = 0.0001, which is 0.01%.\n\nLooking back at the options, J is 0.05%, H is 0.5%, etc., but 0.01% isn't listed. The closest lower option is E (0.02%) and F (0.3%).\n\nWait, 0.01% is closer to E (0.02%) than to F (0.3%). So, the answer might be E (0.02%), which is close to 0.01%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in scaling. Maybe the expectations scale differently.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * D_B\n\nE_K = r * D_K\n\nGiven that E_K = 10 * E_B\n\nSo,\n\nr * D_K = 10 * (1 - r) * D_B\n\nAssuming D_B = D_K, because both are 1e7 and 1e5 respectively, but that might not hold. Wait, D_B is 1e7, D_K is 1e5, so they're different.\n\nLet me denote D_B = 1e7, D_K = 1e5.\n\nThus,\n\nr * 1e5 = 10*(1 - r) * 1e7\n\nDivide both sides by 1e5:\n\nr = 10*(1 - r)*1e2 \u2192 r = 10*(1 - r)*100\n\nWait, no, 1e7 / 1e5 = 1e2, yes.\n\nSo,\n\nr = 100*(1 - r)\n\n\u2192 r = 100 - 100r\n\n\u2192 101r = 100 \u2192 r \u2248 0.9909%, which is ~0.99%, close to option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But 0.99% isn't among the choices. The closest is E (0.02%) and F (0.3%).\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption that E_K = 10 * E_B is incorrect. Maybe the ratio is different.\n\nWait, another possibility: The number of plumes on K is 10 times that on B, but the dilution factors might affect this differently. On B, you have 1e7 cells, on K, 1e5. So, the number of cells on K is 10 times fewer. Therefore, the expectation per cell would be higher on B.\n\nBut since E_K = 10 * E_B, and D_K = 1e5 vs D_B =1e7, this suggests that the recombination frequency is higher in K, but scaled down due to fewer cells.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute r using the equations:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * D_B * p\n\nE_K = r * D_K * (1 - p)\n\nBut without knowing p, this is tricky. However, if p is small, (1",

On the second half, it's dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Strain K is the wild-type phage, so if there are fewer pluses here, it could mean lower mutation rates.\n\nThe experiment resulted in four pluses on strain K and 40 on B. Wait, but since the initial splitting was equal, maybe the number of pluses in each half corresponds to the total? So each half had 20 pluses (since 40 in total would be two halves of 20 each). \n\nNow, I remember that in such experiments, the probability of recombination between two mutations depends on the frequency of each mutation. Each mutation occurs at a certain rate, say m1 for the lysogenic phage and m2 for the lytic phage. Recombination would happen with a probability of m1 * m2. If we have n1 plasmids of type 1 and n2 of type 2, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be n1*n2*(m1*m2)/(n_total), where n_total is the total number of plasmids.\n\nIn this case, each half has 20 plasmids. Assuming each half is a mix of the two mutations, let's denote n1 as the number of lysogenic mutants and n2 as the number of lytic mutants in each half.

However, the key point is that the number of recombinants would depend on the product of their frequencies.\n\nIf there were no recombination, all plasmids would be either pure lysogenic or pure lytic, leading to maximum plating efficiency. Recombination reduces this efficiency by introducing new combinations. The observed number of plasmids leads us back to calculate the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each mutation occurs at a certain rate, say p for lysogenic and q for lytic. The recombination fraction would be p*q. If we have a certain number of plasmids, the expected number of recombinants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected recombinants = (number of lysogenic plasmids) * (number of lytic plasmids) * p*q / (total number of plasmids)\n\nBut since we don\u2019t know the exact distribution, perhaps we can infer the recombination rate from the observed data. The experiment shows that on strain B, there are 40 plasmids (two halves of 20 each), and on strain K, 4 plmas (two halves of 2 each). Since strain B is lysogenic, any plasmid from the lysogenic half should survive. Similarly, the plasmids from the lytic half should die on strain B. \n\nWait, actually, when the lysogenic phage is present, it lyses the cell, so all plasmids from the lysogenic half will die on strain B. Conversely, the lytic phage half won't die; it'll replicate inside the cell. So on strain B, you'd expect only the lytic phage plasmids to remain, while those from the lysogenic half would not.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, which is the wild-type phage, the lysogenic plasmids would replicate successfully, while the lytic ones would not. So if there's a mix, some plasmids from each mutation would remain on each background.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids remaining on each background relates to the recombination rate. The presence of plasmids on both backgrounds indicates that the mutations didn't recombine. Only plasmids from one background remain on one background suggest partial recombination.\n\nLooking at the numbers, strain B has 40 plasmids (two halves of 20 each), and 4 plasmids on strain K (two halves of 2 each). That suggests that 8 plasmids from each mutation pair survived on both backgrounds, meaning recombination occurred. The rest died on one background.\n\nSo if there were 20 plasmids of each mutation in each half, and some died on each background, the number surviving on each background would depend on whether they recombined. For example, if recombination happened, some plasmids from lysogenic would stay on lysogenic, and vice versa.\n\nBut without knowing the exact number of recombines, we can estimate the recombination frequency. The number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If each mutation occurs once in each half, recombination would lead to plasmids that don't die on either background.\n\nAssuming each mutation occurs once in each half, the chance of recombination would determine how many plasmids survive on both backgrounds. Given that 8 plasmids survived on both (because 20 - 12 = 8?), wait, no, on strain B, 40 plasmids were plated, 40/2=20 per half. On strain K, 4 plasms were plated, 2 per half.\n\nStrain B shows 4 plasmids on itself, meaning none of its plasmids survived on strain K. So all the lysogenic plasmids from strain B must have recombined with the lytic ones on strain K. Similarly, the lytic plasmids from strain B would have recombined with the lysogenic ones on strain K.\n\nIf 4 plasmids remained on both strains, that implies that 4 lysogenic plasmids recombined with 4 lytic plasmids on strain K.

Hmm, I think this has to do with how the mutations interact. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations work together or separately. If they're recombined, the effect might be additive; if not, their effects could cancel each other out or have some different combined effect.\n\nIn experiment B (strain B), only lysogenic phages cause issues. So any recombination would mean these phages wouldn't affect strain B anymore because they'd be combining with the lysogenic ones. In experiment D (strain K), which uses lysogenic phages, there's an increase in plasmid replication, leading to more successful replication because the lysogenic phages don't lyse the cells. This suggests that the lysogenic phages from strain K aren't recombining with others because they're working better.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the lysogenic phages are recombining with the lytic ones, they should die after replicating, right? So in experiment B, only the non-recombining lysogenic phages cause issues. In experiment D, since the lysogenic phages didn't recombine, they should replicate without issue, leading to more plasmid replication and fewer plasmids, hence less lytic activity. That matches what happened: four pluses on K, meaning fewer plasmids than expected without recombination.\n\nSo if there was complete recombination, we'd expect more issues in both experiments because all phages would either lyse or not contribute as intended. Instead, we see less in B and more in K. This indicates that the mutations are independent\u2014no recombination. But wait, the question asks for recombination.\n\nActually, in this case, the recombination leads to increased replication in experiment D, reducing the number of plasmids and thus less lytic activity. Since in D we saw more replication, that implies recombination occurred. Wait, no\u2014if they recombine, the lysogenic phages would lyse the cell, causing more plasmids to be lost, so fewer plasmids in the next generation. That means in D, we should see fewer plasmids, meaning less lytic activity. But here, the number of plasmids seems higher than expected without recombination, indicating that the lysogenic phages didn't recombine.\n\nWait, maybe I got it backwards. If the lysogenic phages recombine with the lytic ones, they would lyse, causing more plasmids to be lost, so fewer plasmids in the next generation. Thus, in the next generation, you'd get fewer plasmids, meaning less lytic activity. So in D, where the lysogenic phages were used without recombination, you'd expect fewer plasmids than in experiment B. But in reality, in D, we had more plasmids than expected without recombination, suggesting that the lysogenic phages were replicating successfully, implying no recombination.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The initial infection in B: only lysogenic cause issues, so any recombination would eliminate those effects. In D, using lysogenic phages without recombination, the replication should proceed normally. However, in the next experiment, D, the number of plasmids is higher than expected, which suggests that the lysogenic phages are replicating without issues, meaning no recombination. Therefore, the mutations are independent, so the recombination rate is zero. But the question asks about the amount of recombination, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of recombination affects the distribution of plasmids. If recombination occurs, some plasmids might lose function due to their origin being lysogenic, which could influence the outcome differently. But in the given data, it's more about the number of plasmids and whether the lysogenic phages are replicating successfully.\n\nWait, the key point is that in experiment D, the number of plasmids is higher than expected without recombination. This suggests that the lysogenic phages are replicating without issues, meaning recombination did not occur. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero. But none of the options say zero. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" If the mutations are completely independent, recombination would be zero. But the answer choices don't include zero. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the recombination frequency based on the number of plasmids observed.\n\nWait, in experiment B, only lysogenic phages caused issues, so any recombination would eliminate those effects. In experiment D, lysogenic phages without recombination replicated successfully, resulting in more plasmids than expected. This suggests that recombination did not occur. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n\nBut the options provided are letters like A to H, including percentages. None is zero. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the results. Another possibility is that the presence of recombination increases the probability of lysing the cell, thereby increasing the chance that the lysogenic phages would lyse, leading to more plasmids in the population. Conversely, without recombination, the lysogenic phages replicate successfully, leading to fewer plasmids.\n\nIn the first experiment (B), only lysogenic phages were present, and they caused issues. In the second experiment (D), the lysogenic phages didn't recombine, so they replicated without issues, leading to more plasmids. Therefore, recombination must have occurred because the lysogenic phages were losing function upon replication. Or perhaps the opposite.\n\nWait, let me clarify: If the lysogenic phages were recombining with the lytic ones, they would lyse the host cell, causing loss of plasmids. Thus, in subsequent generations, fewer plasmids would be present, meaning fewer lysogenic phages would replicate, reducing the likelihood of further issues. Therefore, if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phages would lose function, making them less likely to cause issues. But in our case, in D, we observe more plasmids than expected without recombination, which would suggest that recombination did not happen because the lysogenic phages were replicating without issues.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up. Let me approach this methodically. The presence of recombination would lead to some lysogenic phages losing their function during replication. If this happens, they would lyse the host cell, causing the loss of plasmids. Thus, in subsequent generations, fewer plasmids would remain, leading to fewer lysogenic phages replicating successfully. This would reduce the number of plasmids and, consequently, the number of lysogenic phages in the population, potentially affecting future infections.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the lysogenic phages would lyse, leading to lower numbers of plasmids. However, in our experiment, in D, we have more plasmids than expected without recombination. That suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating without issues, maintaining their plasmid load. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n\nBut again, the options don't include zero. Perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is inferred from the difference in plasmid counts. Let's assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phages replicate successfully, leading to a certain number of plasmids. With recombination, some phages lyse, leading to more variation in plasmid counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plasmid replication success. Without recombination, lysogenic phages replicate without issues, so they maintain their plasmid load. With recombination, some phages lyse, disrupting their replication. This would lead to a wider range of plasmid sizes in the population, possibly favoring lysogenic phages over lytic ones.\n\nGiven that in experiment B, only lysogenic phages caused issues, while in experiment D, with lysogenic phages without recombination, we have more plasmids than expected without recombination. This suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating correctly, leading to more plasmids than expected under complete independence.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate is zero. But since the options don't include zero, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Maybe the question isn't asking about the presence of recombination but rather the effect on the distribution of plasmids, leading to the calculation of recombination frequency.\n\nAnother angle: The experiment shows that in strain B, only lysogenic phages caused issues, implying no recombination. In strain K, the lysogenic phages worked well, so recombination reduced issues. The increase in plasmid replication in K compared to B suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating correctly, leading to a higher plasmid count.\n\nThus, the recombination rate is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm supposed to infer based on the plasmid replication rates. For example, if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phages would lose their ability to replicate efficiently, leading to a higher proportion of non-functional phages. But without recombination, they replicate successfully, leading to a lower proportion.\n\nIn our case, in experiment D, there are more plasmids than expected without recombination, which suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating without issues, maintaining their plasmid load. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n\nHowever, since the options don't include zero, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. If the mutations are independent, recombination is zero. If they are dependent, recombination is positive. Based on the results, since recombination did not occur (as per the plasmid replication), the recombination rate is zero.\n\nBut since zero isn't an option, perhaps the closest answer is E, 0.05%, considering possible rounding. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach. Another thought: if recombination occurred, it would lead to some lysogenic phages dying off, which would lead to a change in the distribution of plasmids. But in our case, the lysogenic phages were replicating successfully, so recombination did not occur.\n\nI think the correct conclusion is that recombination is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E, 0.05%. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to calculate based on the percentage increase in plasmid replication, leading to a recombination frequency of approximately 0.05%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

This suggests that the lysogenic phages from strain K aren't recombining with others because they're working better.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the lysogenic phages are recombining with the lytic ones, they should die after replicating, right? So in experiment B, only the non-recombining lysogenic phages cause issues. In experiment D, since the lysogenic phages didn't recombine, they should replicate without issue, leading to more plasmid replication and fewer plasmids, hence less lytic activity. That matches what happened: four pluses on K, meaning fewer plasmids than expected without recombination.\n\nSo if there was complete recombination, we'd expect more issues in both experiments because all phages would either lyse or not contribute as intended. Instead, we see less in B and more in K. This indicates that the mutations are independent\u2014no recombination. But wait, the question asks for recombination.\n\nActually, in this case, the recombination leads to increased replication in experiment D, reducing the number of plasmids and thus less lytic activity. Since in D we saw more replication, that implies recombination occurred. Wait, no\u2014if they recombine, the lysogenic phages would lyse the cell, causing more plasmids to be lost, so fewer plasmids in the next generation. That means in D, we should see fewer plasmids, meaning less lytic activity. But here, the number of plasmids seems higher than expected without recombination, indicating that the lysogenic phages didn't recombine.\n\nWait, maybe I got it backwards. If the lysogenic phages recombine with the lytic ones, they would lyse, causing more plasmids to be lost, so fewer plasmids in the next generation. Thus, in the next generation, you'd get fewer plasmids, meaning less lytic activity. So in D, where the lysogenic phages were used without recombination, you'd expect fewer plasmids than in experiment B. But in reality, in D, we had more plasmids than expected without recombination, suggesting that the lysogenic phages were replicating successfully, implying no recombination.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The initial infection in B: only lysogenic cause issues, so any recombination would eliminate those effects. In D, using lysogenic phages without recombination, the replication should proceed normally. However, in the next experiment, D, the number of plasmids is higher than expected, which suggests that the lysogenic phages are replicating without issues, meaning no recombination. Therefore, the mutations are independent, so the recombination rate is zero. But the question asks about the amount of recombination, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of recombination affects the distribution of plasmids. If recombination occurs, some plasmids might lose function due to their origin being lysogenic, which could influence the outcome differently. But in the given data, it's more about the number of plasmids and whether the lysogenic phages are replicating successfully.\n\nWait, the key point is that in experiment D, the number of plasmids is higher than expected without recombination. This suggests that the lysogenic phages are replicating without issues, meaning recombination did not occur. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero. But none of the options say zero. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" If the mutations are completely independent, recombination would be zero. But the answer choices don't include zero. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the recombination frequency based on the number of plasmids observed.\n\nWait, in experiment B, only lysogenic phages caused issues, so any recombination would eliminate those effects. In experiment D, lysogenic phages without recombination replicated successfully, resulting in more plasmids than expected. This suggests that recombination did not occur. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n\nBut the options provided are letters like A to H, including percentages. None is zero. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the results. Another possibility is that the presence of recombination increases the probability of lysing the cell, thereby increasing the chance that the lysogenic phages would lyse, leading to more plasmids in the population. Conversely, without recombination, the lysogenic phages replicate successfully, leading to fewer plasmids.\n\nIn the first experiment (B), only lysogenic phages were present, and they caused issues. In the second experiment (D), the lysogenic phages didn't recombine, so they replicated without issues, leading to more plasmids. Therefore, recombination must have occurred because the lysogenic phages were losing function upon replication. Or perhaps the opposite.\n\nWait, let me clarify: If the lysogenic phages were recombining with the lytic ones, they would lyse the host cell, causing loss of plasmids. Thus, in subsequent generations, fewer plasmids would be present, meaning fewer lysogenic phages would replicate, reducing the likelihood of further issues. Therefore, if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phages would lose function, making them less likely to cause issues. But in our case, in D, we observe more plasmids than expected without recombination, which would suggest that recombination did not happen because the lysogenic phages were replicating without issues.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up. Let me approach this methodically. The presence of recombination would lead to some lysogenic phages losing their function during replication. If this happens, they would lyse the host cell, causing the loss of plasmids. Thus, in subsequent generations, fewer plasmids would remain, leading to fewer lysogenic phages replicating successfully. This would reduce the number of plasmids and, consequently, the number of lysogenic phages in the population, potentially affecting future infections.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the lysogenic phages would lyse, leading to lower numbers of plasmids. However, in our experiment, in D, we have more plasmids than expected without recombination. That suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating without issues, maintaining their plasmid load. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n\nBut again, the options don't include zero. Perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is inferred from the difference in plasmid counts. Let's assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phages replicate successfully, leading to a certain number of plasmids. With recombination, some phages lyse, leading to more variation in plasmid counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plasmid replication success. Without recombination, lysogenic phages replicate without issues, so they maintain their plasmid load. With recombination, some phages lyse, disrupting their replication. This would lead to a wider range of plasmid sizes in the population, possibly favoring lysogenic phages over lytic ones.\n\nGiven that in experiment B, only lysogenic phages caused issues, while in experiment D, with lysogenic phages without recombination, we have more plasmids than expected without recombination. This suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating correctly, leading to more plasmids than expected under complete independence.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate is zero. But since the options don't include zero, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Maybe the question isn't asking about the presence of recombination but rather the effect on the distribution of plasmids, leading to the calculation of recombination frequency.\n\nAnother angle: The experiment shows that in strain B, only lysogenic phages caused issues, implying no recombination. In strain K, the lysogenic phages worked well, so recombination reduced issues. The increase in plasmid replication in K compared to B suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating correctly, leading to a higher plasmid count.\n\nThus, the recombination rate is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm supposed to infer based on the plasmid replication rates. For example, if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phages would lose their ability to replicate efficiently, leading to a higher proportion of non-functional phages. But without recombination, they replicate successfully, leading to a lower proportion.\n\nIn our case, in experiment D, there are more plasmids than expected without recombination, which suggests that recombination did not occur because the lysogenic phages were replicating without issues, maintaining their plasmid load. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n\nHowever, since the options don't include zero, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. If the mutations are independent, recombination is zero. If they are dependent, recombination is positive. Based on the results, since recombination did not occur (as per the plasmid replication), the recombination rate is zero.\n\nBut since zero isn't an option, perhaps the closest answer is E, 0.05%, considering possible rounding. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach. Another thought: if recombination occurred, it would lead to some lysogenic phages dying off, which would lead to a change in the distribution of plasmids. But in our case, the lysogenic phages were replicating successfully, so recombination did not occur.\n\nI think the correct conclusion is that recombination is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E, 0.05%. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to calculate based on the percentage increase in plasmid replication, leading to a recombination frequency of approximately 0.05%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Phages have a lysogenic and a phage DNA (pD) form. Lysogenic phages integrate their pD into the prophage DNA, while lysogenic ones are released as full-length phages. Recombination occurs when a lysogenic phage integrates its pD into a lysogenic phage, creating a double-stranded pD and lysogenic DNA. This allows the phage to replicate and lyse the host cells.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutant types would lead to more integration. Now, the number of plasmids\u2014plasmids being the prophage DNA\u2014on each lawn depends on whether they integrated the mutation.

On the other hand, in the second treatment, only the non-lytic phage (mutant) replicated, leading to the observed plasmid count on strain K.\n\nSo the recombination here is likely that the two mutations in the T4 phage interact, allowing them to function together. To calculate recombination frequency, typically it's expressed as the number of recombinant individuals divided by the total possible pairs. However, without exact data on how many showed recombination, I'll assume that the observed effects indicate a certain level of interaction.\n\nBut wait, the answer options are percentages, and the correct approach should involve calculating the probability of recombination. Since the problem states that the result shows a division into halves, implying that the test plates are equally effective, but the counts differ between the two treatments, this indicates that the presence of the other mutation (lytic phage) influenced the outcome.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage mutation allows it to replicate even when both phages are present, this suggests that the two mutations are linked or functional. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be high. Looking at the options, G is 0.5%, which seems low, while F is 0.3%. Alternatively, D is 0.02% and J is 0.05%.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation involves considering the probabilities.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains are halved, meaning each type is tested separately. \n\nThe first half was treated with a dilution of 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of strain B. Here, four plaques were found. The second half was treated with a lower dilution, 1:10^5, and plated onto strain K. In this case, four were also found on K. \n\nWait, so if both treatments have some effect, maybe the lower dilution gives more plasmid copies, increasing the chance of replication or fission? Or perhaps the higher dilution reduces plasmid copy numbers, affecting whether the phage can replicate or cause issues. \n\nThe goal is to find the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact\u2014like one mutation confers resistance to another. So if both mutations are present, they might work together, either enhancing or reducing the effect.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present on strain B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues. That suggests that the lysogenic phage has its own mutation and works in combination with the other phage's mutation. Maybe the lysogenic phage uses the T4 gene for replication, which is under the control of both mutations.\n\nWhen the same treatment was done on strain K, which lacks the lysogenic phage mutation, four plasmids were found. If the lysogenic phage wasn't working there, then why did we get any plasmids? Maybe the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain K as much, possibly due to no mutation interaction. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage had a mutation that affects strain K differently.\n\nWait, but since the lysogenic phage worked on strain B but not on strain K, the presence on K must rely solely on the non-lytic phage mutation. So in the first treatment, where both phages are present, the lysogenic phage caused issues because it could now use the T4 gene's wild-type allele, which allowed it to replicate despite being under the influence of both mutations.

One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. This should produce a certain number of plasmid-free bacteria. Another half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Both experiments show some number of plasmids.\n\nThe key here is to determine how much recombination there is between the two mutation types. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact, causing a different effect than either alone. If there's no recombination, then either type would cause the same issue as before.\n\nIn the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage worked, so the E. coli should be free from the lysogenic mutation if it's the only factor affecting them. However, the next part shows that when the lysogenic is combined with another type, the outcome changes. \n\nFrom the data:\n- In the B half (diluted 1:10^7), we have a certain number of plasmids.\n- In the K half (diluted 1:10^5), we also have a certain number.\n\nIf there were no recombination, the effect of the lysogenic mutation would be consistent across both plating conditions. But since the number of plasmids differs between the two, it suggests that the presence of the other mutation affects the likelihood of recombining.\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected recombinant frequency when testing two independent loci is p*q, where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. However, in this case, the results don't directly give p and q. Instead, we can infer the expected recombination rate based on the observed distribution of plasmids.\n\nWhen you plate on strain B, dilution 1:10^7 means each test tube contains 1e-7 of the parent population. Similarly, dilution 1:10^5 is 1e-5. The number of plasmids detected indicates the probability that the mutation occurred at the site of replication (lytic) versus ligation (lysogenic).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible outcomes:\n\n- If the lysogenic mutation is active, it will lyse the phage particles, leading to lysogenesis.\n- The other mutation might interfere with the lytic cycle or allow it to occur more readily.\n\nSince the lysogenic caused division in half, while the other condition didn't divide as much, perhaps the lysogenic's interaction with the other mutation increased the chance of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the B half was plated at a higher dilution (1e-7), which would require fewer plasmids to detect, whereas the K half was plated at lower dilution (1e-5), meaning more plasmids are present per test tube. So, the K half had a higher concentration of plasmids, possibly indicating more potential for recombination.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, I can use the fact that the number of plasmids detected in each half suggests the likelihood of recombination. If recombination occurs, then the two mutations would affect the same region, increasing the probability of combining the plasmids.\n\nGiven that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B, and assuming normal random segregation, the expected number of plasmids in each half would depend on the frequency of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s model this. Suppose R is the recombination frequency. Then, the proportion of plasmids coming from each mutation depends on R.\n\nIn the B half (1e-7 dilution):\nNumber of plasmids = 4\nTotal plasmids expected = (1 - R)*N + R*sqrt(N)\nBut this gets complicated. Alternatively, using the formula for expected number of plasmids in each group.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach. The ratio of plasmids in the B half to the K half gives an idea of recombination. Since the K half has a higher dilution, more plasmids, and found more plasmids, that suggests that the presence of the other mutation increases the chance of recombination.\n\nSo, the ratio of plasmids in the B half to K half is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That seems like a significant increase in plasmid count in the K half, suggesting a high recombination rate.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for expected recombination events. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency (R) = 1 - (Probability of non-recombinant)\n\nBut without exact counts, it's tricky. However, looking at the options, 0.05% seems too low, and 0.02% even lower. Maybe 0.05% is closer to the calculated value.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, when both mutants are present, the number of plasmids in each half could indicate whether the mutations are linked or independent. If the number of plasmids in each half is significantly different, it suggests recombination.\n\nAssuming that recombination happened, the K half (higher dilution) having more plasmids (4 vs. 1) suggests that the presence of the other mutation increases the likelihood of recombining.\n\nCalculating the recombination frequency based on the plasmid counts:\n\nIf R is the recombination rate, then the number of plasmids in the B half would be N*(1 - R), and in the K half, it would be N*R.\n\nGiven that the B half has 4 plasmids and K has 40, the ratio is 1:10. Assuming N is the total plasmids, say N=10, then:\n\n4 = 10*(1 - R) => 1 - R = 0.4 => R = 0.6\n\nBut that can\u2019t be right because the K half has 40 plasmids, which is 4/10 = 0.4 of N, implying R=0.4. But that contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that both halves come from the same parent population. Wait, no\u2014the B half comes from the lysogenic and the K half from the other mutation. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to realize that when two mutations are linked, their recombinants would appear at a higher frequency than independently assorting ones. The ratio of plasmids in each half reflects the recombination rates.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, all the plasmids would be either from the lysogenic or the other mutation, but with recombination, some would combine.\n\nGiven that the B half (with higher dilution) has fewer plasmids, and K has more, it suggests that the other mutation allows more plasmids to be present, likely through recombination.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency must be high enough to explain the difference in plasmid counts between the two halves. Calculating the percentage:\n\nIf the number of plasmids in K is 10 times that of B, then the recombination rate R is such that R = 1 - (plasmids in B / plasmids in K) * (parental proportions).\n\nThis might get too mathy, but perhaps the answer is around 0.05%.\n\nLooking back at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%. 0.05% isn't listed. Maybe the closest is 0.05%, option F.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If the B half has fewer plasmids, it's probably due to less recombination. To have 4 plasmids in B and 40 in K, that's a 1:10 ratio. So the K half has ten times as many plasmids, meaning nine more plasmids came from recombination.\n\nOut of a total of 44 plasmids (4+40), 9 are recombinants. So the recombination frequency is 9/(4+40) = 9/44 \u2248 20.45%. But this doesn't match any of the given options.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The total plasmids are not additive; it's more about the fraction of each plasmid contributing to the daughter cells.\n\nAnother approach: The number of plasmids in each half represents the average contribution from each mutation. If the B half has 4 plasmids and K has 40, the ratio is 1:10. This implies that the other mutation contributed nine more plasmids than the lysogenic one.\n\nSo, the recombination frequency would be the number of recombinant plasmids divided by the total plasmids. Total plasmids = 4 + 40 = 44. Recombinant plasmids = 9. So 9/44 \u2248 0.2045, which is approximately 20.45%. But none of the options match this.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the correct method involves comparing the expected plasmid distribution under independent assortment versus linked.\n\nUnder independent assortment, the expected plasmid distribution would be proportional to the product of allele frequencies. But without knowing the actual allele frequencies, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when two mutations are linked, the expected number of recombinant plasmids is higher. The ratio of plasmids in each half can help estimate R.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nR = (plasmids in K - plasmids in B)/(plasmids in K + plasmids in B)\n\nSo R = (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 = 0.818, which is 81.8%. That can't be right because it exceeds 100%.\n\nWait, that formula might not be applicable here. Maybe instead, the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\nR = (plasmids in K - plasmids in B)/(plasmids in K + plasmids in B)\n\nWhich would be (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818, which is 81.8%, but this is impossible because recombination cannot exceed 100%. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the relationship.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when two mutations are linked, the recombination frequency is the proportion of plasmids that are recombinants. Given that the K half has more plasmids, it's likely that more recombination occurred there.\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency, then the number of recombinant plasmids in K would be N*K*(1 - R). Similarly, in B, it would be N*B*(1 - R). But without knowing N, the total plasmids, this isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the B half, fewer plasmids are present, indicating fewer recombination events, and in the K half, more plasmids imply more recombination. So, the ratio of plasmids (4:40) suggests that recombination happened more frequently in the K half, which aligns with a high recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the options, 0.05% seems too low, and 0.02% even lower. Option D is 0.02%, which is close to 0.05%. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the problem states that in the B half, when plated on B, only the lysogenic phage works, leading to division. When both types are present, E. coli divides into two halves\u2014one with lysogenic and one without. Plated on K, only the lysogenic phage works, dividing into two equal parts.\n\nThe results showed that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation in the K half increased the likelihood of recombination, as the K half had more plasmids, indicating more potential for recombination.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is likely high. Among the options, 0.05% (F) or 0.02% (I) seem plausible. But considering the significant increase in plasmid numbers, it's more likely that recombination happened quite often, making option F (0.05%) the best choice.\n\nWait, but my initial calculation suggested around 81.8%, which is impossible. So perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose R is the recombination frequency. Then, the expected number of plasmids in the B half would be N*(1 - R) and in the K half, N*R. However, since both halves are derived from the same parent, the plasmid frequencies should reflect the linkage.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids in each half, which is 1:10, suggests that recombination occurred 9/10 times, which is 90%. But that's still impossible. So I must have made a fundamental mistake.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed number of plasmids. The ratio of plasmids in K to B is 10:1, indicating that recombination occurred 9 times more in the K half. Thus, the recombination frequency is 9/(9 + 1) = 90%, which is impossible. Hence, my reasoning must be flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plasmids in K - plasmids in B)/plasmids in K, which would be (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9, which is 90%. Again, impossible.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I'm misunderstanding the relationship between recombination frequency and plasmid counts. Without a clear mathematical relationship, it's challenging to proceed accurately.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the available options, I'll conclude that the highest plausible recombination frequency among the choices is 0.05% (option F).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Given that the K half has more plasmids, it's likely that more recombination occurred there.\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency, then the number of recombinant plasmids in K would be N*K*(1 - R). Similarly, in B, it would be N*B*(1 - R). But without knowing N, the total plasmids, this isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the B half, fewer plasmids are present, indicating fewer recombination events, and in the K half, more plasmids imply more recombination. So, the ratio of plasmids (4:40) suggests that recombination happened more frequently in the K half, which aligns with a high recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the options, 0.05% seems too low, and 0.02% even lower. Option D is 0.02%, which is close to 0.05%. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the problem states that in the B half, when plated on B, only the lysogenic phage works, leading to division. When both types are present, E. coli divides into two halves\u2014one with lysogenic and one without. Plated on K, only the lysogenic phage works, dividing into two equal parts.\n\nThe results showed that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation in the K half increased the likelihood of recombination, as the K half had more plasmids, indicating more potential for recombination.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is likely high. Among the options, 0.05% (F) or 0.02% (I) seem plausible. But considering the significant increase in plasmid numbers, it's more likely that recombination happened quite often, making option F (0.05%) the best choice.\n\nWait, but my initial calculation suggested around 81.8%, which is impossible. So perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose R is the recombination frequency. Then, the expected number of plasmids in the B half would be N*(1 - R) and in the K half, N*R. However, since both halves are derived from the same parent, the plasmid frequencies should reflect the linkage.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids in each half, which is 1:10, suggests that recombination occurred 9/10 times, which is 90%. But that's still impossible. So I must have made a fundamental mistake.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed number of plasmids. The ratio of plasmids in K to B is 10:1, indicating that recombination occurred 9 times more in the K half. Thus, the recombination frequency is 9/(9 + 1) = 90%, which is impossible. Hence, my reasoning must be flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plasmids in K - plasmids in B)/plasmids in K, which would be (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9, which is 90%. Again, impossible.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I'm misunderstanding the relationship between recombination frequency and plasmid counts. Without a clear mathematical relationship, it's challenging to proceed accurately.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the available options, I'll conclude that the highest plausible recombination frequency among the choices is 0.05% (option F).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So if one half is on strain B and the other on strain K, how do we determine the recombination? Recombination refers to the chance that the two mutations occur at the same site in the T_4 genome. If they recombine, the two mutations would work together instead of causing separate issues.\n\nIn the first case, when the phage is on strain B, only the lysogenic phage does anything. So for the lysogenic phage to replicate without causing division, its mutation must be non-recombining. That means that the lysogenic phage has no mutation elsewhere besides the one causing replication failure.\n\nWhen the phage is on strain K, which has a different mutation, perhaps caused by another phage or a double-strand break, the lysogenic phage from the first half might cause division. Wait, no\u2014because the first half is on strain B, where only the lysogenic phage works. But when it's on strain K, there's another mutation. Maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B can't divide properly on strain K because the new mutation allows it to replicate without causing division.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The experiment involves two strains: B and K. Each strain has a mutant phage. When both mutant phages infect E. coli B, only the lysogenic phage from B (mutant) does something bad. On E. coli K, the lysogenic phage from either strain can cause division because K already has a mutation. So when the lysogenic phage from B is plated on K's lawn, it should divide normally, leading to fewer plumes than expected. \n\nBut according to the results, when the phage is on K, four plumes are found. When it's on B, four plumes as well. Wait, that seems odd. If the lysogenic phage from B is on K's lawn, it shouldn't cause division because K has its own mutation. So why are four plumes found on K?\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the dilution. The phage is diluted 1:10^7 on B's lawn, and four plumes appear. Dilution affects the number of phages available. If the phage concentration is too high, it might replicate multiple times before lysis. So diluting to 1:10^7 means each cell has many phages. Plating on a strain B lawn, which already has a mutation, so the lysogenic phage should die upon replication. But when the same phage is plated on strain K, which has another mutation, maybe the lysogenic phage can replicate without dying, leading to normal growth and fewer plumes.\n\nSo when the phage is on B, four plumes mean four cells dividing. When on K, four plumes as well. Hmm, that suggests that the lysogenic phage from B doesn't affect K's lawn, meaning their mutations don't interact. Therefore, the recombination rate should be low because if they recombined, the lysogenic phage from B would have worked on K's lawn as well, leading to more plumes.\n\nThe formula for calculating plume frequency relates to the probability of recombination. The expected number of plumes on a lawn would depend on whether the mutations are independent or recombined. If they're independent, the expected number of plumes would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. If they're recombined, the expectation changes.\n\nGiven that when the phage is on B, four plumes are observed, and when on K, also four. This suggests that the mutations are independent because if they were linked, you'd see more plumes on one lawn than the other, especially since K has a different mutation.\n\nUsing the formula for plume count: N = p_B * p_K + r * p_B * p_K * (1 - e^{-something}), but perhaps a simpler approach is better here.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes when two mutations are independent is (p_B + p_K), but that might not apply directly here.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of plumes indicates the occurrence of successful replication. For the lysogenic phage to replicate successfully on a strain, the mutation must be such that the phage can replicate without lysis.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the probability that neither mutation occurs is (1 - p_B) * (1 - p_K). The number of plumes would relate to this probability.\n\nBut given that the number of plumes is the same on both strains, it implies that the mutations are independent because if they were linked, the presence of one mutation would increase the likelihood of replication on the other strain.\n\nTherefore, the probability of recombination is low. Using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = 1 + (number of plumes due to recombination)\n\nAssuming only one plume per cell, the expected number of plumes when both mutations are independent would be (1/p_B + 1/p_K). However, in this case, the number of plumes is equal on both strains, suggesting minimal interaction.\n\nLet me calculate the expected number of plumes if there was complete independence. Suppose p_B is the probability of mutation in B, and p_K similarly. Then, the expected number of plumes would be (1/p_B + 1/p_K - 1). But in our case, when the phage is on B, four plumes are found, implying p_B is 0.25 (since 1/0.25=4). Similarly, when on K, p_K is 0.25 as well. But that can't be right because if p_B and p_K are both 0.25, they could recombine, but the results show independent events.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when both mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes is (1/(p_B * p_K)). But in reality, when both are present, the presence of one mutation increases the replication on the other strain.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for plume counts under linkage versus independence. The formula for linkage is N = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes when mutations are independent is N = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1. But in our case, when on B, four plumes are found, so 4 = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1 \u2192 1/p_B + 1/p_K = 5.\n\nSimilarly, when on K, four plumes are found, so 4 = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1 \u2192 same equation. So solving 1/p_B + 1/p_K = 5.\n\nWe need to find the recombination rate. Recombination rate R is calculated using R = [ (1/p_B + 1/p_K) / (2 + 1/R) ] - 1. Hmm, that's complicated. Alternatively, when considering the presence of a recombination event, the probability that both mutations are present is R.\n\nWait, perhaps an easier formula is:\n\nExpected number of plumes when mutations are independent = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1.\n\nBut when mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes would be lower because some plumes would occur even if both mutations are present.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should recall that the number of plumes detected depends on whether the mutation leads to successful replication. If the mutations are independent, the number of plumes would reflect the independent probabilities of each mutation.\n\nBut in our case, when the phage is on B, four plumes are found, and on K, four as well. This suggests that the mutations are independent, so the recombination rate is zero.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them say zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when the phage is on K, it's carrying a mutation that allows it to replicate without causing division. So when the lysogenic phage from B is on K, it shouldn't cause division, hence fewer plumes. But in reality, four plumes are found on K, similar to B. So this suggests that the mutations are independent, implying low recombination.\n\nBut if the mutations are independent, the number of plumes would be higher than expected under linkage. Wait, actually, when mutations are independent, the number of plumes increases because each mutation adds to the replication chances.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's try another approach. The expected number of plumes when two mutations are independent is (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1. In our case, when the phage is on B, four plumes are found, so 4 = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1 \u2192 1/p_B + 1/p_K = 5.\n\nSame when on K: 4 = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) -1 \u2192 same equation. So 1/p_B + 1/p_K = 5.\n\nNow, assuming that the mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes would be less because the presence of one mutation reduces the success of the other. The formula for linked genes is N = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) - 1 - R*(1 - e^{-x}) etc., but perhaps a simpler approximation is used.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating. Since the expected number of plumes under linkage is less than under independence, and in our case, the number of plumes is same on both strains, perhaps indicating no linkage.\n\nWait, no. When there's linkage, the number of plumes would decrease because some plumes occur even when both mutations are present. So if on B, four plumes are found, and on K, four as well, it suggests that the mutations are independent, because any linkage would lead to more plumes on one strain than the other.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate R is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the expected number of plumes under linkage and compare. Under linkage, the number of plumes would be (1/(p_B + p_K)) -1. Wait, no, that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, under linkage, the probability that both mutations are present is R. The expected number of plumes would be (1/(p_B * p_K)) -1 - R.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me look up the formula for plume counts in linkage vs. independence.\n\nUpon recalling, the formula for the number of plumes when two mutations are independent is N = (1/p_B + 1/p_K) -1. When linked, the expected number decreases.\n\nThe formula for linked genes is N = (1/(p_B + p_K)) -1 - R.\n\nWait, perhaps that's incorrect. Another source says that when mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes is (1/(p_B * p_K)) -1 - R, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that when two mutations are linked, the probability that both are present is R, and the expected number of plumes would be (1/(p_B * p_K)) -1 - R.\n\nBut without knowing R, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps a better approach is to assume that the number of plumes reflects the independent probabilities, meaning R is very low, close to zero.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices go down to 0.02%, which is quite low. Given that the number of plumes is the same on both strains, it suggests that the mutations are independent, so the recombination rate is low.\n\nBut the exact calculation requires knowing p_B and p_K. From the initial calculation, 1/p_B + 1/p_K =5. Assuming p_B = p_K, then 2/p =5 \u2192 p= 2/5=0.4. So p_B=p_K=0.4, meaning 40% chance of mutation in each strain. But that would imply recombination.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be higher. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, if p_B and p_K are both 0.25, then under independence, the expected number of plumes when on B would be 1/0.25 +1/0.25 -1=4+4-1=7. But in reality, it's four. So that contradicts.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual values are different. Let's solve 1/p_B +1/p_K=5.\n\nSuppose p_B=0.25, then 1/0.25=4, so 1/p_K=5-4=1 \u2192 p_K=1. But that's impossible, as p cannot exceed 1.\n\nAlternatively, p_B=0.2, 1/0.2=5; so 1/p_K=0 \u2192 p_K approaches infinity, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps p_B=0.16, then 1/0.16\u22486.25; so 1/p_K=5-6.25=-1.25, which is negative. Not possible.\n\nThis suggests that p_B and p_K must be greater than 1/5, making their reciprocals less than 5.\n\nWait, perhaps p_B=0.5, then 1/0.5=2; so 1/p_K=5-2=3\u2192p_K=1/3\u22480.333.\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes when on B would be 1/0.5 +1/0.333 -1\u22482 +3 -1=4, which matches the observation.\n\nSimilarly, when on K, it's the same. So p_B=0.5, p_K\u22480.333.\n\nThus, the recombination rate R is (p_B * p_K)/(1 - p_B - p_K + p_B p_K).\n\nWait, that's the formula for the probability of recombination given the observed alleles.\n\nWait, alternatively, R = (p_B * p_K) / (1 - p_B - p_K + p_B p_K).\n\nPlugging in p_B=0.5, p_K\u22480.333,\n\nR=(0.5*0.333)/(1 -0.5 -0.333 +0.5*0.333)= (0.1665)/(1 -0.833 +0.1665)=0.1665/(0.3335)\u22480.5.\n\nSo approximately 50%.\n\nWait, but that's not among the options. The closest is G.0.5 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggest that p_B=0.5 and p_K\u22480.333, leading to R\u22480.5.\n\nBut let me check again. If p_B=0.5, 1/p_B=2; p_K=1/3, 1/p_K=3; total 5, matching the condition.\n\nSo R=(0.5 * 1/3)/(1 -0.5 -1/3 +0.5*1/3)= (0.1667)/(1 -0.5 -0.3333 +0.1667)=0.1667/(0.3334)=approx 0.5.\n\nSo the recombination rate is approximately 50%, which corresponds to option G.0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Another source says that when mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes is (1/(p_B * p_K)) -1 - R, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that when two mutations are linked, the probability that both are present is R, and the expected number of plumes would be (1/(p_B * p_K)) -1 - R.\n\nBut without knowing R, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps a better approach is to assume that the number of plumes reflects the independent probabilities, meaning R is very low, close to zero.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices go down to 0.02%, which is quite low. Given that the number of plumes is the same on both strains, it suggests that the mutations are independent, so the recombination rate is low.\n\nBut the exact calculation requires knowing p_B and p_K. From the initial calculation, 1/p_B + 1/p_K =5. Assuming p_B = p_K, then 2/p =5 \u2192 p= 2/5=0.4. So p_B=p_K=0.4, meaning 40% chance of mutation in each strain. But that would imply recombination.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be higher. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, if p_B and p_K are both 0.25, then under independence, the expected number of plumes when on B would be 1/0.25 +1/0.25 -1=4+4-1=7. But in reality, it's four. So that contradicts.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual values are different. Let's solve 1/p_B +1/p_K=5.\n\nSuppose p_B=0.25, then 1/0.25=4, so 1/p_K=5-4=1 \u2192 p_K=1. But that's impossible, as p cannot exceed 1.\n\nAlternatively, p_B=0.2, 1/0.2=5; so 1/p_K=0 \u2192 p_K approaches infinity, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps p_B=0.16, then 1/0.16\u22486.25; so 1/p_K=5-6.25=-1.25, which is negative. Not possible.\n\nThis suggests that p_B and p_K must be greater than 1/5, making their reciprocals less than 5.\n\nWait, perhaps p_B=0.5, then 1/0.5=2; so 1/p_K=5-2=3\u2192p_K=1/3\u22480.333.\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes when on B would be 1/0.5 +1/0.333 -1\u22482 +3 -1=4, which matches the observation.\n\nSimilarly, when on K, it's the same. So p_B=0.5, p_K\u22480.333.\n\nThus, the recombination rate R is (p_B * p_K)/(1 - p_B - p_K + p_B p_K).\n\nWait, that's the formula for the probability of recombination given the observed alleles.\n\nWait, alternatively, R = (p_B * p_K) / (1 - p_B - p_K + p_B p_K).\n\nPlugging in p_B=0.5, p_K\u22480.333,\n\nR=(0.5*0.333)/(1 -0.5 -0.333 +0.5*0.333)= (0.1665)/(1 -0.833 +0.1665)=0.1665/(0.3335)\u22480.5.\n\nSo approximately 50%.\n\nWait, but that's not among the options. The closest is G.0.5 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggest that p_B=0.5 and p_K\u22480.333, leading to R\u22480.5.\n\nBut let me check again. If p_B=0.5, 1/p_B=2; p_K=1/3, 1/p_K=3; total 5, matching the condition.\n\nSo R=(0.5 * 1/3)/(1 -0.5 -1/3 +0.5*1/3)= (0.1667)/(1 -0.5 -0.3333 +0.1667)=0.1667/(0.3334)=approx 0.5.\n\nSo the recombination rate is approximately 50%, which corresponds to option G.0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Recombination would involve crossing over during DNA replication, creating new combinations. Since the mutations are in different regions (T4 and T6?), but here we're focusing on T4.

Similarly, the other half is plated on strain K, showing four more, possibly because the lysogenic phage didn't lyse them either.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage (from strain K) has a higher ability to survive without interfering, whereas the other type of phage (from strain B) interferes more. This could be due to interference caused by the presence of another phage. So the two mutations are linked in such a way that when both are present, the interaction between them affects their functions.\n\nIn terms of recombination, if the two mutations are in different regions, like T4 and T6, there might be no recombination. Recombination typically occurs within a single phage copy number, but since the phages are different mutants, they might be in separate regions. However, the question seems to focus on the T4 genome.\n\nWait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T4 genome. If both mutations are in the same phage, recombination wouldn't make sense, but if they're in different phages, perhaps recombination occurs when the phages interact. Alternatively, recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during DNA replication.\n\nGiven that the experiment involves multiple plating and observation of colonies, the key point is that the presence of both mutant phages reduces the number of colonies. This indicates that the two phages interfere with each other's replication, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms or direct competition for resources.\n\nRecombination in this context would relate to how often the two mutations are inherited together. If they don't recombine, their frequencies would be independent. If they do recombine, certain alleles would be passed together more frequently.\n\nLooking at the data: the initial test on strain B showed that half the bacteria were lysis and half weren't. When both types are present, half are lysis, and the other half are unlysed. On strain B, only four colonies appeared, which is much lower than expected (assuming normal conditions), indicating that the unlysed cells died due to the presence of the lysogenic phage, possibly causing interference. Similarly, on strain K, four colonies appeared, also low.\n\nSo the presence of both mutant phages reduces the number of colonies, suggesting that their effects interfere. Now, what does this imply about their relationship?\n\nIf the mutations are in different regions of the phage (like T4 and T6), they might not influence each other directly unless there's an interaction mechanism. Recombination would occur when the phages interleave their genes during replication, but if they're in different regions, recombination would still occur, just not affecting each other's expression.\n\nHowever, the question is about the amount of recombination. The options are percentages, ranging from 0.02% up to 5%. To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate how many times the two mutations occurred together versus independently.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's simpler. The presence of both mutants reduces the number of colonies, suggesting that their functions interfere. If the two mutations are in the same phage, recombination wouldn't matter; it would just affect whether the phage integrates or transposes. But if they're in different phages, recombination could lead to more efficient use of resources or more successful transmission.\n\nAlternatively, the observed reduction in colonies suggests that the two mutants are acting against each other, perhaps in a way that their combined activity is less effective. If recombination allows for more efficient transfer of one mutation to the host, it could enhance this interference.\n\nBut to determine the exact percentage, I might need to look at how often the two mutations occurred together versus independently. However, with the given data, it's challenging to compute the exact percentage.

If the RF is high, you'd expect more double recombinants. Let me calculate the expected number of double recombinants using the formula: expected = total * RF^2.\n\nIf four are found on B, and 40 on K, then maybe the ratio is 1:10.

So, if R is the recombination frequency, the number of double recombinants would be proportional to R^2.

But given that, if R is 0.05 (0.05^2=0.0025), then expected would be 0.25 per four plasmids, which isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, another approach: if the expected number of double recombinants is (R^2)/4, then R^2 = (expected *4). Given that, let's say expected is 4/44 \u22480.091. So R^2 \u22480.091*4\u22480.364, so R\u2248sqrt(0.364)=~0.603. But that's higher than any option provided. Alternatively, maybe the expected is 40/44 \u22480.91, so R^2\u22480.91*4\u22483.64, R\u22481.908, still too high.\n\nThis suggests my initial assumption about the relationship between observed and expected might be incorrect. Perhaps instead, the observed number relates directly to the recombination frequency. For instance, if RF is x%, then the fraction of double recombinants is x^2/4. But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options are percentages, and considering the observed counts are 4 and 40, which is roughly 1:10 ratio. To find the RF, perhaps it's the square root of the ratio of double recombinants to the total. Since 40 is much larger than 4, maybe the RF is such that R^2 corresponds to (40-4)/something. Alternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated as (number of double recombinants)/(total possible). But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe looking up the formula helps. The number of double recombinants is approximately (R/2)^2 * N, where N is the population size.

Alternatively, maybe the expected is 40/44 \u22480.91, so R^2\u22480.91*4\u22483.64, R\u22481.908, still too high.\n\nThis suggests my initial assumption about the relationship between observed and expected might be incorrect. Perhaps instead, the observed number relates directly to the recombination frequency. For instance, if RF is x%, then the fraction of double recombinants is x^2/4. But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options are percentages, and considering the observed counts are 4 and 40, which is roughly 1:10 ratio. To find the RF, perhaps it's the square root of the ratio of double recombinants to the total. Since 40 is much larger than 4, maybe the RF is such that R^2 corresponds to (40-4)/something. Alternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated as (number of double recombinants)/(total possible). But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe looking up the formula helps. The number of double recombinants is approximately (R/2)^2 * N, where N is the population size. But again, without exact data, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is C.1.5 percent, as it falls within the range of typical recombination frequencies in phages.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Then these plates are used on different strains: the first on strain B and the second on strain K. \n\nThe results show four plumes on strain K and 40 on strain B. I remember from my notes that if two mutations cause independent effects, we'd expect some interference or undercounting because cells might die before producing enough offspring. The number of plumes depends on whether the mutations interact. If they're linked, meaning they affect the same gene (recombination), then you'll see more than expected.\n\nWait, let's think about the dilution factors. When the concentration is too high, cells might lyse too much, leading to fewer viable offspring. So a higher dilution factor (like 1e7) would lead to fewer plumes, while lower dilution (1e5) allows more plumes. The fact that one group has more plumes suggests that the higher concentration leads to fewer events, implying independence. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nRecombination frequency is often measured using the formula r = ln(N/100)/N, where N is the number of recombinant offspring. Alternatively, the coefficient of coincidence C is calculated as C = (number of observed double recombinants)/(expected double recombinants). Since the results didn't show many plumes, there must be some interference.\n\nIn the experiment, each plate has two halves. The half with more plumes (diluted 1:1e7) should have fewer successful offspring, and the less concentrated half (1:1e5) should have more. The difference in plume counts could indicate that the two mutations are linked because they interfere with each other.\n\nLet me calculate the expected number of plumes for each group assuming no interference (complete dissociation). For the 1:1e7 dilution, the expectation would be around \u221a(1e5 / 1e7) * total, which is sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 per unit. For the 1:1e5 dilution, it's \u221a(1e7 / 1e5) * total, which is sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 per unit. But since the actual numbers are 40 and 4, it's way beyond what would happen without interference.\n\nSo, the presence of significantly fewer plumes in the higher dilution suggests that the two mutations are linked. Now, to find the recombination frequency. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence is C = (observed / expected)^2. Here, expected for complete dissociation would be 40 * 4 = 1600, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the observed number is 40 in one group and 4 in another. The correct approach is to use the formula:\n\nC = (number of double recombinants)/(expected number)\n\nBut here, the expected number is zero if the mutations are linked because they interfere. However, since the data shows significant interference, C would be low. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the number of recombinants:\n\nNumber of recombinants = 2 * \u221a(p*q*(1-p)(1-q)), where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. But I don't know p and q yet.\n\nAlternatively, considering the plume counts, if the two mutations are linked, the number of double recombinants would be zero because they don't occur independently. But the observed number of plumes is 40 vs. 4, suggesting that the two mutations are linked because their effects are interfering.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the ratio of plume counts. The higher dilution (1:1e7) has 40 plumes, and the lower (1:1e5) has 4. The ratio is 10 times higher. This suggests that the two mutations interfere because the higher dilution is producing more events due to reduced viability.\n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, I think the formula involves calculating the probability of recombination based on the number of double recombinants. But since the problem states that the recombination is happening between the two mutations, we can infer that the recombinant plumes are those that have crossed over correctly.\n\nGiven that the higher dilution produces more plumes, it implies that the two mutations are linked because they cause interference. To estimate the recombination frequency, I recall that the formula is r = ln(C)/C, where C is the coefficient of coincidence. But earlier, I thought that without interference, C=1, but here, C is less than 1 because of interference.\n\nWait, actually, I think the correct approach is to calculate the expected number of double recombinants. The expected number would be proportional to the square root of the product of the concentrations. So for the higher dilution, the expected would be \u221a((1/1e7)*(1/1e5)) = \u221a(1e-12) = 1e-6. Similarly, for the lower dilution, it's \u221a((1/1e5)*(1/1e7)) = same as above. But this seems off because the observed plumes are much higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of plumes as proportional to the fraction of cells that successfully underwent recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the fraction should decrease because recombination is prevented. The observed number of plumes suggests that the recombination frequency is such that fewer cells undergo recombination compared to independent cases.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try to look at the numbers again. In the 1:1e7 dilution, there are 40 plumes. In the 1:1e5 dilution, there are 4 plumes. The ratio of plumes is 10 times higher. This suggests that the higher dilution leads to more plumes because cells may lyse more, reducing the chance of recombination. Therefore, the recombination is occurring between the two mutations.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, I think I need to use the formula involving the number of recombinant plumes. The formula for the number of recombinant plumes is 2 * \u221a(p*q*(1-p)(1-q)). But without knowing p and q, it's tricky. However, since the problem gives specific counts, perhaps I can approximate.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of recombinants in a certain dilution can be estimated. But given the data, the ratio of plumes suggests that the recombination frequency is quite high because the higher dilution shows more plumes, indicating that the two mutations interfere.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers are percentages like 0.1%, 0.2%, etc. Given that the effect is strong, I suspect that the recombination frequency is relatively high, possibly around 2% or so.\n\nWait, another approach: the coefficient of coincidence C is the ratio of observed double recombinants to the expected. If the two mutations are linked, C=0 because recombination is prevented. But in reality, we observe some interference, so C is very low.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact number of double recombinants, it's hard to compute C directly. Maybe I should instead use the formula for the number of plumes. Each plume corresponds to a single recombination event. The higher dilution has 40 plumes, which means 40 recombinant events occurred in that sample. The lower dilution has 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the reciprocal of the dilution factor, because as dilution increases, the chance of recombination decreases. So, if the higher dilution has 1/1e7 and produces 40 plumes, and the lower has 1/1e5 and produces 4 plumes, the ratio of plumes squared is (40/4)^2 = 10^2 = 100. That matches the ratio of dilution factors: (1e7 / 1e5) = 100. So, this supports the idea that the number of plumes is inversely related to the dilution factor, scaled by the square.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is likely high, but how high? Let's think about the possible values. If the recombination frequency is 0.2%, that's a very low frequency, which would mean that most cells do not recombine. But in our case, the higher dilution shows more plumes, suggesting that recombination is happening. Conversely, a lower recombination frequency would mean fewer plumes, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. If the recombination frequency is high, say 2%, then the number of plumes should increase. From the data, the higher dilution has 40 plumes, which is much higher than the expected for a 2% frequency. The lower dilution has 4 plumes, which is consistent with a moderate recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the number of plumes:\n\nNumber of plumes = (2 * \u221a(p*q)) / (1 - p - q + 2pq)\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's difficult. However, given that the higher dilution has much more plumes, it suggests that the recombination frequency is high. Among the options, 0.2% is the smallest, so that's unlikely because higher dilutions would have more plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the relationship between the number of plumes and the recombination frequency. The formula for the number of plumes N is approximately N = (2 * \u221a(f)) / f, where f is the recombination frequency (as a decimal). Solving for f, we get f \u2248 (\u221a(2N))^2, but I'm not sure if this is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the higher dilution shows 40 plumes, and the lower shows 4. The ratio of plumes is 10, which suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the expected number is much lower. Using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, C = (observed / expected)^2. If the observed number of double recombinants is zero (since they interfere), then C is zero. But in reality, there are some plumes, just fewer in the higher dilution.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should recall that in such experiments, the recombination frequency is determined by comparing the number of plumes in different dilutions. The key is that when two mutations interfere, the number of plumes increases in the higher dilution. The exact calculation requires knowledge of the probabilities p and q, but since we don't have them, we might have to make an educated guess based on the answer choices.\n\nGiven that the higher dilution shows more plumes, and the interference is significant, the recombination frequency is probably high. Looking at the options, the highest is 0.2%. However, in our case, the interference is strong, so the recombination frequency must be sufficiently high to explain why the higher dilution has more plumes. Perhaps it's around 1% or 2%.\n\nWait, I think the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nr = ln(N/100)/N,\n\nwhere N is the number of recombinant offspring. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply this here.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the fraction of cells that underwent recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the fraction would be lower. The higher dilution shows more plumes, indicating more recombination, but in our case, it's still linked because the interference is strong.\n\nHmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should pick the answer based on intuition. Strong interference (plumes increasing in higher dilution) suggests a high recombination frequency. Among the options, 0.2% is the lowest, which might not fit because higher dilutions usually indicate higher frequencies. On the other hand, 2% is plausible for significant interference.\n\nSo, tentatively, I'll choose option G, which is 0.5 percent. Wait, but that seems low. Alternatively, D is 0.1%, which is even lower. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.\n\nThe number of plumes in the higher dilution is 40, which is ten times higher than the lower dilution's 4. This indicates that recombination occurs at a rate that is affected by the dilution. The formula relating plume counts to recombination frequency might involve taking the square root of the dilution ratio.\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 10, which is (1/1e5)/(1/1e7) = 100. Taking the square root gives 10, matching the plume count ratio. This suggests that the recombination frequency is high because fewer plumes in higher dilution indicate more interference.\n\nBut how much high? If the recombination frequency were 0.2%, the expected number of plumes would be much lower. Conversely, a higher frequency would produce more plumes.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for the number of plumes:\n\nn = (2 * \u221a(f)) / f,\n\nbut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps n \u2248 \u221a(f).\n\nIf n = 40 in the higher dilution, then \u221af = 40 \u21d2 f = 1600%. That's impossible. So this approach is wrong.\n\nPerhaps another method: the number of plumes N is related to the number of recombinant alleles. The formula is N = (2 * \u221a(f)) * (total cells). But without knowing total cells, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the fraction of cells that have undergone recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the fraction should be lower because recombination is prevented.\n\nThe higher dilution has 40 plumes, which is 40% of the original population (if all cells had recombined). The lower dilution has 4 plumes, which is 4% of the population. The ratio of plumes is 10, indicating that the fraction of recombinant cells decreased by a factor of 10. This suggests that the recombination frequency is such that fewer cells have recombined.\n\nUsing the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, C = (observed / expected)^2.\n\nExpected recombinant offspring: if the mutations are independent, the expected number would be N * (f1 * f2), where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of each mutation. Assuming f1 = f2 = f, then expected = N * f^2.\n\nBut without knowing f, it's difficult. However, the observed number of plumes in the higher dilution is 40, which suggests that the recombination frequency is high. Let's assume that the expected number of plumes would be N * (f1 * f2). If f1 and f2 are both 0.05, then expected = N * 0.0025. But the observed is 40, so 40 = N * 0.0025 \u21d2 N = 16,000. That seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, if f1 = f2 = 0.02, expected = N * 0.0004 \u21d2 N = 100,000. Again, too high.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Since the higher dilution shows more plumes, it suggests that recombination is happening more frequently than expected under complete dissociation. Thus, the recombination frequency must be high.\n\nGiven the options, the highest reasonable value is 0.2% (option F). However, I'm unsure because 0.2% seems low for significant interference. Maybe 1% (option I) is closer, but none of the options go below 0.02%.\n\nWait, looking back, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. If the mutations are linked, the recombinant plumes would be few. The observed number of plumes suggests that the recombinant frequency is high, but how high?\n\nIf the recombinant frequency is 2%, then the expected number of plumes would be lower. But in our case, the higher dilution has 40 plumes, which is much higher than expected for 2%. Therefore, the recombinant frequency must be higher than 2%.\n\nSimilarly, if it's 0.2%, the expected would be lower. But our data shows higher plumes, so the frequency must be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I've been mixing up the concepts. Recombination frequency refers to the percentage of gametes that have recombined. The higher dilution having more plumes suggests more recombination, which would imply a higher recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the options, 0.2% (F) is the lowest, followed by 0.02% (J). Since we have strong evidence of interference (higher dilution plumes are higher), the recombination frequency must be high. Among the options, 0.2% is the only plausible choice, despite being the lowest.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Conversely, a higher frequency would produce more plumes.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for the number of plumes:\n\nn = (2 * \u221a(f)) / f,\n\nbut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps n \u2248 \u221a(f).\n\nIf n = 40 in the higher dilution, then \u221af = 40 \u21d2 f = 1600%. That's impossible. So this approach is wrong.\n\nPerhaps another method: the number of plumes N is related to the number of recombinant alleles. The formula is N = (2 * \u221a(f)) * (total cells). But without knowing total cells, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the fraction of cells that have undergone recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the fraction should be lower because recombination is prevented.\n\nThe higher dilution has 40 plumes, which is 40% of the original population (if all cells had recombined). The lower dilution has 4 plumes, which is 4% of the population. The ratio of plumes is 10, indicating that the fraction of recombinant cells decreased by a factor of 10. This suggests that the recombination frequency is such that fewer cells have recombined.\n\nUsing the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, C = (observed / expected)^2.\n\nExpected recombinant offspring: if the mutations are independent, the expected number would be N * (f1 * f2), where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of each mutation. Assuming f1 = f2 = f, then expected = N * f^2.\n\nBut without knowing f, it's difficult. However, the observed number of plumes in the higher dilution is 40, which suggests that the recombination frequency is high. Let's assume that the expected number of plumes would be N * (f1 * f2). If f1 and f2 are both 0.05, then expected = N * 0.0025. But the observed is 40, so 40 = N * 0.0025 \u21d2 N = 16,000. That seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, if f1 = f2 = 0.02, expected = N * 0.0004 \u21d2 N = 100,000. Again, too high.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Since the higher dilution shows more plumes, it suggests that recombination is happening more frequently than expected under complete dissociation. Thus, the recombination frequency must be high.\n\nGiven the options, the highest reasonable value is 0.2% (option F). However, I'm unsure because 0.2% seems low for significant interference. Maybe 1% (option I) is closer, but none of the options go below 0.02%.\n\nWait, looking back, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. If the mutations are linked, the recombinant plumes would be few. The observed number of plumes suggests that the recombinant frequency is high, but how high?\n\nIf the recombinant frequency is 2%, then the expected number of plumes would be lower. But in our case, the higher dilution has 40 plumes, which is much higher than expected for 2%. Therefore, the recombinant frequency must be higher than 2%.\n\nSimilarly, if it's 0.2%, the expected would be lower. But our data shows higher plumes, so the frequency must be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I've been mixing up the concepts. Recombination frequency refers to the percentage of gametes that have recombined. The higher dilution having more plumes suggests more recombination, which would imply a higher recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the options, 0.2% (F) is the lowest, followed by 0.02% (J). Since we have strong evidence of interference (higher dilution plumes are higher), the recombination frequency must be high. Among the options, 0.2% is the only plausible choice, despite being the lowest.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The key here is figuring out how the number of plumes relates to the probability of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nFirst, let me note down the details:\n- Both mutations occur in T_4 phages.\n- In an initial plate, E. coli strain B is infected by both types of mutantphages. Only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission and lyses the bacterium, causing division. The lysogenic phage might cause lysogenic fission without lysis if they're recombined.\n- After incubation, the population is halved, meaning only half survive. This implies some selection against the mutantphages.\n- Then, half of these surviving cells are plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. On this lawn, 40 plumes are found.\n- The other half are plated on strain K. Here, 4 pluses are found.\n\nWait, actually, no\u2014the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So wait, perhaps the first half was plated on strain B, resulting in 40 plumes, and the second half on strain K, giving 4 plumes. Or maybe it's the opposite? Let me clarify:\n\nThe text says: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The remaining half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K.\" Wait, no\u2014actually, it's the opposite: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The remaining half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial description is a bit confusing. It starts with a plate where the E. coli strain B is infected by both mutants. The result is a saturation divided in half. Then, half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, yielding 40 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, yielding 4 plumes.\n\nSo, each half is tested under different bacteria: half on B, half on K. Each half leads to different numbers of plumes (40 on B, 4 on K).\n\nNow, the goal is to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region. Recombination refers to the chance that two mutations occurred at different sites within the same gene locus and have swapped their positions during replication.\n\nIn phage genetics, recombination is typically measured as the percentage of time during replication when the two mutation sites are adjacent. If they were recombined, the phage would produce a recombinant offspring, otherwise, it would be parental.\n\nWhen using phage populations, especially when you're looking for double fission or other events, the number of observed double fission events can indicate the level of recombination. The more recombination, the fewer double fission events because the recombinants don't replicate independently.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with two independent mutations. The problem mentions that only the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission and lyse the cell. So the lysogenic phage must already be recombining with the wild-type phage to perform lysogenic fission.\n\nWait, but in the initial infection, both mutantphages are present, and only the lysogenic one (recombining) causes problems. So the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to perform lysogenic fission (no lytic), while the non-recombinant lysogenic phage may just replicate normally.\n\nNow, when these phages infect E. coli, if the phage carries a mutation that allows it to recombine, it will cause a different type of fission. However, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage without recombination may still replicate normally, leading to normal fission and no lytic activity.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage without recombination doesn't cause lytic fission. The lysogenic phage with recombination would cause lysogenic fission, right?\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage usually cannot undergo recombination because it's a mobile element; it doesn't have a copy of its own DNA. So if a lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to recombine with the host phage, that would lead to a recombinant phage, which would have a different genetic structure.\n\nHowever, in the given scenario, only the lysogenic phage with recombination causes issues, i.e., causes lytic fission and lyse the cell. The other lysogenic phage (without recombination) probably replicates normally, leading to normal fission without lytic activity.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage without recombination causes lytic fission and lyse the cell. That seems contradictory because lysogenic phages usually don't undergo recombination. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage with recombination can perform lysogenic fission and lyse the cell, while the non-recombined lysogenic phage may replicate normally without causing such effects.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of double fission and whether the phage's ability to recombine affects its ability to cause lytic fission or lyse the cell.\n\nIf the phage is recombined, it can either perform lysogenic fission or lysic fission depending on the specific mutation. But according to the problem, the lysogenic phage without recombination causes lytic fission and lyse the cell, whereas the lysogenic phage with recombination also causes similar behavior. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if they are recombined, they should have different characteristics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of certain behaviors, like lysocarcass formation, but in this case, it's about lytic vs. lysogenic fission.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when recombined, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that allows it to perform lysogenic fission (like having a new promoter or different replication origin), thus not causing lytic activity. Alternatively, if there's a mutation in the lysogenic phage's ability to recombine, it could affect whether it performs lysogenic or lysic fission.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. The key is to determine the number of double fission events expected in the absence of recombination versus with recombination.\n\nThe experiment involved doubling the concentration of the mutant phages before plates. For example, when half the population was plated on strain B, they were likely more fit, and vice versa. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of double fission events, assuming each plume represents a single fission event.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, all lysogenic phages would be recombined, leading to a higher rate of double fission. But in reality, in a pure population, most phages are wild-type, so the majority wouldn't cause double fission unless they're recombined.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage with recombination (which is the only one causing double fission) would have a higher chance of replicating, leading to more double fission events than expected without recombination.\n\nBut the data shows that when the mutant phages are present, the number of double fission events depends on the level of recombination. Now, the experiment measures the number of plumes, which correspond to the number of double fission events.\n\nIn the first half, when plated on strain B, 40 plumes are found. In the second half, when plated on strain K, 4 plumes are found. Assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of double fission events, we can calculate the ratio.\n\nIf the expected number of double fission events in the absence of recombination is X, and with recombination it's Y, then the observed plumes can help us infer Y/X or vice versa.\n\nLet's consider that without recombination, all the mutant phages are recombined, leading to maximum double fission. Without any recombination, all the mutant phages cause double fission, so the number of plumes would be high. With recombination, some phages are not recombined, so they don't cause double fission, reducing the number of plumes.\n\nGiven that in the first case, half the population is plated on strain B, and 40 plumes are found, which is more than what would be expected without recombination. Conversely, in the second case, half is plated on strain K, yielding only 4 plumes.\n\nWait, this doesn't quite add up. Perhaps the idea is that when recombination occurs, the phages have a certain efficiency in producing recombinant phages. The efficiency is related to the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of times the mutation has occurred across the genome.\n\nThe efficiency (e) of recombination can be calculated using the formula e = 1 - q\u00b2, where q is the recombination frequency. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the fraction of individuals that are recombinant.\n\nIn this context, when recombination occurs, the phages that are recombined will have a higher chance of causing double fission, leading to more plumes. Without recombination, only wild-type phages cause double fission, so fewer plumes.\n\nWait, but the problem describes that the lysogenic phage with recombination causes lytic fission and lyse the cell, implying that it's performing lysogenic fission. Whereas the non-recombined lysogenic phage may replicate normally, causing normal fission without lytic activity.\n\nTherefore, when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage becomes recombined, allowing it to perform lysogenic fission (without lytic activity), while the wild-type lysogenic phage continues to replicate normally.\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes would depend on the proportion of recombined phages. If the recombination frequency is high, more plumes would be expected compared to when recombination is low.\n\nBut in our experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was lower. Because if recombination occurs, the recombined phages don't cause double fission, so the number of plumes decreases. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no\u2014in this scenario, the recombined lysogenes do not cause double fission because they perform lysogenic fission, so the number of plumes would be lower than expected without recombination. But in the experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was lower than when recombination was absent.\n\nWait, let me get back to basics. Let's assume that in the absence of recombination, all the mutant phages are recombined, leading to maximum double fission. Therefore, the number of plumes (double fission events) would be highest.\n\nWith recombination, some phages are not recombined, so their fission is normal, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, if we denote P as the proportion of recombination, then the number of plumes would decrease as P increases.\n\nIn the experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was 4 instead of 40 when recombination was absent. This suggests that recombination reduces the number of plumes.\n\nAssuming that the relationship between recombination frequency and the number of plumes follows a binomial distribution, where the expected number of plumes is proportional to (1 - P), since P is the proportion of non-recombined phages.\n\nWait, perhaps the expected number of plumes without recombination is N, and with recombination it's N * (1 - P). Given that in the experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was lower than when it wasn't.\n\nFrom the data, when recombination was present, 4 plumes were found, and without recombination, 40. So the ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that recombination frequency is 10%.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 percent\n\nB. 2 percent\n\nC. 1.5 percent\n\nD. 0.1 percent\n\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nF. 0.3 percent\n\nG. 0.5 percent\n\nH. 5 percent\n\nI. 0.02 percent\n\nJ. 0.05 percent\n\nK. 0.05 percent\n\nL. 0.1 percent\n\nM. 0.1 percent\n\nN. 0.2 percent\n\nO. 0.3 percent\n\nP. 0.5 percent\n\nQ. 5 percent\n\nR. 0.02 percent\n\nS. 0.05 percent\n\nT. 0.05 percent\n\nU. 0.1 percent\n\nV. 0.1 percent\n\nW. 0.2 percent\n\nX. 0.3 percent\n\nY. 5 percent\n\nZ. 0.02 percent\n\nBut from the calculation, the recombination frequency is approximately 10%, which isn't directly listed. However, option L is 0.1 percent, and option M is 0.1 percent. Wait, but 10% is much larger than 0.1%. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the proportion of the total population that is recombined. So if 40 plumes were seen when recombination was absent and 4 when it was present, the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10, indicating that 10% of the population is recombined. However, none of the options list 10%; the closest are 0.1% and 0.2%.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misapplied the model. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of double fission events, which depends on the square of the recombination frequency. So if e is the efficiency, then e = 1 - (1 - p)^2, where p is the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, no\u2014that might complicate things further. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombinant fission events, which is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the mutation rates.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is needed. Since the number of plumes decreased by a factor of 10 when recombination occurred, the recombination frequency must be such that the number of double fission events is reduced by 10 times. Since the number of double fission events scales with the square of the recombination frequency, we can write:\n\nNumber of plumes without recombination / Number of plumes with recombination = [1] / [e^2]\n\nWhere e is the efficiency due to recombination.\n\nWait, but without knowing e, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, since the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square of the recombination frequency, and the reduction is 10x, we can set up:\n\n(40) / (4) = 10 = (1)/(e^2)\n\nWhich would imply e^2 = 0.1, so e \u2248 0.316. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the number of double fission events, which is proportional to the recombination frequency itself. So if the number of plumes without recombination is 40, and with recombination it's 4, the ratio is 10, suggesting that the recombination frequency is 10% of the population. Again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the number of plumes is not exactly equal to the number of double fission events, but rather proportional to that. So if without recombination, the number of plumes is 40, and with recombination, it's 4, the ratio is 10, meaning that the number of double fission events is reduced by a factor of 10. Since the number of double fission events is proportional to the recombination frequency, we can say that the recombination frequency is 10% of the total population.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the answer choices, which are in percentages per chromosome.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of chromosomes that are recombined. If the recombination frequency is 10%, then the percentage of chromosomes that are recombined is 10%, which isn't among the options. The closest are 0.1% and 0.2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the efficiency of recombination, which is the probability that a particular chromosome has undergone recombination. In that case, the efficiency would be 10%, but again, the options don't include 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of the genome that is recombined. However, in phage experiments, recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of the population that has recombined.\n\nGiven that, if the recombination frequency is 10%, the answer would be 10%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 0.1%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the population that has recombined, which would be 10%, but since that's not an option, I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (1 + r) / (1 - r),\n\nwhere r is the recombination frequency. But solving this gives a non-integer solution, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombinant fission events, which is proportional to the recombination frequency. Thus, if the number of plumes without recombination is 40 and with recombination is 4, the ratio is 10, indicating that the recombination frequency is 10% of the population. However, none of the options reflect 10%.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Looking back at the options, the closest is 0.1% (option D) or 0.2% (option J). Since the number of plumes is reduced by a factor of 10 when recombination occurs, and recombination frequency is often expressed as a small percentage, the answer might be 0.1%, corresponding to option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency, so:\n\nNumber of plumes without recombination / Number of plumes with recombination = (1 - e)^2,\n\nwhere e is the efficiency. Solving for e:\n\n40 / 4 = (1",

It starts with a plate where the E. coli strain B is infected by both mutants. The result is a saturation divided in half. Then, half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, yielding 40 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, yielding 4 plumes.\n\nSo, each half is tested under different bacteria: half on B, half on K. Each half leads to different numbers of plumes (40 on B, 4 on K).\n\nNow, the goal is to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region. Recombination refers to the chance that two mutations occurred at different sites within the same gene locus and have swapped their positions during replication.\n\nIn phage genetics, recombination is typically measured as the percentage of time during replication when the two mutation sites are adjacent. If they were recombined, the phage would produce a recombinant offspring, otherwise, it would be parental.\n\nWhen using phage populations, especially when you're looking for double fission or other events, the number of observed double fission events can indicate the level of recombination. The more recombination, the fewer double fission events because the recombinants don't replicate independently.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with two independent mutations. The problem mentions that only the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission and lyse the cell. So the lysogenic phage must already be recombining with the wild-type phage to perform lysogenic fission.\n\nWait, but in the initial infection, both mutantphages are present, and only the lysogenic one (recombining) causes problems. So the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to perform lysogenic fission (no lytic), while the non-recombinant lysogenic phage may just replicate normally.\n\nNow, when these phages infect E. coli, if the phage carries a mutation that allows it to recombine, it will cause a different type of fission. However, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage without recombination may still replicate normally, leading to normal fission and no lytic activity.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage without recombination doesn't cause lytic fission. The lysogenic phage with recombination would cause lysogenic fission, right?\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage usually cannot undergo recombination because it's a mobile element; it doesn't have a copy of its own DNA. So if a lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to recombine with the host phage, that would lead to a recombinant phage, which would have a different genetic structure.\n\nHowever, in the given scenario, only the lysogenic phage with recombination causes issues, i.e., causes lytic fission and lyse the cell. The other lysogenic phage (without recombination) probably replicates normally, leading to normal fission without lytic activity.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage without recombination causes lytic fission and lyse the cell. That seems contradictory because lysogenic phages usually don't undergo recombination. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage with recombination can perform lysogenic fission and lyse the cell, while the non-recombined lysogenic phage may replicate normally without causing such effects.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of double fission and whether the phage's ability to recombine affects its ability to cause lytic fission or lyse the cell.\n\nIf the phage is recombined, it can either perform lysogenic fission or lysic fission depending on the specific mutation. But according to the problem, the lysogenic phage without recombination causes lytic fission and lyse the cell, whereas the lysogenic phage with recombination also causes similar behavior. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if they are recombined, they should have different characteristics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of certain behaviors, like lysocarcass formation, but in this case, it's about lytic vs. lysogenic fission.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when recombined, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that allows it to perform lysogenic fission (like having a new promoter or different replication origin), thus not causing lytic activity. Alternatively, if there's a mutation in the lysogenic phage's ability to recombine, it could affect whether it performs lysogenic or lysic fission.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. The key is to determine the number of double fission events expected in the absence of recombination versus with recombination.\n\nThe experiment involved doubling the concentration of the mutant phages before plates. For example, when half the population was plated on strain B, they were likely more fit, and vice versa. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of double fission events, assuming each plume represents a single fission event.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, all lysogenic phages would be recombined, leading to a higher rate of double fission. But in reality, in a pure population, most phages are wild-type, so the majority wouldn't cause double fission unless they're recombined.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage with recombination (which is the only one causing double fission) would have a higher chance of replicating, leading to more double fission events than expected without recombination.\n\nBut the data shows that when the mutant phages are present, the number of double fission events depends on the level of recombination. Now, the experiment measures the number of plumes, which correspond to the number of double fission events.\n\nIn the first half, when plated on strain B, 40 plumes are found. In the second half, when plated on strain K, 4 plumes are found. Assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of double fission events, we can calculate the ratio.\n\nIf the expected number of double fission events in the absence of recombination is X, and with recombination it's Y, then the observed plumes can help us infer Y/X or vice versa.\n\nLet's consider that without recombination, all the mutant phages are recombined, leading to maximum double fission. Without any recombination, all the mutant phages cause double fission, so the number of plumes would be high. With recombination, some phages are not recombined, so they don't cause double fission, reducing the number of plumes.\n\nGiven that in the first case, half the population is plated on strain B, and 40 plumes are found, which is more than what would be expected without recombination. Conversely, in the second case, half is plated on strain K, yielding only 4 plumes.\n\nWait, this doesn't quite add up. Perhaps the idea is that when recombination occurs, the phages have a certain efficiency in producing recombinant phages. The efficiency is related to the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of times the mutation has occurred across the genome.\n\nThe efficiency (e) of recombination can be calculated using the formula e = 1 - q\u00b2, where q is the recombination frequency. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the fraction of individuals that are recombinant.\n\nIn this context, when recombination occurs, the phages that are recombined will have a higher chance of causing double fission, leading to more plumes. Without recombination, only wild-type phages cause double fission, so fewer plumes.\n\nWait, but the problem describes that the lysogenic phage with recombination causes lytic fission and lyse the cell, implying that it's performing lysogenic fission. Whereas the non-recombined lysogenic phage may replicate normally, causing normal fission without lytic activity.\n\nTherefore, when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage becomes recombined, allowing it to perform lysogenic fission (without lytic activity), while the wild-type lysogenic phage continues to replicate normally.\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes would depend on the proportion of recombined phages. If the recombination frequency is high, more plumes would be expected compared to when recombination is low.\n\nBut in our experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was lower. Because if recombination occurs, the recombined phages don't cause double fission, so the number of plumes decreases. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no\u2014in this scenario, the recombined lysogenes do not cause double fission because they perform lysogenic fission, so the number of plumes would be lower than expected without recombination. But in the experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was lower than when recombination was absent.\n\nWait, let me get back to basics. Let's assume that in the absence of recombination, all the mutant phages are recombined, leading to maximum double fission. Therefore, the number of plumes (double fission events) would be highest.\n\nWith recombination, some phages are not recombined, so their fission is normal, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, if we denote P as the proportion of recombination, then the number of plumes would decrease as P increases.\n\nIn the experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was 4 instead of 40 when recombination was absent. This suggests that recombination reduces the number of plumes.\n\nAssuming that the relationship between recombination frequency and the number of plumes follows a binomial distribution, where the expected number of plumes is proportional to (1 - P), since P is the proportion of non-recombined phages.\n\nWait, perhaps the expected number of plumes without recombination is N, and with recombination it's N * (1 - P). Given that in the experiment, when recombination was present, the number of plumes was lower than when it wasn't.\n\nFrom the data, when recombination was present, 4 plumes were found, and without recombination, 40. So the ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that recombination frequency is 10%.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 percent\n\nB. 2 percent\n\nC. 1.5 percent\n\nD. 0.1 percent\n\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nF. 0.3 percent\n\nG. 0.5 percent\n\nH. 5 percent\n\nI. 0.02 percent\n\nJ. 0.05 percent\n\nK. 0.05 percent\n\nL. 0.1 percent\n\nM. 0.1 percent\n\nN. 0.2 percent\n\nO. 0.3 percent\n\nP. 0.5 percent\n\nQ. 5 percent\n\nR. 0.02 percent\n\nS. 0.05 percent\n\nT. 0.05 percent\n\nU. 0.1 percent\n\nV. 0.1 percent\n\nW. 0.2 percent\n\nX. 0.3 percent\n\nY. 5 percent\n\nZ. 0.02 percent\n\nBut from the calculation, the recombination frequency is approximately 10%, which isn't directly listed. However, option L is 0.1 percent, and option M is 0.1 percent. Wait, but 10% is much larger than 0.1%. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the proportion of the total population that is recombined. So if 40 plumes were seen when recombination was absent and 4 when it was present, the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10, indicating that 10% of the population is recombined. However, none of the options list 10%; the closest are 0.1% and 0.2%.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misapplied the model. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of double fission events, which depends on the square of the recombination frequency. So if e is the efficiency, then e = 1 - (1 - p)^2, where p is the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, no\u2014that might complicate things further. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombinant fission events, which is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the mutation rates.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is needed. Since the number of plumes decreased by a factor of 10 when recombination occurred, the recombination frequency must be such that the number of double fission events is reduced by 10 times. Since the number of double fission events scales with the square of the recombination frequency, we can write:\n\nNumber of plumes without recombination / Number of plumes with recombination = [1] / [e^2]\n\nWhere e is the efficiency due to recombination.\n\nWait, but without knowing e, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, since the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square of the recombination frequency, and the reduction is 10x, we can set up:\n\n(40) / (4) = 10 = (1)/(e^2)\n\nWhich would imply e^2 = 0.1, so e \u2248 0.316. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the number of double fission events, which is proportional to the recombination frequency itself. So if the number of plumes without recombination is 40, and with recombination it's 4, the ratio is 10, suggesting that the recombination frequency is 10% of the population. Again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the number of plumes is not exactly equal to the number of double fission events, but rather proportional to that. So if without recombination, the number of plumes is 40, and with recombination, it's 4, the ratio is 10, meaning that the number of double fission events is reduced by a factor of 10. Since the number of double fission events is proportional to the recombination frequency, we can say that the recombination frequency is 10% of the total population.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the answer choices, which are in percentages per chromosome.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of chromosomes that are recombined. If the recombination frequency is 10%, then the percentage of chromosomes that are recombined is 10%, which isn't among the options. The closest are 0.1% and 0.2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the efficiency of recombination, which is the probability that a particular chromosome has undergone recombination. In that case, the efficiency would be 10%, but again, the options don't include 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of the genome that is recombined. However, in phage experiments, recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of the population that has recombined.\n\nGiven that, if the recombination frequency is 10%, the answer would be 10%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 0.1%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the population that has recombined, which would be 10%, but since that's not an option, I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (1 + r) / (1 - r),\n\nwhere r is the recombination frequency. But solving this gives a non-integer solution, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombinant fission events, which is proportional to the recombination frequency. Thus, if the number of plumes without recombination is 40 and with recombination is 4, the ratio is 10, indicating that the recombination frequency is 10% of the population. However, none of the options reflect 10%.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Looking back at the options, the closest is 0.1% (option D) or 0.2% (option J). Since the number of plumes is reduced by a factor of 10 when recombination occurs, and recombination frequency is often expressed as a small percentage, the answer might be 0.1%, corresponding to option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency, so:\n\nNumber of plumes without recombination / Number of plumes with recombination = (1 - e)^2,\n\nwhere e is the efficiency. Solving for e:\n\n40 / 4 = (1",

The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, yielding four more plumes.\n\nFrom what I remember, when both mutation types are present, the probability of each type being active depends on their relative strengths. Since the lysogenic phage (which is more successful) takes up less space on the lawn, it should have a higher chance of causing a division. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of cases (since four out of ten), while the wild-type phage didn't cause any divisions (since none were observed).\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is related to the number of times the two mutations interact. It's given by (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). In this case, the total number of plumes is 8 (four from each half). Out of these, only four resulted in division. So the expected recombination frequency would be 4/8 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find the percentage here. If the calculation gives 50%, that corresponds to option G, which is 0.5%. Hmm, but let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the ratio. Since the lysogenic phage was more common, maybe the formula involves the product of their frequencies. Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated as (p*q), where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. \n\nLet me think differently. If each mutation has a certain frequency, say, m and n, then the probability of both happening together is mn. But in the experiment, we're seeing how often combinations occur. However, since the presence of one mutation affects the other, the overall effect might be multiplicative. So if the lysogenic phage occurs with frequency x and the wild-type with y, the combined effect might be xy. \n\nIn our case, the lysogenic phage occurred 4 times out of 10 in one half, and the wild-type didn't occur at all in the same half. Wait, no\u2014actually, when the lysogenic phage is present, it leads to division, whereas the wild-type doesn't. So in the first half, the lysogenic phage caused division, and the wild-type didn't. In the second half, neither mutation occurred. So the total plumes would reflect whether either mutation was present.\n\nBut the key point is that the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of cases, so the combined probability is 0.9. The number of plumes indicates whether either mutation occurred. Since the lysogenic phage caused division 90% of the time, it suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the likelihood of division, implying some kind of interaction or recombination.\n\nHowever, I think the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring) / (Total Number of Offspring)\n\nHere, the number of recombinants is the number of cases where both mutations happened, leading to division. But in the experiment, only the lysogenic phage caused division, meaning that the wild-type phage did not. Therefore, there were no cases where both mutations occurred, leading to division. Thus, the recombination frequency would be zero. That contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The problem states that the lysogenic phage can cause division, while the wild-type cannot. So the number of plumes that indicate division is only due to the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the recombination frequency is zero because there was no occurrence of both mutations interacting.\n\nBut looking back, the options don't include zero. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. Maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the chance of division, so the recombination frequency relates to how much the two mutations interact. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the total number of individuals is 8 (4 + 4). The number of recombinants is the number of times both mutations occurred together, but according to the experiment, neither mutation occurred together; only the lysogenic phage caused division. Therefore, rf should be 0.\n\nBut since rf can't be zero, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, the problem might involve the concept of interference or the effect of selection. Another way to look at it is through the calculation of recombination frequency using the equation:\n\n(1 - f) = (1 - f1)(1 - f2)\n\nWhere f is the recombination frequency, and f1, f2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. Solving for f:\n\n1 - f = (1 - f1)(1 - f2)\nf = 1 - (1 - f1)(1 - f2)\n\nAssuming f1 and f2 are small, we can approximate f \u2248 f1 + f2 - f1f2. However, without knowing f1 and f2 individually, it's tricky. But from the data, the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of the cases, suggesting that f1 is high. Let's assume f1 = 0.9 and f2 = 0. Then:\n\nf = 1 - (1 - 0.9)(1 - 0) = 1 - 0.1*1 = 0.9\n\nSo the recombination frequency is 0.9, which is 90%. This seems too high compared to the answer choices. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the degree of cross-reactivity, which could relate to the percentage of the chromosome where the mutations are present.\n\nWait, another approach: the fraction of the population where both mutations occur is equal to the product of their frequencies. So, if the lysogenic phage occurs with a frequency of m and the wild-type with n, then the recombination frequency would be m*n. From the experiment, the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of the cases, indicating that its frequency is high. Assuming the wild-type phage didn't cause division at all, n=0, making rf=0. Again, conflicting with the answer choices.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plumes. Each half is dilute enough to allow individual colonies to form, but the presence of multiple mutants complicates things. Since the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of the cases, the wild-type didn't, the recombination frequency is actually the frequency of the combination of both mutations leading to division. But in reality, only the lysogenic phage did that, so the recombination frequency is zero because the wild-type phage didn't contribute to division.\n\nThis is confusing because none of the answer choices match zero. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome. If both mutations occurred together, that would be recombination. But in this case, the lysogenic phage caused division alone, so the wild-type phage didn't. Hence, there was no recombination. Therefore, the recombination frequency is zero, which isn't an option. Perhaps the question is asking for the degree of interaction rather than the actual frequency, but I'm still unsure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the percentage of the genome where both mutations are present. If the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of the cases, and the wild-type didn't, perhaps the recombination frequency is 90%. But again, that's not among the options.\n\nAnother angle: considering the experiment, the probability of the lysogenic phage causing division is 90%, and the wild-type is 0. So the expected frequency of both mutations together is zero. Therefore, the recombination frequency is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 0.5%, assuming some approximation.\n\nLooking back, the initial assumption might be incorrect. Maybe the experiment showed that the lysogenic phage had a higher chance of causing division, implying some interaction. Using the formula rf = 1 - (1 - f1)(1 - f2). If f1 = 0.9 and f2 = 0, then rf = 0.9. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula rf = f1 * f2 / (1 - f1). Not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is 0.5%, which is option G. This might be a simplification, assuming that the recombination frequency is directly proportional to the probability of each mutation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli is divided into two equal parts. One part is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in four plumes. The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, yielding four more plumes.\n\nFrom what I remember, when both mutation types are present, the probability of each type being active depends on their relative strengths. Since the lysogenic phage (which is more successful) takes up less space on the lawn, it should have a higher chance of causing a division. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of cases (since four out of ten), while the wild-type phage didn't cause any divisions (since none were observed).\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is related to the number of times the two mutations interact. It's given by (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). In this case, the total number of plumes is 8 (four from each half). Out of these, only four resulted in division. So the expected recombination frequency would be 4/8 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find the percentage here. If the calculation gives 50%, that corresponds to option G, which is 0.5%. Hmm, but let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the ratio. Since the lysogenic phage was more common, maybe the formula involves the product of their frequencies. Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated as (p*q), where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. \n\nLet me think differently. If each mutation has a certain frequency, say, m and n, then the probability of both happening together is mn. But in the experiment, we're seeing how often combinations occur. However, since the presence of one mutation affects the other, the overall effect might be multiplicative. So if the lysogenic phage occurs with frequency x and the wild-type with y, the combined effect might be xy. \n\nIn our case, the lysogenic phage occurred 4 times out of 10 in one half, and the wild-type didn't occur at all in the same half. Wait, no\u2014actually, when the lysogenic phage is present, it leads to division, whereas the wild-type doesn't. So in the first half, the lysogenic phage caused division, and the wild-type didn't. In the second half, neither mutation occurred. So the total plumes would reflect whether either mutation was present.\n\nBut the key point is that the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of cases, so the combined probability is 0.9. The number of plumes indicates whether either mutation occurred. Since the lysogenic phage caused division 90% of the time, it suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the likelihood of division, implying some kind of interaction or recombination.\n\nHowever, I think the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring) / (Total Number of Offspring)\n\nHere, the number of recombinants is the number of cases where both mutations happened, leading to division. But in the experiment, only the lysogenic phage caused division, meaning that the wild-type phage did not. Therefore, there were no cases where both mutations occurred, leading to division. Thus, the recombination frequency would be zero. That contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The problem states that the lysogenic phage can cause division, while the wild-type cannot. So the number of plumes that indicate division is only due to the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the recombination frequency is zero because there was no occurrence of both mutations interacting.\n\nBut looking back, the options don't include zero. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. Maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the chance of division, so the recombination frequency relates to how much the two mutations interact. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the total number of individuals is 8 (4 + 4). The number of recombinants is the number of times both mutations occurred together, but according to the experiment, neither mutation occurred together; only the lysogenic phage caused division. Therefore, rf should be 0.\n\nBut since rf can't be zero, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, the problem might involve the concept of interference or the effect of selection. Another way to look at it is through the calculation of recombination frequency using the equation:\n\n(1 - f) = (1 - f1)(1 - f2)\n\nWhere f is the recombination frequency, and f1, f2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. Solving for f:\n\n1 - f = (1 - f1)(1 - f2)\nf = 1 - (1 - f1)(1 - f2)\n\nAssuming f1 and f2 are small, we can approximate f \u2248 f1 + f2 - f1f2. However, without knowing f1 and f2 individually, it's tricky. But from the data, the lysogenic phage caused division in 90% of the cases, suggesting that f1 is high. Let's assume f1 = 0.9 and f2 = 0. Then:\n\nf = 1 - (1 - 0.9)(1 - 0) = 1 - 0.1*1 = 0.9\n\nSo the recombination frequency is 0.9, which is 90%. This seems too high compared to the answer choices. Maybe I'm missing something.

That probably means four successful infections. Then, the second half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, where four pluses are found as well.\n\nNow, I remember that for recombinant elements, especially in phages, there's a formula related to the number of offspring. The formula is:\n\nNumber of recombinants = (number of recombinant plasmid copies \u00d7 selection coefficient) / (number of parental plasmids + number of recombinant plasmids)\n\nIn this case, since we're dealing with two phages, let's denote R as the number of recombinant plasmids and P as the total non-recombinant plasmids (both parentals here).\n\nWait, actually, the formula might be different. Maybe it's about the ratio of recombinant to non-combinant offspring. Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated using the probability of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that if the two mutations are linked, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on their proximity. However, without knowing the map distance, maybe I should use the observed numbers to infer the likelihood.\n\nBut wait, more accurately, the formula for the number of recombinants when you have two independent genes is given by:\n\nRecomb plasmids = (number of plasmids from each type) \u00d7 (selection coefficient) / (total plasmids + selection coefficient)\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you have a recombination experiment, the number of recombinant offspring is equal to the product of the number of plasmids from each source multiplied by the probability of crossing over.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each bacterium has a certain number of plasmid copies. If the phages are in a double copy, each bacterium will have two plasmids. So, in the first dilution (1:10^7), the number of plasmids per bacterium is 2 * 10^7. Similarly, in the second dilution, it's 2 * 10^5.\n\nWhen you plate these on the host, the number of plasmids transferred depends on how many times the phage integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Since the original phages cause different behaviors, some bacteria will die (lytic fission) and others will survive (lysogenic fission).\n\nIn the first half, 4 plasmids lead to a positive result on strain B. Wait, no\u2014actually, the setup says that in the first half, four plasmids result in a positive test (since the lysogenic phage caused division). Similarly, in the second half, four plasmids result in a positive test on strain K.\n\nSo, in each dilution, the number of plasmids that successfully transfer is proportional to the number of viable offspring. For example, in the first dilution, each bacterium had 2 * 10^7 plasmids. The number of plasmids that made it to the surface is such that 4 plasmids led to a positive result on strain B. Wait, no\u2014the test is done by plating on the respective strains. So, in the first half, which was plated on strain B, four plasmids resulted in a positive test. This implies that those four plasmids were able to integrate into the chromosome, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and divide.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, which was plated on strain K, four plasmids resulted in a positive test. These plasmids must have been able to integrate into the chromosome, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and divide.\n\nSo, in both cases, the number of plasmids that successfully integrated is four. Now, to relate this to recombination, we need to know the initial proportion of plasmid copies before integration. Normally, phages come in pairs\u2014so each bacterium starts with two plasmids. One is wildtype, and one is mutated. After integration, one becomes a recombinant phage (hybrid) and the other remains wildtype or the other mutation.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, then only a fraction of the phage copies will be recombinant. Specifically, the probability of recombination is the chance that the two mutations are separated on the chromosome, so that during integration, one comes from one parent and the other from another.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the fraction of recombinant phage copies is 'f'. Then, the number of recombinant plasmids would be N * f, where N is the total number of plasmids per bacterium.\n\nFrom the first dilution (1:10^7):\n\nTotal plasmids per bacterium = 2 * 10^7\nNumber of plasmids that made it to surface = 4\nSo, f = (4)/(2*10^7) = 2e-7\n\nFrom the second dilution (1:10^5):\n\nTotal plasmids per bacterium = 2 * 10^5\nNumber of plasmids that made it to surface = 4\nSo, f = (4)/(2*10^5) = 2e-5\n\nHmm, but wait, the same 'f' should apply across all experiments if the linkage is consistent. But in reality, the mapping distance affects the frequency of recombination. If the map distance is d (in cM), then the recombination frequency is approximately d/100.\n\nBut in our case, we don't have the map distance; instead, we have the number of plasmids that made it to the surface in two different dilutions.\n\nAssuming that the same fraction f applies to both dilutions, then we can set up equations:\n\nFrom first dilution:\nf = 4 / (2e7) = 2e-7\n\nFrom second dilution:\nf = 4 / (2e5) = 2e-5\n\nBut clearly, these values are inconsistent unless f varies, which contradicts the assumption of a single locus scenario. Therefore, my initial assumption may be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids that make it to the surface is proportional to the selection coefficients. Wait, no. Another approach: the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be the product of the probabilities of each gene causing recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the formula for the number of recombinant offspring.\n\nRecombinant plasmid copies = (R * S) / (P + R)\n\nWhere R is the recombination rate (probability of recombination), S is the selection coefficient against recombination, and P is the probability of passing a recombinant copy to the daughter.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that in the presence of recombination, the number of recombinant plasmids increases.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that the number of recombinant plasmids is determined by the initial number of plasmid copies and the probability of recombination.\n\nGiven that, the expected number of recombinant plasmids in the first dilution (N1=2e7) would be N1 * f = 4 \u2192 f = 4/(2e7) = 2e-7\n\nIn the second dilution (N2=2e5), the expected number would be N2 * f = 2e5 * 2e-7 = 0.04\n\nBut in the actual experiment, we got 4 plasmids in the second dilution, meaning 4 recombinant plasmids, but according to the formula, it should be 0.04. That suggests inconsistency, implying that either the recombination rate isn't uniform or the calculations are off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is applied differently. Maybe the number of plasmids that successfully became part of the chromosome is proportional to the selection coefficient.\n\nWait, another thought: the number of recombinant plasmids in the first dilution is 4, and in the second dilution, it's also 4. Since the second dilution is a lower concentration, the same number of plasmids could represent a higher proportion of the total population. Therefore, the recombination rate must compensate for this difference.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet f be the recombination frequency (proportion of recombinant plasmid copies).\n\nIn the first dilution (N1=2e7):\n\nExpected recombinant plasmids = N1 * f = 4 \u2192 f = 4 / (2e7) = 2e-7\n\nIn the second dilution (N2=2e5):\n\nExpected recombinant plasmids = N2 * f = 2e5 * 2e-7 = 0.04\n\nBut in reality, we saw 4 plasmids, which seems way too high compared to the expectation. Hmm, that suggests that either the calculation is incorrect or the assumptions are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the number represents. It's possible that the number of plasmids that successfully integrated is 4 in both cases, but scaled by the dilution factor. Alternatively, the number of plasmids that survived the selection pressure is 4, but in the first dilution, the survival rate is higher due to the higher dilution.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmids that made it to the surface between the two dilutions. The first dilution had a much higher concentration, so fewer plasmids made it to the surface compared to the second dilution.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet R be the recombination frequency (as a fraction).\n\nLet p be the initial proportion of recombinant plasmids (before any integration).\n\nThen, after integration, the distribution of recombinant plasmids would follow a Mendelian pattern: p*(1 - R) wildtype, p*(1 - R) wildtype, p*R hybrid, p*R hybrid.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, after integration, the distribution would be (p)^2 wildtype homozygotes, 2*p*(1 - p) heterozygotes, and (1 - p)^2 hybrid homozygotes.\n\nBut in our case, the phages are diploid, so each bacterium has two copies. Assuming that the two mutations are linked, only a fraction R will be recombinant.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of plasmids per bacterium after integration would be:\n\nWildtype: 2*(1 - R)\nHybrid: 2*R\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not exactly accurate. Because each bacterium has two copies, and each copy can be wildtype or hybrid. So, the total number of plasmids per bacterium would be 2*(1 - R) for wildtype and 2*R for hybrids.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each bacterium started with two plasmid copies. During integration, each copy has a certain probability of becoming a recombinant copy.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of wildtype plasmids per bacterium is 2*(1 - R)\nThe expected number of hybrid plasmids per bacterium is 2*R\n\nNow, when we plate the phage at different concentrations, the number of plasmids that make it to the surface is proportional to the selection pressure.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the selection pressure is very low, so the majority of phages remain inside the cell. The number of plasmids that reach the surface is 4. So, the proportion of plasmids reaching the surface is 4/(2e7) = 2e-7.\n\nThis proportion corresponds to the probability that a plasmid copy was integrated, which is (1 - R). Therefore:\n\n(1 - R) = 2e-7 \u2192 R = 1 - 2e-7 \u2248 0.9999998, which is almost complete linkage, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, but that would mean that most of the phages have integrated, which aligns with the high dilution (1:10^7). However, in the second dilution (1:10^5), we still get 4 plasmids, which would correspond to a higher probability of integration. Let's check:\n\nIn the second dilution, the proportion of plasmids reaching the surface is 4/(2e5) = 2e-5.\n\nAgain, this equals (1 - R), so:\n\n(1 - R) = 2e-5 \u2192 R = 1 - 2e-5 \u2248 0.99998, which is extremely close to a perfect linkage. But this seems contradictory because in the first dilution, we already had nearly all integration.\n\nThis suggests that either my reasoning is flawed or the data indicates a very tight linkage, which isn't among the options provided. The closest option is F (0.3%) which is 0.003.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made an error in assuming that the number of plasmids directly relates to the recombination frequency. Alternatively, maybe the number of plasmids that integrate is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor. For instance, sqrt(10^7) vs sqrt(10^5). But I'm not confident about that approach.\n\nAnother angle: the number of recombinant plasmids detected should be proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. But without specific selection coefficients, this might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that in the first dilution, we see 4 plasmids, and in the second, 4 plasmids. Given that the second dilution is much lower, the same number of plasmids implies a higher recombination rate. Let me try to find R such that:\n\nIn the first dilution: 4 = 2e7 * R\n\u2192 R = 4/(2e7) = 2e-7\n\nIn the second dilution: 4 = 2e5 * R\n\u2192 R = 4/(2e5) = 2e-5\n\nBut this gives two different R values, which is impossible unless R varies, which it shouldn't. Therefore, this suggests that the data cannot be explained under a simple linkage model, implying that there might be other factors at play, such as interference or different selection pressures. However, given the limited information, I'll proceed under the assumption that the data suggests a high degree of linkage.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would be near 100%, but looking at the answer choices, the highest is G (0.5%), followed by H (0.02%). None of them are near 100%. So perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids is inversely related to the recombination frequency. Or maybe I should use the formula for the number of recombinant offspring.\n\nThe formula for the number of recombinants (Nc) in a diallelic system is:\n\nNc = (n * n) * [ (1 - f) - f ] \n\nWhere n is the number of parents and f is the crossover frequency. But I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the square of the number of cross-over events, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula involves the number of plasmid copies and the recombination frequency. The number of recombinant plasmids can be approximated as:\n\nR = (N1 * N2) * (1 - f) / (N1 + N2)\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the confusion and time constraints, perhaps the intended approach is simpler. Let me count the number of plasmids that successfully integrated in each dilution.\n\nIn the first dilution, 4 plasmids made it to the surface. Each bacterium had 2 plasmids initially, so 4 plasmids means 2 plasmids integrated (assuming each bacterium can only integrate once). Wait, no\u2014if each bacterium starts with two plasmids, and each integrates independently, then integrating a phage would replace one of the plasmids. So, integrating would mean replacing one plasmid with a new one.\n\nTherefore, if 4 plasmids make it to the surface, that means 4 phages integrated, replacing 4 plasmids. Since each bacterium started with 2 plasmids, integrating 4 phages would require 4 plasmids per bacterium? That doesn't make sense because each bacterium can only integrate once.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Each bacterium can integrate only once, so if 4 plasmids make it to the surface, that means 4 phages integrated, meaning 4 plasmids were replaced. But each bacterium can only integrate once, so the number of integrated plasmids is limited by the number of phages available.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps the intended solution is to calculate the number of recombinant plasmids based on the number of cells and dilutions.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of plasmids that successfully integrated is proportional to the number of cells and the dilution factor. Since the first dilution is 1:10^7, and the second is 1:10^5, the ratio of plasmid counts is 10^5 : 10^7, which is 1:100. Therefore, the recombination frequency must account for this ratio.\n\nPerhaps the recombination frequency is related to the ratio of plasmid counts between the two dilutions. If in the first dilution, we have 4 plasmids and in the second, 4 plasmids, but the second is a much lower dilution, the recombination frequency must be high enough to explain the higher number of plasmids reaching the surface in the first dilution.\n\nWait, but the number of plasmids reached the surface is the same in both dilutions (4 each), but the first dilution is much stronger. So, this suggests that the recombination frequency is very high, leading to a high number of recombinant plasmids even at lower dilutions.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest plausible recombination frequency is G (0.5%), followed by H (0.02%). Since none of the options suggest a very high frequency like 99%, perhaps the intended answer is C (1.5%).\n\nWait, but why would the recombination frequency be around 1%?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids that made it to the surface is 4 in each dilution, and the number of plasmids per bacterium is 2. So, in the first dilution, 4 plasmids out of 2e7 per bacterium. In the second, 4 plasmids out of 2e5 per bacterium.\n\nThe ratio of plasmid counts between the two dil",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two halves, each half being tested separately.\n\nThe first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. In this case, four pluses are found. That probably means four successful infections. Then, the second half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, where four pluses are found as well.\n\nNow, I remember that for recombinant elements, especially in phages, there's a formula related to the number of offspring. The formula is:\n\nNumber of recombinants = (number of recombinant plasmid copies \u00d7 selection coefficient) / (number of parental plasmids + number of recombinant plasmids)\n\nIn this case, since we're dealing with two phages, let's denote R as the number of recombinant plasmids and P as the total non-recombinant plasmids (both parentals here).\n\nWait, actually, the formula might be different. Maybe it's about the ratio of recombinant to non-combinant offspring. Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated using the probability of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that if the two mutations are linked, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on their proximity. However, without knowing the map distance, maybe I should use the observed numbers to infer the likelihood.\n\nBut wait, more accurately, the formula for the number of recombinants when you have two independent genes is given by:\n\nRecomb plasmids = (number of plasmids from each type) \u00d7 (selection coefficient) / (total plasmids + selection coefficient)\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you have a recombination experiment, the number of recombinant offspring is equal to the product of the number of plasmids from each source multiplied by the probability of crossing over.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each bacterium has a certain number of plasmid copies. If the phages are in a double copy, each bacterium will have two plasmids. So, in the first dilution (1:10^7), the number of plasmids per bacterium is 2 * 10^7. Similarly, in the second dilution, it's 2 * 10^5.\n\nWhen you plate these on the host, the number of plasmids transferred depends on how many times the phage integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Since the original phages cause different behaviors, some bacteria will die (lytic fission) and others will survive (lysogenic fission).\n\nIn the first half, 4 plasmids lead to a positive result on strain B. Wait, no\u2014actually, the setup says that in the first half, four plasmids result in a positive test (since the lysogenic phage caused division). Similarly, in the second half, four plasmids result in a positive test on strain K.\n\nSo, in each dilution, the number of plasmids that successfully transfer is proportional to the number of viable offspring. For example, in the first dilution, each bacterium had 2 * 10^7 plasmids. The number of plasmids that made it to the surface is such that 4 plasmids led to a positive result on strain B. Wait, no\u2014the test is done by plating on the respective strains. So, in the first half, which was plated on strain B, four plasmids resulted in a positive test. This implies that those four plasmids were able to integrate into the chromosome, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and divide.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, which was plated on strain K, four plasmids resulted in a positive test. These plasmids must have been able to integrate into the chromosome, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and divide.\n\nSo, in both cases, the number of plasmids that successfully integrated is four. Now, to relate this to recombination, we need to know the initial proportion of plasmid copies before integration. Normally, phages come in pairs\u2014so each bacterium starts with two plasmids. One is wildtype, and one is mutated. After integration, one becomes a recombinant phage (hybrid) and the other remains wildtype or the other mutation.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, then only a fraction of the phage copies will be recombinant. Specifically, the probability of recombination is the chance that the two mutations are separated on the chromosome, so that during integration, one comes from one parent and the other from another.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the fraction of recombinant phage copies is 'f'. Then, the number of recombinant plasmids would be N * f, where N is the total number of plasmids per bacterium.\n\nFrom the first dilution (1:10^7):\n\nTotal plasmids per bacterium = 2 * 10^7\nNumber of plasmids that made it to surface = 4\nSo, f = (4)/(2*10^7) = 2e-7\n\nFrom the second dilution (1:10^5):\n\nTotal plasmids per bacterium = 2 * 10^5\nNumber of plasmids that made it to surface = 4\nSo, f = (4)/(2*10^5) = 2e-5\n\nHmm, but wait, the same 'f' should apply across all experiments if the linkage is consistent. But in reality, the mapping distance affects the frequency of recombination. If the map distance is d (in cM), then the recombination frequency is approximately d/100.\n\nBut in our case, we don't have the map distance; instead, we have the number of plasmids that made it to the surface in two different dilutions.\n\nAssuming that the same fraction f applies to both dilutions, then we can set up equations:\n\nFrom first dilution:\nf = 4 / (2e7) = 2e-7\n\nFrom second dilution:\nf = 4 / (2e5) = 2e-5\n\nBut clearly, these values are inconsistent unless f varies, which contradicts the assumption of a single locus scenario. Therefore, my initial assumption may be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids that make it to the surface is proportional to the selection coefficients. Wait, no. Another approach: the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be the product of the probabilities of each gene causing recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the formula for the number of recombinant offspring.\n\nRecombinant plasmid copies = (R * S) / (P + R)\n\nWhere R is the recombination rate (probability of recombination), S is the selection coefficient against recombination, and P is the probability of passing a recombinant copy to the daughter.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that in the presence of recombination, the number of recombinant plasmids increases.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that the number of recombinant plasmids is determined by the initial number of plasmid copies and the probability of recombination.\n\nGiven that, the expected number of recombinant plasmids in the first dilution (N1=2e7) would be N1 * f = 4 \u2192 f = 4/(2e7) = 2e-7\n\nIn the second dilution (N2=2e5), the expected number would be N2 * f = 2e5 * 2e-7 = 0.04\n\nBut in the actual experiment, we got 4 plasmids in the second dilution, meaning 4 recombinant plasmids, but according to the formula, it should be 0.04. That suggests inconsistency, implying that either the recombination rate isn't uniform or the calculations are off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is applied differently. Maybe the number of plasmids that successfully became part of the chromosome is proportional to the selection coefficient.\n\nWait, another thought: the number of recombinant plasmids in the first dilution is 4, and in the second dilution, it's also 4. Since the second dilution is a lower concentration, the same number of plasmids could represent a higher proportion of the total population. Therefore, the recombination rate must compensate for this difference.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet f be the recombination frequency (proportion of recombinant plasmid copies).\n\nIn the first dilution (N1=2e7):\n\nExpected recombinant plasmids = N1 * f = 4 \u2192 f = 4 / (2e7) = 2e-7\n\nIn the second dilution (N2=2e5):\n\nExpected recombinant plasmids = N2 * f = 2e5 * 2e-7 = 0.04\n\nBut in reality, we saw 4 plasmids, which seems way too high compared to the expectation. Hmm, that suggests that either the calculation is incorrect or the assumptions are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the number represents. It's possible that the number of plasmids that successfully integrated is 4 in both cases, but scaled by the dilution factor. Alternatively, the number of plasmids that survived the selection pressure is 4, but in the first dilution, the survival rate is higher due to the higher dilution.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmids that made it to the surface between the two dilutions.

Actually, after integration, the distribution would be (p)^2 wildtype homozygotes, 2*p*(1 - p) heterozygotes, and (1 - p)^2 hybrid homozygotes.\n\nBut in our case, the phages are diploid, so each bacterium has two copies. Assuming that the two mutations are linked, only a fraction R will be recombinant.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of plasmids per bacterium after integration would be:\n\nWildtype: 2*(1 - R)\nHybrid: 2*R\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not exactly accurate. Because each bacterium has two copies, and each copy can be wildtype or hybrid. So, the total number of plasmids per bacterium would be 2*(1 - R) for wildtype and 2*R for hybrids.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each bacterium started with two plasmid copies. During integration, each copy has a certain probability of becoming a recombinant copy.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of wildtype plasmids per bacterium is 2*(1 - R)\nThe expected number of hybrid plasmids per bacterium is 2*R\n\nNow, when we plate the phage at different concentrations, the number of plasmids that make it to the surface is proportional to the selection pressure.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the selection pressure is very low, so the majority of phages remain inside the cell.

The other group is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, showing 4 pluses.\n\nSo the experiment shows that when both mutantphages are present, some colonies die on strain B's lawn, indicating they are resistant or somehow prevent them from causing issues there. On strain K's lawn, fewer colonies die, meaning they're more likely to cause issues there.\n\nNow, recombination refers to the point where the two mutations interact. If they don't recombine, the effects might be additive or independent. Recombination would mean the mutations affect each other at a specific site, possibly making one mutation better or worse depending on the other.\n\nThe key here is to determine how many times the two mutations occurred at the same site. Since both mutantphages are present, any recombination would lead to either no effect or an interaction.\n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of pluses on strain K (4) compared to strain B (40) suggests that when both mutants are present, their effect is less pronounced on K than on B. This implies that the regions where they recombine may have reduced the effectiveness of both mutations, perhaps due to competition for binding sites or interference.\n\nIf recombination occurs, it could reduce the number of successful combinations. Without recombination, each mutation would independently contribute to the resistance. So if there was complete recombination, all plasmids would be resistant, leading to fewer pluses on both strains. But in reality, we see that on K there are more pluses than expected without recombination, suggesting that the presence of the other mutation reduces the overall effect.\n\nWait, actually, the opposite happens. When both mutants are present, the number of pluses on K increases relative to B. That suggests that the presence of one mutation makes the other's effect less effective. For example, if recombination leads to one mutation being dominant over the other, then having both would result in even fewer pluses, but since we see more pluses on K, maybe it's the opposite\u2014when recombination occurs, the combined effect isn't as strong.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations were completely non-recombinant, each would act independently. So the probability of a plasmid being resistant would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. But in our case, it seems like the combination of both mutations isn't as effective as either alone.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are recombined, the combined effect is reduced. So the probability of a plasmid being resistant becomes lower than expected. In our data, on strain B, which is susceptible to both mutants, we saw higher pluses (40 vs. expected, say, 1% of 1e7 is 1e5, but that's not right). Wait, let's clarify:\n\nWhen both mutantphages are present, the population is split into two halves. One half is plated on strain B's lawn, and the other on strain K's lawn. The numbers of pluses indicate the likelihood of resistance.\n\nOn strain B's lawn (which is more susceptible), 40 pluses occur, which is a significant number. On strain K's lawn, only 4 pluses occur. So the presence of the second mutation (on strain K) makes the first mutation (on strain B) less effective. That suggests that the two mutations interfere at the same site, meaning they recombine. Because if they didn't recombine, the combined effect should be similar to the sum of individual effects.\n\nBut wait, if they recombine, the combined effect might be less than the sum. So when you have both mutations, the total resistance would be less than what each mutation would provide individually. Therefore, the presence of both mutations reduces the overall success rate. In our case, when both are present, the effect is less on strain B but still significant on strain K.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula related to the number of recombinants observed. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring / Total Number of Offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, the \"offspring\" refer to the plasmids that have successfully replicated and caused a split. The number of plasmids that replicate without splitting is the non-recombinant category, and those that do split are either recombinant or non-recombinant.\n\nIn our case, the total number of plasmids is the sum of plasmids on both plates. Each plate has 1e7 or 1e5 plasmids, but the exact numbers aren't given. However, the key is that the plasmids on strain B's lawn (plated on strain B) have higher plasmids because they survived the split (since they didn't lyse E. coli B).\n\nWait, no\u2014the split happened during the replication, so the plasmids that didn't split are those that were resistant. So the plasmids that split are those that became resistant because of the mutation. \n\nLet me try again:\n\n- Plate 1: Strain B, 1:1e7 dilution.\n- Plated on strain B's lawn. The plasmids that split are resistant. The ones that don't split are susceptible.\n- Result: 40 pluses on strain B's lawn.\n\n- Plate 2: Strain K, 1:1e5 dilution.\n- Plated on strain K's lawn. Similarly, plasmids that split are resistant.\n- Result: 4 pluses on strain K's lawn.\n\nTotal plasmids across both plates: Let\u2019s assume equal numbers for simplicity. If each plate had N plasmids, the total is 2N. The number of splits (resistant) would be 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nAssuming the rest didn\u2019t split: Non-splitting = 2N - 44.\n\nBut without knowing N, maybe we can relate the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on each plate depends on the dilution factor. For example, a 1:1e7 dilution means that each original plasmid has been replicated 7 times, so each original plasmid contributes 8 plasmids? Wait, no\u2014replication creates new copies, so a 1:1e7 dilution means that the plasmids are spread over 1e7 cells, so each original plasmid ends up on multiple cells, but the number of plasmids per cell is much higher. Hmm, this approach might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way: the probability of a plasmid being resistant when both mutants are present is 4/ (4+40) )= 4/44 \u2248 9%. If recombination were absent, the resistant fraction would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation acting independently. So if p1 is the probability for mutation A and p2 for mutation B, then the expected resistant fraction would be p1 * p2.\n\nFrom the experiment, when both are present, the resistance is 4/(4+40)= ~9%, which is approximately 0.09. So if recombination exists, the actual resistance is less than that. If recombination is zero, the expected resistance would be p1*p2. Let's assume that p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation in the population. However, without knowing p1 and p2, it's tricky.\n\nAnother approach: The ratio of plasmids that split on each strain gives us information about the recombination frequency. Specifically, if the number of plasmids that split on strain B is higher than those on strain K, it suggests that the mutations are interfering at the same site, implying recombination.\n\nGiven that 40 plasmids split on strain B and 4 on strain K, the ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This indicates that the mutations interfere, and thus recombination is occurring.\n\nThe recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - [(1 - F_m)^2]\n\nWhere F_m is the map distance (recombination fraction) between the two mutations. Alternatively, another formula is used when dealing with recombination rates.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward method is to consider the number of recombinant plasmids. The number of recombinant plasmids is the difference between the expected and observed. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids) / (Total Plasmids)\n\nBut in our case, the plasmids that split are the ones that are resistant. So the number of recombinant plasmids is 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. The total plasmids are the sum of those that split on each plate plus those that didn't split. However, without knowing the total, it's hard to apply directly.\n\nAn alternative method is to realize that when there is recombination, the combined effect is less than the sum of individual effects. So the observed resistance (44 plasmids) is less than expected if the effects were additive.\n\nIf the mutations were non-recombining, the resistance would be p1 + p2 - p1*p2. Here, p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation causing resistance. From the experiment, when both are present, the probability is 44/N, where N is the total number of plasmids. But without knowing N, we can't compute it directly.\n\nHowever, the fact that the number of plasmids that split on strain B is much higher than on strain K suggests that the mutations interfere, which implies recombination. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of plasmids that split on each strain. Since the ratio is 10:1, this indicates that the mutations are interfering, so recombination must be occurring.\n\nThe recombination frequency can also be approximated by the ratio of plasmids that split on one strain compared to the total plasmids. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plasmids that split on each strain relates to the number of recombinants. The number of recombinant plasmids is the difference between the expected and observed. So if the expected under independence would be p1 + p2 - p1*p2, and the observed is 44/N.\n\nBut without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps we can make an assumption. Since the problem asks for the percentage of recombination, and the options are small percentages, it suggests that recombination is happening in a controlled area.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, then 2%, etc. Given the ratio of 10:1, which suggests that the mutations interfere significantly, probably recombination is around 1% to 2%.\n\nWait, I remember a formula where the recombination frequency can be estimated as:\n\nRecombination Frequency = [ (R_B) / (R_B + R_K) ] \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere R_B is the number of plasmids that split on strain B, and R_K on strain K.\n\nSo R_B is 40, R_K is 4. So 40/(40+4) = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which is about 90.9%. That doesn't seem right because recombination frequency can't exceed 100%, but the formula might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, another formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (R_B \u00d7 R_K) / (R_B + R_K)\n\nWhich would be (40\u00d74)/(40+4) = 160/44 \u2248 3.64%. That's too low.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm mixing up formulas. Perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the ratio of plasmids that split on each strain indicates the interference, and the recombination frequency can be approximated by (R_B - R_K)/R_B.\n\nSo (40 -4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9, which is 90%. Again, that seems off.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently. The probability that a plasmid splits on strain B is 40/(40+4)= 40/44\u22480.909, and on strain K, it's 4/44\u22480.091. If these probabilities multiply (p1*p2), that would give the expected number of resistant plasmids. But without knowing p1 and p2, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - [(1 - F_m)^2]\n\nWhere F_m is the map distance, which equals the proportion of recombinant offspring. But again, without knowing F_m, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The number of recombinant plasmids is 44. Assuming that these correspond to the number of recombinants, then the recombination frequency would be (number of recombinants) / (total plasmids). But I'm not certain.\n\nGiven the options, and the fact that the ratio is about 10:1, which suggests that the mutations interfere significantly, the most plausible answer is C. 1.5 percent.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. If the recombination frequency is 1.5%, then the expected number of recombinants would be 1.5% of the total plasmids. If the total plasmids are 44, then 0.015*44\u22480.66, which rounds to 1. That matches the observed 4 plasmids on K, which is higher. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1%, leading to 0.01*44\u22480.44, which is 0, but the observed is 4, which is much higher. So that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the map distance. The map distance between the two mutations is the proportion of the chromosome that they occupy. If the mutations are recombined, the map distance decreases.\n\nBut without knowing the actual map distance, it's difficult. Alternatively, the ratio of plasmids that split on each strain can help. The ratio is 10:1, which suggests that the mutations interfere, so recombination is occurring.\n\nGiven that, and looking at the answer options, 1.5% seems reasonable because 10:1 is quite high interference, requiring moderate recombination frequencies.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option C. 1.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divide equally into two groups. One group is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 pluses, which means each has a high chance of lysing. The other group is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, showing 4 pluses.\n\nSo the experiment shows that when both mutantphages are present, some colonies die on strain B's lawn, indicating they are resistant or somehow prevent them from causing issues there. On strain K's lawn, fewer colonies die, meaning they're more likely to cause issues there.\n\nNow, recombination refers to the point where the two mutations interact. If they don't recombine, the effects might be additive or independent. Recombination would mean the mutations affect each other at a specific site, possibly making one mutation better or worse depending on the other.\n\nThe key here is to determine how many times the two mutations occurred at the same site. Since both mutantphages are present, any recombination would lead to either no effect or an interaction.\n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of pluses on strain K (4) compared to strain B (40) suggests that when both mutants are present, their effect is less pronounced on K than on B. This implies that the regions where they recombine may have reduced the effectiveness of both mutations, perhaps due to competition for binding sites or interference.\n\nIf recombination occurs, it could reduce the number of successful combinations. Without recombination, each mutation would independently contribute to the resistance. So if there was complete recombination, all plasmids would be resistant, leading to fewer pluses on both strains. But in reality, we see that on K there are more pluses than expected without recombination, suggesting that the presence of the other mutation reduces the overall effect.\n\nWait, actually, the opposite happens. When both mutants are present, the number of pluses on K increases relative to B. That suggests that the presence of one mutation makes the other's effect less effective. For example, if recombination leads to one mutation being dominant over the other, then having both would result in even fewer pluses, but since we see more pluses on K, maybe it's the opposite\u2014when recombination occurs, the combined effect isn't as strong.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations were completely non-recombinant, each would act independently. So the probability of a plasmid being resistant would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. But in our case, it seems like the combination of both mutations isn't as effective as either alone.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are recombined, the combined effect is reduced. So the probability of a plasmid being resistant becomes lower than expected. In our data, on strain B, which is susceptible to both mutants, we saw higher pluses (40 vs. expected, say, 1% of 1e7 is 1e5, but that's not right). Wait, let's clarify:\n\nWhen both mutantphages are present, the population is split into two halves. One half is plated on strain B's lawn, and the other on strain K's lawn. The numbers of pluses indicate the likelihood of resistance.\n\nOn strain B's lawn (which is more susceptible), 40 pluses occur, which is a significant number. On strain K's lawn, only 4 pluses occur. So the presence of the second mutation (on strain K) makes the first mutation (on strain B) less effective. That suggests that the two mutations interfere at the same site, meaning they recombine. Because if they didn't recombine, the combined effect should be similar to the sum of individual effects.\n\nBut wait, if they recombine, the combined effect might be less than the sum. So when you have both mutations, the total resistance would be less than what each mutation would provide individually. Therefore, the presence of both mutations reduces the overall success rate. In our case, when both are present, the effect is less on strain B but still significant on strain K.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula related to the number of recombinants observed. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring / Total Number of Offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, the \"offspring\" refer to the plasmids that have successfully replicated and caused a split.

Then another half is treated with 1:10^5 dilution and plated on strain K, finding four more pluses on K. So, each treatment gives some plasmid-free (lysed) and some plasmid-bearing (unlysed) colonies.\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutation sites are on the same gene or different genes. If they're on the same gene, the recombinants might have reduced activity, but since both mutants cause issues when combined, maybe they're on different genes. Recombination would reduce the chance of independent assortment, affecting the distribution of plasmids.\n\nThe expected number without any recombination would be half of each group, right? Because if they were on the same chromosome, you'd see more recombinant plasmids. Wait, actually, no\u2014without recombination, each parent gamete should contribute its original allele. So if the two mutants are on the same gene, then each offspring would get either both wild-type alleles or both mutated ones, depending on how they split during replication.\n\nBut here, we're seeing four pluses in the B group and four pluses in the K group. Each group has half the original population. So, for example, in the B group, four pluses mean that 80% of the cells had the mutated phage. Similarly, in the K group, four pluses out of 50,000 means about 0.08%. That's really low. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The total number of plasmids per colony depends on the dilution. For the first experiment, treating with 1:10^7 dilution means each culture has 1e-7 phages. Plating them on strain B would give some positive and negative results. If there's recombination, the distribution of phages would change. \n\nIf the two mutations are on the same gene, the recombinant plasmids would be less frequent because they don't assort independently. So the observed plasmid load would be higher than expected under complete linkage. But here, the observed numbers are very low\u2014only four pluses in each group. That suggests that the mutations are linked because otherwise, you'd expect more plasmids due to independent assortment.\n\nSo, the percentage of recombinants would depend on how often the two mutations are inherited together versus separately. Since only four pluses are found in each group, which is much lower than what you'd expect from independent assortment, this indicates significant recombination.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can consider the ratio of recombinant plasmids to the total possible. In the absence of recombination, all plasmids would come from the parents. With recombination, some would come from each parent. The fraction of plasmids that are recombinants would indicate the level of recombination.\n\nIn the first experiment, the number of plasmids per colony depends on the dilution. Let's say the initial concentration is C. After dilution with 1:10^7, the concentration becomes C * 1e-7. If the number of phages per bacterium is proportional to the concentration, then the number of phages per colony would be N = C * 1e-7 * N_bact. Assuming N_bact is around 1e6 (a typical value), N \u2248 C * 1e-1.\n\nPlating on strain B would yield some positive and negative colonies. The number of plasmids per colony would depend on the presence of the recombined phage. If recombination occurs frequently, the plasmid content would be lower overall.\n\nGiven that only four pluses are found in each group, the frequency of recombination must be high enough to explain such a small number. To find the exact percentage, we might use the formula:\n\nPercentage of recombinants = [ (observed - expected) / expected ] * 100%\n\nHere, expected would be the number if no recombination occurred, which would be approximately 50% of each group (since each colony could have either phage from parent 1 or parent 2). However, in reality, the expected would be less because the actual numbers are much smaller.\n\nAlternatively, considering that only four pluses exist in each group, and each group is half the population, the probability of getting a plasmid from each parent is low. This suggests that recombination is widespread, leading to a high percentage of recombinant plasmids.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the highest percentage given is 5%, but the correct answer is likely lower. Considering the low number of plasmids found, perhaps around 1% or 2%. Given the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, and H is 5%. Between these, the most plausible is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). \n\nWait, but if the number of plasmids is four in 50,000, that's a very low frequency. The expected frequency without recombination would be higher, so recombination must be high. Maybe around 2% as in option B. Alternatively, considering the dilution effect, the required percentage might be lower. \n\nAfter thinking through, I believe the correct answer is F (0.3%), as it aligns with the observed low frequency of plasmids.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into a lysed and an unlysed batch. \n\nThe first part says that when half the bacteria are treated with a 1:10^7 dilution and plated on strain B, four pluses are found. Then another half is treated with 1:10^5 dilution and plated on strain K, finding four more pluses on K. So, each treatment gives some plasmid-free (lysed) and some plasmid-bearing (unlysed) colonies.\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutation sites are on the same gene or different genes. If they're on the same gene, the recombinants might have reduced activity, but since both mutants cause issues when combined, maybe they're on different genes. Recombination would reduce the chance of independent assortment, affecting the distribution of plasmids.\n\nThe expected number without any recombination would be half of each group, right? Because if they were on the same chromosome, you'd see more recombinant plasmids. Wait, actually, no\u2014without recombination, each parent gamete should contribute its original allele. So if the two mutants are on the same gene, then each offspring would get either both wild-type alleles or both mutated ones, depending on how they split during replication.\n\nBut here, we're seeing four pluses in the B group and four pluses in the K group. Each group has half the original population. So, for example, in the B group, four pluses mean that 80% of the cells had the mutated phage. Similarly, in the K group, four pluses out of 50,000 means about 0.08%. That's really low. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The total number of plasmids per colony depends on the dilution. For the first experiment, treating with 1:10^7 dilution means each culture has 1e-7 phages. Plating them on strain B would give some positive and negative results. If there's recombination, the distribution of phages would change. \n\nIf the two mutations are on the same gene, the recombinant plasmids would be less frequent because they don't assort independently. So the observed plasmid load would be higher than expected under complete linkage. But here, the observed numbers are very low\u2014only four pluses in each group. That suggests that the mutations are linked because otherwise, you'd expect more plasmids due to independent assortment.\n\nSo, the percentage of recombinants would depend on how often the two mutations are inherited together versus separately. Since only four pluses are found in each group, which is much lower than what you'd expect from independent assortment, this indicates significant recombination.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can consider the ratio of recombinant plasmids to the total possible. In the absence of recombination, all plasmids would come from the parents. With recombination, some would come from each parent. The fraction of plasmids that are recombinants would indicate the level of recombination.\n\nIn the first experiment, the number of plasmids per colony depends on the dilution. Let's say the initial concentration is C. After dilution with 1:10^7, the concentration becomes C * 1e-7. If the number of phages per bacterium is proportional to the concentration, then the number of phages per colony would be N = C * 1e-7 * N_bact. Assuming N_bact is around 1e6 (a typical value), N \u2248 C * 1e-1.\n\nPlating on strain B would yield some positive and negative colonies. The number of plasmids per colony would depend on the presence of the recombined phage. If recombination occurs frequently, the plasmid content would be lower overall.\n\nGiven that only four pluses are found in each group, the frequency of recombination must be high enough to explain such a small number. To find the exact percentage, we might use the formula:\n\nPercentage of recombinants = [ (observed - expected) / expected ] * 100%\n\nHere, expected would be the number if no recombination occurred, which would be approximately 50% of each group (since each colony could have either phage from parent 1 or parent 2). However, in reality, the expected would be less because the actual numbers are much smaller.\n\nAlternatively, considering that only four pluses exist in each group, and each group is half the population, the probability of getting a plasmid from each parent is low. This suggests that recombination is widespread, leading to a high percentage of recombinant plasmids.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the highest percentage given is 5%, but the correct answer is likely lower. Considering the low number of plasmids found, perhaps around 1% or 2%. Given the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, and H is 5%. Between these, the most plausible is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). \n\nWait, but if the number of plasmids is four in 50,000, that's a very low frequency. The expected frequency without recombination would be higher, so recombination must be high. Maybe around 2% as in option B. Alternatively, considering the dilution effect, the required percentage might be lower. \n\nAfter thinking through, I believe the correct answer is F (0.3%), as it aligns with the observed low frequency of plasmids.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "rollout": " coli's culture is divided into two halves, each treated differently.\n\nThe first half is dilute enough that half of them die, while the other half don't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't causing any issue here since it just kills some cells. So the death rate in this half must be due to the lysogenic mutation not being effective against strain B. That means the lysogenic mutation isn't involved in the problem.\n\nThen, the second half is more dilute (diluted 1:10^5), and when plated on strain K, there are four plques. Since four plques are found on strain K, which has the mutation that allows it to lyse strain B, we know that at least four of these should have died. But wait, if the lysogenic mutation wasn't active in the first half, maybe the lysogenic mutation was effective in the second half? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues because it killed some cells in the first half, indicating that its mutation isn't active against strain B.\n\nWait, no, the lysogenic phage would kill all cells unless their mutation is neutralized. If the lysogenic phage caused issues, then in the first half where the lysogenic phage didn't kill anything, the lysogenic mutation might still be functional. But in the second half, where the lysogenic phage did kill cells, that suggests that the lysogenic mutation isn't working, meaning it's neutralizing or is harmful.\n\nBut let's think about the test. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) shows that half die, suggesting that the lysogenic phage isn't active against strain B, so its mutation isn't causing issues. Therefore, the lysogenic mutation must be neutralizing the lysogenic effect or making it ineffective. Now, looking at the second half (diluted 1:10^5): when plated on strain K, four plques appear. Since four plques form clusters around the spot, that indicates that four cells have been lysed by the lysogenic phage. Given that the lysogenic phage didn't affect the first half, it must be that the lysogenic mutation is neutralizing the lysogenic effect, allowing it to lyse strain B without killing any cells.\n\nNow, considering the double mutation scenario: when both mutantphages are present, only the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B. The other half, when dilute 1:10^7, is expected to have similar outcomes as before. Wait, but according to the experiment, only the lysogenic phage caused problems when mixed with both mutants. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. The initial infection by mutantphages alone leads to lytic fission in strain B but lysogenic in strain K. When both are present, strain B's E. coli is split, and half dies. That suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues with strain B, implying that the lysogenic mutation isn't functional in this context. Therefore, the lysogenic mutation must be neutralizing the lysogenic effect, allowing it to lyse strain B.\n\nSo, the lysogenic mutation is causing issues when it interacts with another phage (the lysogenic phage). In the presence of both mutantphages, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, leading to death. Now, when the other half is treated with the lysogenic phage and then plated on strain K, four plques are found. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is effectively killing strain B cells because it's neutralizing the lysogenic effect. So, the lysogenic mutation is now acting on the lysogenic phage itself, meaning it's neutralizing its own effect.\n\nTherefore, when the lysogenic phage is mixed with normal phages, only the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, which requires a recombination event where the lysogenic mutation is neutralizing the lysogenic effect. However, when both mutantphages are present, including the lysogenic phage, it's possible that the recombination hasn't occurred yet because the lysogenic phage's mutation isn't active.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination typically refers to the point mutation creating a new sequence. Here, it seems like the lysogenic phage's mutation is neutralizing its own activity, which could indicate a recombination event if the lysogenic phage's mutation created a new sequence. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing it to lyse strain B, that might suggest that the lysogenic phage's mutation is neutralizing the lysogenic effect, possibly through a recombination event where the lysogenic mutation creates a new sequence that prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination could refer to the point mutation that makes the lysogenic phage's DNA non-functional, effectively neutralizing its own activity. So, the recombination would involve creating a new sequence that makes the lysogenic phage unable to replicate or lyse the target cell.\n\nGiven that, the number of recombinant sites determines the recombination frequency. If the lysogenic mutation is at one site, the recombination frequency would depend on the number of recombinant alleles. However, the question provides specific numbers of plques on each strain after treatment, which may help determine the likelihood of recombination.\n\nIn the first half, when the lysogenic phage isn't active, the lysogenic mutation isn't causing issues, so it's likely that the lysogenic mutation isn't neutralizing anything yet. Then, when both mutantphages are present, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, requiring that the lysogenic mutation isn't active anymore. So, perhaps the lysogenic mutation is inactivated in the presence of the lysogenic phage, indicating that the lysogenic mutation has already recombined with the phage's mutation.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage's mutation is neutralizing the lysogenic effect, that suggests that the lysogenic mutation is inactivated, which could happen during recombination if the lysogeny mutagenesis creates a new sequence that disrupts replication. So, the number of plques formed when both mutants are present might relate to how many times the lysogenic mutation has recombined with the phage's mutation.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation might require knowing the recombination fraction, which depends on the number of recombinant alleles. If the lysogenic mutation is at one site, and the phage's mutation is at another, the recombination frequency would be determined by the number of times the two sequences have recombined.\n\nBut given the results provided, when both mutants are present, only the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, which implies that the lysogenic mutation isn't active anymore. Therefore, the lysogenic mutation must have recombined with the phage's mutation, meaning that the lysogenic mutation is part of a new sequence created by recombination.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombinants, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic mutation is at one locus and the phage's mutation is at another, and recombination occurs once, then the number of recombinants would correspond to the number of plques on strain K.\n\nLooking back, when both mutants are present, the result is that only the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, which suggests that the lysogenic mutation is neutralized by the phage's mutation. Therefore, the lysogenic mutation is likely inactivated, meaning it has recombined with the phage's mutation.\n\nIf the lysogenic mutation is at one locus, and the phage's mutation is at another, and recombination occurs once, then the number of recombinants would be proportional to the number of plques observed.\n\nBut in this case, when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, which implies that the lysogenic mutation has recombined with the phage's mutation. Therefore, the number of recombinants is equal to the number of plques observed on strain K, which is 4.\n\nSimilarly, when only the lysogenic phage is present, the lysogenic mutation isn't recombining, so the number of plques on strain K remains zero.\n\nWait, no, actually, when only the lysogenic phage is present, and both mutants are not, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse strain B. But when both are present, the lysogenic phage does lyse strain B, which suggests that the lysogenic mutation has recombined with the phage's mutation.\n\nTherefore, the number of recombinants is equal to the number of plques on strain K, which is 4, compared to the total number of plques, which is 4 (from strain K) + 40 (from strain B).\n\nWait, no, actually, when both mutants are present, the plques are distributed between the two strains. The total number of plques is 40 (on strain B) + 4 (on strain K) = 44 plques.\n\nOut of these, 4 are on strain K, suggesting that the lysogenic mutation recombined with the phage's mutation. Therefore, the recombination frequency is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the number of recombinants corresponds to the number of plques on strain K.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, indicating that the lysogenic mutation has recombined with the phage's mutation. Therefore, the number of recombinants is equal to the number of plques on strain K, which is 4, over the total plques, which is 44. So 4/44 is approximately 9%, which is close to option F (0.3%) but that's much lower. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic mutation is neutralized by the phage's mutation, then the number of recombinants is proportional to the number of times the lysogenic mutation has recombined. So, if the lysogenic mutation is at one site and the phage's mutation at another, and recombination occurs once, then each time the lysogenic mutation has recombined, it can lyse strain B. Therefore, the number of recombinants would be equal to the number of plques on strain K, which is 4.\n\nThus, the number of recombinants is 4, and the total possible is 44. So the recombination frequency is 4/44 \u2248 9%. However, none of the options match exactly, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the lysogenic mutation is neutralizing the lysogenic effect, so it's inactivated, meaning it's no longer able to lyse strain B. Therefore, the number of plques on strain K should reflect the number of times the lysogenic mutation has been neutralized. But when both mutants are present, only the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, which would mean that the lysogenic mutation has been neutralized by the phage's mutation.\n\nSo, the number of recombinants is 4, as seen on strain K. The total number of plques is 44, so 4/44 is approximately 9%, which doesn't align with any of the given options. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between the plques and recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinants is directly related to the number of plques on strain K. Since only 4 plques were found on strain K when both mutants were present, and assuming that the lysogenic mutation recombined once, the recombination frequency would be 4/44 \u2248 9%, which again doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plques on strain K is equal to the number of times the lysogenic mutation has recombined. Each recombination event increases the number of plques. So, if only one recombination event occurred, you'd expect fewer plques than if multiple events happened.\n\nIn this case, when both mutants are present, only the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, which suggests that the lysogenic mutation has recombined once. Therefore, the number of recombinants is 1, and the total possible is 44, giving a recombination frequency of 1/44 \u2248 2.27%, which rounds to 2.3%, corresponding to option B (2%).\n\nThat makes sense because if only one recombination event occurred, you'd get a certain number of plques, and the higher the number of recombination events, the more plques you'd observe.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n- When only lysogenic phage is present, lysogenic mutation isn't recombining, so no recombination.\n- When both mutants are present, lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, indicating one recombination event.\n- Number of recombinants = 1.\n- Total plques = 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44.\n- Recombination frequency = 1/44 \u2248 2.27% \u2192 2% when rounded.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli's culture is divided into two halves, each treated differently.\n\nThe first half is dilute enough that half of them die, while the other half don't.

Therefore, the number of recombinants is 1, and the total possible is 44, giving a recombination frequency of 1/44 \u2248 2.27%, which rounds to 2.3%, corresponding to option B (2%).\n\nThat makes sense because if only one recombination event occurred, you'd get a certain number of plques, and the higher the number of recombination events, the more plques you'd observe.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n- When only lysogenic phage is present, lysogenic mutation isn't recombining, so no recombination.\n- When both mutants are present, lysogenic phage can lyse strain B, indicating one recombination event.\n- Number of recombinants = 1.\n- Total plques = 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44.\n- Recombination frequency = 1/44 \u2248 2.27% \u2192 2% when rounded.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

One half is then dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\n\nThe results are four plumes on K and 40 on B. I'm supposed to determine the recombination percentage between the two mutations. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the experiment involves two phases: dilution and plating. In the first phase, the phages are mixed with E. coli strain B, and both types are present. The cells should divide into two, each with half the concentration. Then, one half is further diluted 1:10^7, meaning it becomes 10^(-7) times more concentrated. The other half is diluted 1:10^5, which is 10^(-5) times more concentrated.\n\nWhen these are plated on the respective bacterial strains, the number of plumes indicates how many times the phage was able to replicate without overlapping. Each successful replication adds a new plume. The total number of plumes depends on the dilution factors and the likelihood of successful replication.\n\nSince only lysogenic phages affect strain B, their presence would cause issues in the B culture. The fact that both types of phages are present suggests some interaction, possibly leading to co-infecting or causing certain plasmid structures to interfere.\n\nNow, considering the recombination frequency, it relates to the probability that the two mutation sites are inherited together from a common ancestor. Recombination occurs during meiosis, and if the two mutations are close together, the chance is higher. If they're far apart, the chance is lower.\n\nIn genetic crosses, the number of recombinant offspring is calculated based on the percentage of recombination. For example, if the map distance is x centimeters, and you have a test cross, the expected recombinant ratio is 2x/(1+2x).\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're dealing with a scenario where both mutations are present, affecting different bacterial strains. So maybe the number of plumes observed is related to the likelihood of the mutations occurring in the same host cell, indicating recombination.\n\nGiven that four plumes appeared on K and 40 on B, the ratio is 1:10. This seems low, suggesting fewer instances where both mutations occurred together. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the likelihood of each mutation being present independently.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the probability of each mutation occurring. If the recombination frequency (RF) is r, then the probability of an individual having both mutations is (1 - r)/2. Wait, no\u2014actually, RF is the proportion of gametes where the two alleles are inherited together. So the formula for RF is (number of parental types)/(total possible).\n\nBut in this context, since both mutations are present, and they affect different bacterial lines, the occurrence of both mutations in the same daughter cell would indicate recombination.\n\nWait, the initial experiment shows that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So any plasmids carrying both mutations would be problematic for B, but not K. Now, when the cells are plated again, the dilution affects whether those mutations are passed along.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, say 98%, then most cells will have both mutations, but that contradicts the results. Alternatively, if the RF is low, like 1%, then only a small fraction of cells would carry both mutations.\n\nLooking at the results, the number of plumes on K is much higher than on B. That could suggest that the K strain has more cells with the mutated phage, implying that the mutation didn't occur in all cells, or that there was some instability.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in plumes might relate to the likelihood of each mutation being present independently. Since four were on K and 40 on B, that's roughly a 1:10 ratio. If each mutation has an independent probability p, then the expected number of cells with both mutations would be N * p^2. Here, N is the total number of cells, which might be around 4 + 40 = 44, but actually, each half is a separate population.\n\nWait, the way it's done: one half is plated on B and another on K. So each half represents a separate population. The number of plumes per half determines the likelihood of mutation within that population.\n\nSo, for the B half: 4 plumes, which implies that the chance of both mutations appearing in each cell is 4 / (number of cells in B half). Similarly for K, 40 plumes mean 40 / (number of cells in K half).\n\nAssuming each half has the same number of cells, the ratio of plumes would reflect the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring in each half. If the two mutations are linked, their frequencies would multiply, and the probability of both occurring would be (frequency of mutation A) * (frequency of mutation B), adjusted for recombination.\n\nBut without knowing the exact frequencies, it's tricky. However, the key point is that the recombination frequency can be determined by comparing the expected and observed plume counts.\n\nIn this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects B, any plasmid with both mutations would be problematic for B. The observed ratio of plumes (40 vs. 4) suggests that the likelihood of the mutation occurring in the K strain is tenfold higher than in B. This could imply a high level of recombination, as more plasmids would carry the mutation.\n\nBut looking at the options, the highest recombination frequency given is 5% (option G). However, the numbers seem off. If the recombination frequency were 1%, the expected number of plumes with both mutations would be lower. Conversely, a higher RF would lead to more plumes having both mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. The number of plumes observed is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. Because plumes are randomly distributed, the probability of both mutations appearing in the same daughter cell is related to the square of the RF. So the number of such cells would be sqrt(RF) times the expected value.\n\nFor example, if RF is 1%, then sqrt(0.01)=0.1, so the number of plumes would be 0.1 times the expected count.\n\nIn our case, the observed number of plumes on K is 40. Suppose the expected number without recombination would be lower, say X. Then 40 = X * sqrt(0.01) => X=40/0.1=400. But this might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely related to the square root of the RF. So if RF is R, then the number of plumes would be proportional to 1/sqrt(R). Therefore, if RF is 5%, 1/sqrt(0.05)\u22481.414. If the expected without recombination is, say, 32 (since 40/1.414\u224828; maybe approximate), then that supports a moderate RF.\n\nBut without precise calculations, it's hard to pin down exactly. Given the answer choices, option F is 0.3 percent, which is somewhat plausible but not the highest. Option G is 5%, which is quite high, but my intuition says that the observed ratio is closer to 1:10, which might correspond to a lower RF.\n\nWait, another angle: The number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells that successfully acquired both mutations. So if the RF is R, then the probability of both mutations in a cell is R/2 (assuming no interference). But if they do interfere, the effective RF decreases.\n\nIn the absence of interference, the expected number of plumes would be 2*(R/2) = R. But here, we see 40 on K and 4 on B, which are much larger than 1%. It suggests a much lower RF.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the probability of recombination. The number of recombinant offspring is approximately 2p(1-p), where p is the recombination frequency. But in this case, the number of plumes isn't directly mapping to recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate the likelihood of recombination. If the two mutations are tightly linked, fewer plumes would have both mutations. The observed ratio is 1:10, which is a significant imbalance. This suggests that the recombination frequency is high enough that only a small fraction of cells carry both mutations.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices go beyond 5%. So perhaps the correct answer is G, 0.5 percent, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the likelihood of both mutations occurring is 10 times higher in one strain compared to the other. This could imply a very low recombination frequency because more plasmids would carry both mutations.\n\nIf RF were 0.1 percent, then the expected number of plumes with both mutations would be much less. But the observed is 40, which is much higher, so perhaps the RF is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct calculation is that the number of plumes corresponds to the square root of the RF. So if RF is R, then the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(R). Therefore, if RF is R, then the number of plumes N = k*sqrt(R), where k is a constant.\n\nGiven that, if RF is R, then N^2 = k^2*R. So if we know N, we can solve for R.\n\nIn our case, N_K = 40, N_B = 4. Assuming the same k, then:\n\n(40)^2 \u2248 R_K,\n\n(4)^2 \u2248 R_B.\n\nBut R_K is likely much higher than R_B, which makes sense because K is a different strain, potentially with a different chromosome number or structure, making the phage life cycle longer and thus harder to infect.\n\nSo R_K is probably 1600 times R_B. If RF is the same for both, that would imply a huge difference in plume counts, which contradicts the idea that RF is consistent across strains. Hence, the assumption must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plumes reflects the square of the RF. So:\n\nN^2 = RF.\n\nTherefore, RF = N^2.\n\nFor K: N=40 \u2192 RF=1600.\n\nFor B: N=4 \u2192 RF=16.\n\nThis still doesn't fit, because RF cannot exceed 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of RF.\n\nThus, RF = (1/N)^2.\n\nFor K: RF = (1/40)^2 \u2248 0.000625.\n\nFor B: RF = (1/4)^2 = 0.0625.\n\nBut RF can't be negative or over 100%. These values don't make sense either.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to think about the expected number of recombinant offspring. The formula is:\n\nExpected recombinants = 2 * p * q * N,\n\nwhere p is the frequency of one allele, q of the other, and N is the number of individuals.\n\nBut in this case, the plumes represent the occurrence of both mutations in the same daughter cell. So the expected number of such plumes would be proportional to p*q*N.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, p and q are dependent. So the expectation would be E = p^2*N * 2.\n\nBut without knowing p and q individually, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate the likelihood of recombination. If the RF is R, then the probability of recombining is R/2 (for two homologous chromosomes).\n\nGiven that, the expected number of plumes would be 2*(R/2)*N = R*N.\n\nSo, for K: expected plumes = R_K * N_K.\n\nSimilarly, for B: expected plumes = R_B * N_B.\n\nBut since the two strains have different N values (one may have more cells due to shorter plating time?), this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the number of plumes reflects the likelihood of recombination, with the ratio giving insight into the relative recombination frequencies between the two strains.\n\nIn the end, I think the best approach is to look for the standard method used in recombinant testing. Typically, when both mutants are present and affect different organisms, the number of plumes can be used to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombinant plumes = (Number of plumes with both mutations) = (Total plumes) * (R/2),\n\nwhere R is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut without specific data on N, it's challenging. However, given the options, I think the intended answer is B. 2 percent. But I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

One half is treated with a high-dilution (1:10^7) plating on strain B, and the other with a lower-dilution (1:10^5) plating on strain K. \n\nFrom the experiment, we have four pluses on K and 40 on B. Plaques indicate successful infection, so higher numbers mean more successful infections. Let's think about what each treatment represents. High dilution means fewer cells, so higher chance of plating and causing successful infections. Lower dilution means more cells, so lower chance of plating successfully.\n\nSo, if the two mutations cause different fission methods, some cells might be resistant to one method but susceptible to another. Recombination would imply that the mutations interfere with each other's replication or transduction effects. If they're independent, the probability of a cell being resistant to both mutations would be the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of resistance for each mutation as r1 and r2. Since the phages cause different outcomes, these resistances might be linked. For example, if one mutation makes the phage lytic (resistant to lysogenic), and the other makes it lysogenic (resistant to lytic), then the combined effect could lead to some cells being resistant to both.\n\nIn the high dilution test (strain B), the number of successful infections depends on whether the phages were lysogenic or not. If the lysogenic phage didn't lyse the cell, it would survive and replicate, leading to lytic fission. Conversely, the lytic phage would die immediately upon replicating. So, any cells where the lysogenic phage caused lysis would not survive the lytic cycle, making them resistant to lysis.\n\nIn the low dilution test (strain K), the presence of both phages would compete for replication sites. If the phages' mutations interfere with each other's replication, some cells might be resistant to both, leading to fewer successful infections compared to random plating.\n\nThe number of pluses observed will help us determine how many cells are resistant to both mutations. The formula for expected pluses under complete independence is N * (1 - r1)(1 - r2). Here, N is the total number of cells plated, which should be similar across both treatments since the dilutions are inversely proportional to N.\n\nWait, actually, in the high dilution, the concentration is much higher, so the number of cells is lower. In the low dilution, the concentration is lower, so the number of cells is higher. To compare, let's assume N_high = 1e6 and N_low = 1e5 for simplicity.\n\nIn high dilution:\nExpected pluses = N_high * (1 - r1)(1 - r2)\nBut since the phage is lysogenic, r1=1 (since lysogenic phages don't lyse). Wait no, r1 is the frequency of resistance, so if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, then the lysogenic phage is always resistant to lytic fission, meaning r2=1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are either lysogenic or non-lysogenic. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, then it would lyse the cell, making it resistant to lytic fission. Conversely, the non-lysogenic phage would lyse the cell, making it resistant to lysogenic.\n\nWait, no. Actually, phages that cause lysis (lytic) typically make copies of themselves before replicating, whereas lysogenic phages integrate their genes and replicate within the host without necessarily causing lysis. So, a lysogenic phage would lyse the cell if replicated, while a non-lysogenic phage (like the standard ones) would just replicate within the cell without causing lysis.\n\nSo, if you have a population of cells, some will have lysogenic phages that lyse and others won't. Similarly, with mutantphages carrying mutations in the T_4 genome, they may have different fission strategies.\n\nNow, considering the experiment: in the high dilution (strain B), which is likely more susceptible to lysis due to the presence of lysogenic phages, only those cells where the lysogenic phage didn't lyse would remain viable. These cells would be resistant to lysis. However, the phage itself carries mutations, so perhaps it's lysogenic (non-lysed) or non-lytic (lysed).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me approach it differently. Suppose the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it survives and replicates, causing lysis. The non-lytic phage (which isn't mentioned here) would lyse the cell. Now, the mutantphages have certain mutations that affect their ability to replicate or replicate within the cell.\n\nIf the mutantphages are either non-lytic or non-lytic-like, they would lyse the cell regardless. But if they have mutations that prevent replication or allow for alternative replication mechanisms, they could become resistant.\n\nSo, the high dilution would show cells where the lysogenic phage didn't lyse, indicating resistance to lysis. The low dilution would show cells where both phages are resistant, depending on their mutations.\n\nGiven that, the presence of 4 pluses in the high dilution suggests that 4% of the cells are resistant to lysis. Similarly, in the low dilution, 40 pluses suggest 4% of cells are resistant to both mutations. That seems contradictory unless there's an interference between the mutations.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that the high dilution has 4 pluses, and the low dilution has 40. If they're independent, the expected pluses in low dilution should be less than in high dilution, assuming independence. Let me calculate the expected pluses.\n\nAssuming that the resistance in the high dilution is due to the lysogenic phage being non-lytic, and in the low dilution, both mutations are interfering.\n\nLet\u2019s say in high dilution, r1 = 0 (all cells are resistant to lysis), so all cells are resistant to lysis from the lysogenic phage, but the non-lytic phage could cause further resistance. Alternatively, if both phages are non-lytic-like, then their presence would lyse the cell.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should use the concept of recombination frequency. Recombination refers to interference between mutations, affecting the likelihood of both occurring. If two mutations are recombined, the probability of their occurrence together is reduced.\n\nIn the context of phages, if the two mutations are recombined, it affects their replication or transduction efficiency. So, the number of cells showing resistance to both mutations would decrease because the mutations interfere with each other.\n\nThe formula for recombinant frequencies in genetic crosses is often expressed using the chi-squared test, but in phage experiments, it's sometimes simpler. The expected number of recombinants (cells resistant to both) can be calculated based on the product of their individual probabilities of resistance.\n\nGiven that, in the high dilution, the number of pluses indicates the fraction of cells resistant to lysis. Let's say p1 = 0.04 (4%) in high dilution. Then, in the low dilution, q = p1 * p2, where p2 is the fraction resistant to the second mutation.\n\nIf q = 0.04 / 100 (but wait, in the low dilution, the number is 40 pluses on 1e5 cells, so q = 0.0004). But that doesn't align with the high dilution's 0.04. This suggests that the mutations are linked, as the products differ significantly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the ratios. If the mutations are recombinant, then q = p1 * p2. Let\u2019s set up the equation:\n\np_high = p1 * p2\np_low = p1 * p2\n\nBut p_high is the fraction resistant to lysis from the lysogenic phage, and p_low is the fraction resistant to both mutations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express the expected number of recombinant plasmids (both mutations) as N_low * (1 - r1)(1 - r2). Given that, and knowing N_low and the actual plasmid count, we can solve for the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. If the two mutations are independent, the number of cells resistant to both would be the product of their individual resistances. If they're recombined, this product would be less than expected.\n\nGiven the data:\nHigh dilution (strain B): 4 pluses on 1e6 cells \u2192 p1 = 4/1e6 = 0.000004.\nLow dilution (strain K): 40 pluses on 1e5 cells \u2192 p2 = 40/1e5 = 0.004.\n\nIf independent, p_low = p1 * p2 \u2192 0.000004 * 0.004 = 1.6e-8. But this contradicts the actual p_low of 0.004. So, they must be related.\n\nInstead, perhaps the high dilution corresponds to cells resistant to the first mutation (lysogenic), and the low dilution corresponds to cells resistant to the second mutation. Thus, the overall recombination would be determined by how the two mutations interact.\n\nIf the mutations are recombined, the probability of both occurring is reduced. So, the expected number of cells resistant to both would be N_low * (1 - r1)(1 - r2). But since the mutations are recombined, this expectation would be less than expected for independent events.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the high dilution, the number of plasmids (resistant to lysis) is 4, and in the low dilution, the number is 40, the ratio between them is 10. This suggests that the interference reduces the success rate by a factor of 10, implying a 90% efficiency loss, which is very high. This would happen if the mutations are completely recombined, leading to a 1% recombination frequency.\n\nWait, 90% efficiency loss would correspond to a recombination frequency of around 1%. Because 1% recombination would reduce the probability of both mutations occurring to 99%, leaving only 1% chance for both, thus reducing the number of plasmids by almost 99%.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if the mutations are recombined at a frequency of 1%, then the expected number of plasmids would be 99% of the maximum possible. Therefore, the answer would be approximately 1%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains divide into halves. One half is treated with a high-dilution (1:10^7) plating on strain B, and the other with a lower-dilution (1:10^5) plating on strain K. \n\nFrom the experiment, we have four pluses on K and 40 on B. Plaques indicate successful infection, so higher numbers mean more successful infections. Let's think about what each treatment represents. High dilution means fewer cells, so higher chance of plating and causing successful infections. Lower dilution means more cells, so lower chance of plating successfully.\n\nSo, if the two mutations cause different fission methods, some cells might be resistant to one method but susceptible to another. Recombination would imply that the mutations interfere with each other's replication or transduction effects. If they're independent, the probability of a cell being resistant to both mutations would be the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of resistance for each mutation as r1 and r2. Since the phages cause different outcomes, these resistances might be linked. For example, if one mutation makes the phage lytic (resistant to lysogenic), and the other makes it lysogenic (resistant to lytic), then the combined effect could lead to some cells being resistant to both.\n\nIn the high dilution test (strain B), the number of successful infections depends on whether the phages were lysogenic or not. If the lysogenic phage didn't lyse the cell, it would survive and replicate, leading to lytic fission. Conversely, the lytic phage would die immediately upon replicating. So, any cells where the lysogenic phage caused lysis would not survive the lytic cycle, making them resistant to lysis.\n\nIn the low dilution test (strain K), the presence of both phages would compete for replication sites. If the phages' mutations interfere with each other's replication, some cells might be resistant to both, leading to fewer successful infections compared to random plating.\n\nThe number of pluses observed will help us determine how many cells are resistant to both mutations. The formula for expected pluses under complete independence is N * (1 - r1)(1 - r2). Here, N is the total number of cells plated, which should be similar across both treatments since the dilutions are inversely proportional to N.\n\nWait, actually, in the high dilution, the concentration is much higher, so the number of cells is lower. In the low dilution, the concentration is lower, so the number of cells is higher. To compare, let's assume N_high = 1e6 and N_low = 1e5 for simplicity.\n\nIn high dilution:\nExpected pluses = N_high * (1 - r1)(1 - r2)\nBut since the phage is lysogenic, r1=1 (since lysogenic phages don't lyse). Wait no, r1 is the frequency of resistance, so if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, then the lysogenic phage is always resistant to lytic fission, meaning r2=1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are either lysogenic or non-lysogenic. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, then it would lyse the cell, making it resistant to lytic fission. Conversely, the non-lysogenic phage would lyse the cell, making it resistant to lysogenic.\n\nWait, no. Actually, phages that cause lysis (lytic) typically make copies of themselves before replicating, whereas lysogenic phages integrate their genes and replicate within the host without necessarily causing lysis. So, a lysogenic phage would lyse the cell if replicated, while a non-lysogenic phage (like the standard ones) would just replicate within the cell without causing lysis.\n\nSo, if you have a population of cells, some will have lysogenic phages that lyse and others won't. Similarly, with mutantphages carrying mutations in the T_4 genome, they may have different fission strategies.\n\nNow, considering the experiment: in the high dilution (strain B), which is likely more susceptible to lysis due to the presence of lysogenic phages, only those cells where the lysogenic phage didn't lyse would remain viable.

The low dilution would show cells where both phages are resistant, depending on their mutations.\n\nGiven that, the presence of 4 pluses in the high dilution suggests that 4% of the cells are resistant to lysis. Similarly, in the low dilution, 40 pluses suggest 4% of cells are resistant to both mutations. That seems contradictory unless there's an interference between the mutations.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that the high dilution has 4 pluses, and the low dilution has 40. If they're independent, the expected pluses in low dilution should be less than in high dilution, assuming independence. Let me calculate the expected pluses.\n\nAssuming that the resistance in the high dilution is due to the lysogenic phage being non-lytic, and in the low dilution, both mutations are interfering.\n\nLet\u2019s say in high dilution, r1 = 0 (all cells are resistant to lysis), so all cells are resistant to lysis from the lysogenic phage, but the non-lytic phage could cause further resistance.

One part is then plated on strain B's lawn, and the other on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe results show four pluses on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's. I remember that recombination refers to the interaction between two genes; if there's no recombination, the mutations don't influence each other, and their effects would be additive. If there is recombination, they interact, reducing the total effect compared to independent assortment.\n\nSo, let's think about how the results relate to recombination. In a scenario with complete recombination (no interference), the number of recombinant offspring should be around 50% of the non-recombinant ones. But here, we're dealing with a situation where both types of phages might interfere with each other, which could affect the outcome.\n\nWait, actually, since the experiment involves multiple plating stages, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me recall the basic principles. If two mutations are recombined, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is lower than expected without recombination. So, in terms of the plating results, the presence of both mutations on a bacterium would lead to more lysis, but here, the effect isn't as straightforward because some bacteria have both mutations but aren't necessarily showing the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids. After splitting, one half is plated on strain B and the other on strain K. If there's recombination, the proportion of recombinant plasmids would depend on the frequency of recombination events.\n\nLet me calculate the observed recombinant plasmid load. Since each half is plated separately, the number of recombinant plasmids in each half would depend on the overall recombination rate. However, the problem states that only strain B was affected, implying that the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, while the lysogenic phage did. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the first case, only the lysogenic phage caused issue, but in the second case, both were present, and only the lysogenic phage caused issue again?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- In the initial infection of strain B, only the lysogenic phage (which causes lysis) does anything. The lysogenic phage also carries a mutation in rII, which likely affects its ability to replicate or integrate into the genome.\n- Then, the E. coli splits, and half is plated on strain B's lawn (so the original lysogenic phage's mutation in rII may still affect this half) and the other half is plated on strain K's lawn (where the lysogenic phage's mutation in rII may not be as effective, but wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage's mutation in rII is in the phage itself, not in the host E. coli. So, when it integrates into the host, it affects replication, but the host's own mutation in rII (like a deletion or point mutation) might affect its function.\n\nBut perhaps I'm mixing up things. Let me approach this differently.\n\nIn the experiment:\n- First, all E. coli strain B are treated with two types of mutantphages: one causing lysogeny and another causing rII mutation.\n- All these phages die upon lysis, meaning only those that replicate survive.\n- The resulting colonies are split into two equal halves. One half is plated on strain B's lawn, expecting that any rII mutation would lead to more lysis, but perhaps less due to competition.\n- The other half is plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe result is four pluses on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's. This suggests that the strain K's lawn had fewer recombinant plasmids, indicating less recombination. Conversely, strain B's lawn had more recombinant plasmids, suggesting more recombination.\n\nWait, but the phages are the same except for their rII mutation. Hmm, perhaps the lysogenic phage's rII mutation in strain B affects its ability to integrate into the host, leading to more lysis. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage's rII mutation in strain K might not affect integration, so it doesn't cause as much lysis.\n\nBut according to the results, the strain B half had more plasmids (more recombinants) than strain K. That implies that the lysogenic phage from strain B has a higher recombination rate with the T_4 phage compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nWait, but both mutantphages are the same except for their rII mutation. No, wait\u2014the mutantphages are different types: one is lysogenic and causes lysis, and the other is lysogenic too but possibly with a different rII mutation? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B has a different rII mutation that makes it more efficient at integrating or replicating, leading to more lysis.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that the recombination rate affects the distribution of the mutants across the plating media.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is the percentage of gametes that are recombinant, i.e., contain both alleles from different chromosomes. It's typically measured using a test cross or a chi-square test comparing observed vs expected frequencies.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, we're dealing with a double mutant system, and the results involve the combination of two mutations. So, perhaps the recombination frequency can be inferred from the observed number of recombinant plasmids.\n\nIf there's no recombination, all plasmids would either have the lysogenic phage or the lysogenic phage plus the rII mutation, but not both. So, the expectation would be that half of the plasmids have the lysogenic phage and half have the lysogenic phage plus the rII mutation.\n\nBut in reality, the number of recombinant plasmids depends on the recombination rate. The more recombination, the more recombinant plasmids you'd expect.\n\nGiven that the strain B half had more plasmids than strain K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B had a higher recombination rate with the T_4 phage compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, perhaps the recombination frequency is related to the observed number of recombinant plasmids.\n\nIn a typical test cross, the expected recombinant count is N * (1 - R), where R is the recombination frequency. Alternatively, using a chi-square test, the expected counts can be calculated.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are on different chromosomes, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the recombination frequency.\n\nIn this case, the experiment shows that strain B's half has more plasmids than strain K's. If there were no recombination, the numbers would be similar. Any difference indicates some degree of recombination.\n\nGiven that the results are four pluses on strain K and 40 on strain B, the ratio is approximately 1:10. This suggests that the recombination event occurred once in every ten bacteria. Because the sample size is small (only a few plating events), the recombination frequency can be estimated as the reciprocal of the number of plating events per bacteria.\n\nWait, but each half is plated separately, so each half represents a generation. If the recombination happened once in every 10 bacteria, the recombination frequency would be 1/10 = 0.1, or 10%.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, 0.1 percent is option D. However, sometimes recombination frequencies are reported as percentages, so 10% would correspond to 0.1 percent when considering the entire population.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s confusing. Let me clarify: recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, representing the proportion of offspring that carry both parental chromosomes (i.e., the recombining chromosome). For example, a recombination frequency of 0.1% would mean that 0.1% of the offspring carry both parental chromosomes, but that seems very low. Alternatively, if we consider the number of recombinant plasmids, perhaps it's better to express it as a fraction.\n\nIn our case, the number of plasmids in each half is proportional to the recombination. If strain B had more plasmids, the recombination must have occurred more often in strain B's half. The observed ratio is 40 plasmids on B's half versus 4 on K's half, totaling 44 plasmids. Each plasmid represents a single mutation event.\n\nThe expected ratio under no recombination would be 1:1, giving 22 plasmids on each half. The observed ratio deviates from this, indicating some recombination. To quantify the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (Rf) = (Observed Recombinant Plasmids / Total Plasmids) * 100%\n\nBut in this case, the recombination occurs within each half, so it's a bit more complex. Alternatively, the chi-square test can determine whether the observed data fits the expected under no recombination.\n\nUsing the observed counts (O_B = 40, O_K = 4):\n\nExpected under no recombination: E_B = E_K = 22.\n\nChi-square statistic = [(40 - 22)^2 + (4 - 22)^2] / (22 + 22)\n\n= [28^2 + (-18)^2] / 44\n\n= (784 + 324) / 44\n\n= 1108 / 44 \u2248 25.18\n\nLooking up the critical value for chi-square with 1 degree of freedom at \u03b1=0.05 is about 3.84. Our chi-square is much larger, indicating significant deviation from no recombination. Thus, there must be some recombination.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can use the likelihood ratio test. The log likelihood ratio statistic is given by:\n\n2 * ln(L_observed / L_expected)\n\nWhere L_expected = (N_B! / (E_B! O_B!)) * (N_K! / (E_K! O_K!))\n\nAnd L_observed = (N_B! / (E_B! O_B!)) * (N_K! / (E_K! O_K!))\n\nSince N_B + N_K = 44, and E_B = E_K = 22,\n\nL_expected = (44)! / ((22!)^2)\n\nL_observed = (40! * 4!) / (22! * 22! )\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nL_ratio = (40! * 4!) / (44!)\n\n= (1 / (43*44)) ) * (4! / 40! )) \n\n= (1 / (43*44)) ) * (24)\n\n\u2248 24 / (1892) \u2248 0.01267\n\nln(L_ratio) \u2248 -2.02\n\nThus, \u03c7\u00b2 = 2*(-2.02) = 4.04\n\nComparing to the critical value of 3.84, we reject the null hypothesis of no recombination. Now, to find the recombination frequency, we can compute the maximum likelihood estimate.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nRF = 2 * (O_B - E_B) / (Total Plasmids)\n\n= 2*(40 - 22)/44\n\n= 2*18/44\n\n= 36/44 \u2248 0.818\n\nThis suggests an 81.8% recombination rate, which contradicts my earlier thought process. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (O_B - E_B) / (Total Plasmids)\n\nWhich would be (40 - 22)/44 = 18/44 \u2248 0.409, or 40.9%. But this doesn't align with the chi-square calculation.\n\nHmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I should look for a simpler way. Given that strain B had more plasmids, and assuming each plasmid represents a mutation, the recombination must have occurred more frequently in strain B's half.\n\nThe observed ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. Under no recombination, this would be 22:22. The difference suggests that recombination has increased the proportion in strain B's half.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, perhaps it's easier to assume that the expected number of recombinants is proportional to the difference in plating ratios.\n\nThe observed ratio is 40/(40+4)= 80%, and the expected under no recombination is 50%. Thus, the increase is 30%, which suggests that the recombination frequency is 30% of the possible recombinations. However, this approach is heuristic and might not be accurate.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRF = (O_B - E_B) / (O_B + E_B)\n\n= (40 - 22)/(40 + 22)\n\n= 18/62 \u2248 0.290, or 29%.\n\nBut this is just an approximation. Considering the options provided, none match exactly, but option C is 1.5%, which is close to 29% scaled down by a factor. However, this doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. The experiment involved two plating stages: one with strain B and one with strain K. Each half is then plated on one lawn. The result is four pluses on B's lawn and 40 on K's. This means that only 40 plasmids survived in the B half and 4 in the K half.\n\nIf there's recombination, the proportion of recombinant plasmids would depend on the recombination rate. Assuming that the recombination happens uniformly, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be proportional to the recombination frequency.\n\nGiven that strain B's half had more plasmids, the recombination must have occurred more frequently there. Let's say the recombination frequency is R. Then, the expected number of recombinant plasmids in strain B's half would be R * 44, and in strain K's half, (1-R)*44.\n\nBut the observed numbers are 40 and 4, respectively. So:\n\nR * 44 \u2248 40 => R \u2248 40/44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%\n\nBut this seems high. Alternatively, if we consider that only some plasmids are recombinant, the actual R would be lower.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be R = (O_B - E_B) / (O_B + E_B)\n\nAs before, which gives ~29%. But this doesn't make sense because the observed plasmids in strain B's half are significantly higher than expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the number of generations. Since each half is plated twice (plated on each lawn), the number of plasmids is roughly proportional to the number of generations.\n\nIf there's complete recombination, the number of plasmids would be minimal, but in this case, strain B's half has more plasmids, suggesting partial recombination.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is 1.5%, as it's the smallest option, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, considering the numbers, 40 on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1, which suggests that recombination occurred 10 times more in strain B's half. If strain B's half had 40 plasmids and K's had 4, the recombination frequency could be approximated as (40 - 22)/44 \u2248 0.409, or 40.9%, but this doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the number of recombinant plasmids divided by the total number of plasmids. So, in strain B's half, 40 plasmids, and total plasmids are 44, so 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which would imply a 90.9% recombination rate. But this doesn't fit the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is the proportion of recombinant plasmids in the entire population. If strain B's half had 40 and K's had 4, the total recombinant plasmids are 40, and the total plasmids are 44. So, RF = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which again doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the \"amount\" of recombination, not the percentage. The options include percentages like 0.1%, 0.2%, etc. Given that the results suggest significant recombination, but the options are in smaller percentages, perhaps the intended answer is 0.1% (option D), considering that only 4 pluses were found on K's lawn, indicating minimal recombination.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to realize that the likelihood ratio test gave a chi-square of about 4.04, which is barely above the critical value of 3.84. This suggests that the recombination frequency is around 81.8%, but none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the smallest option, 0.1%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B (2%) because the number of plasmids is low, making the recombination frequency appear lower. But I'm not certain.\n\nAfter thinking through this, I believe the most reasonable choice is option C (1.5%), as it corresponds to a lower recombination frequency, which matches the observation that strain B's half had more plasmids, suggesting that recombination occurred more frequently in that group.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli splits into two equal parts. One part is then plated on strain B's lawn, and the other on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe results show four pluses on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's. I remember that recombination refers to the interaction between two genes; if there's no recombination, the mutations don't influence each other, and their effects would be additive. If there is recombination, they interact, reducing the total effect compared to independent assortment.\n\nSo, let's think about how the results relate to recombination. In a scenario with complete recombination (no interference), the number of recombinant offspring should be around 50% of the non-recombinant ones. But here, we're dealing with a situation where both types of phages might interfere with each other, which could affect the outcome.\n\nWait, actually, since the experiment involves multiple plating stages, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me recall the basic principles. If two mutations are recombined, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is lower than expected without recombination. So, in terms of the plating results, the presence of both mutations on a bacterium would lead to more lysis, but here, the effect isn't as straightforward because some bacteria have both mutations but aren't necessarily showing the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids. After splitting, one half is plated on strain B and the other on strain K. If there's recombination, the proportion of recombinant plasmids would depend on the frequency of recombination events.\n\nLet me calculate the observed recombinant plasmid load. Since each half is plated separately, the number of recombinant plasmids in each half would depend on the overall recombination rate. However, the problem states that only strain B was affected, implying that the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, while the lysogenic phage did. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the first case, only the lysogenic phage caused issue, but in the second case, both were present, and only the lysogenic phage caused issue again?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- In the initial infection of strain B, only the lysogenic phage (which causes lysis) does anything. The lysogenic phage also carries a mutation in rII, which likely affects its ability to replicate or integrate into the genome.\n- Then, the E. coli splits, and half is plated on strain B's lawn (so the original lysogenic phage's mutation in rII may still affect this half) and the other half is plated on strain K's lawn (where the lysogenic phage's mutation in rII may not be as effective, but wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage's mutation in rII is in the phage itself, not in the host E. coli. So, when it integrates into the host, it affects replication, but the host's own mutation in rII (like a deletion or point mutation) might affect its function.\n\nBut perhaps I'm mixing up things. Let me approach this differently.\n\nIn the experiment:\n- First, all E. coli strain B are treated with two types of mutantphages: one causing lysogeny and another causing rII mutation.\n- All these phages die upon lysis, meaning only those that replicate survive.\n- The resulting colonies are split into two equal halves. One half is plated on strain B's lawn, expecting that any rII mutation would lead to more lysis, but perhaps less due to competition.\n- The other half is plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe result is four pluses on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's. This suggests that the strain K's lawn had fewer recombinant plasmids, indicating less recombination. Conversely, strain B's lawn had more recombinant plasmids, suggesting more recombination.\n\nWait, but the phages are the same except for their rII mutation. Hmm, perhaps the lysogenic phage's rII mutation in strain B affects its ability to integrate into the host, leading to more lysis. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage's rII mutation in strain K might not affect integration, so it doesn't cause as much lysis.\n\nBut according to the results, the strain B half had more plasmids (more recombinants) than strain K. That implies that the lysogenic phage from strain B has a higher recombination rate with the T_4 phage compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nWait, but both mutantphages are the same except for their rII mutation. No, wait\u2014the mutantphages are different types: one is lysogenic and causes lysis, and the other is lysogenic too but possibly with a different rII mutation? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B has a different rII mutation that makes it more efficient at integrating or replicating, leading to more lysis.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that the recombination rate affects the distribution of the mutants across the plating media.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is the percentage of gametes that are recombinant, i.e., contain both alleles from different chromosomes. It's typically measured using a test cross or a chi-square test comparing observed vs expected frequencies.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, we're dealing with a double mutant system, and the results involve the combination of two mutations. So, perhaps the recombination frequency can be inferred from the observed number of recombinant plasmids.\n\nIf there's no recombination, all plasmids would either have the lysogenic phage or the lysogenic phage plus the rII mutation, but not both. So, the expectation would be that half of the plasmids have the lysogenic phage and half have the lysogenic phage plus the rII mutation.\n\nBut in reality, the number of recombinant plasmids depends on the recombination rate. The more recombination, the more recombinant plasmids you'd expect.\n\nGiven that the strain B half had more plasmids than strain K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B had a higher recombination rate with the T_4 phage compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, perhaps the recombination frequency is related to the observed number of recombinant plasmids.\n\nIn a typical test cross, the expected recombinant count is N * (1 - R), where R is the recombination frequency. Alternatively, using a chi-square test, the expected counts can be calculated.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are on different chromosomes, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the recombination frequency.\n\nIn this case, the experiment shows that strain B's half has more plasmids than strain K's. If there were no recombination, the numbers would be similar. Any difference indicates some degree of recombination.\n\nGiven that the results are four pluses on strain K and 40 on strain B, the ratio is approximately 1:10. This suggests that the recombination event occurred once in every ten bacteria. Because the sample size is small (only a few plating events), the recombination frequency can be estimated as the reciprocal of the number of plating events per bacteria.\n\nWait, but each half is plated separately, so each half represents a generation. If the recombination happened once in every 10 bacteria, the recombination frequency would be 1/10 = 0.1, or 10%.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, 0.1 percent is option D. However, sometimes recombination frequencies are reported as percentages, so 10% would correspond to 0.1 percent when considering the entire population.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s confusing. Let me clarify: recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, representing the proportion of offspring that carry both parental chromosomes (i.e., the recombining chromosome). For example, a recombination frequency of 0.1% would mean that 0.1% of the offspring carry both parental chromosomes, but that seems very low. Alternatively, if we consider the number of recombinant plasmids, perhaps it's better to express it as a fraction.\n\nIn our case, the number of plasmids in each half is proportional to the recombination. If strain B had more plasmids, the recombination must have occurred more often in strain B's half. The observed ratio is 40 plasmids on B's half versus 4 on K's half, totaling 44 plasmids. Each plasmid represents a single mutation event.\n\nThe expected ratio under no recombination would be 1:1, giving 22 plasmids on each half. The observed ratio deviates from this, indicating some recombination. To quantify the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (Rf) = (Observed Recombinant Plasmids / Total Plasmids) * 100%\n\nBut in this case, the recombination occurs within each half, so it's a bit more complex. Alternatively, the chi-square test can determine whether the observed data fits the expected under no recombination.\n\nUsing the observed counts (O_B = 40, O_K = 4):\n\nExpected under no recombination: E_B = E_K = 22.\n\nChi-square statistic = [(40 - 22)^2 + (4 - 22)^2] / (22 + 22)\n\n= [28^2 + (-18)^2] / 44\n\n= (784 + 324) / 44\n\n= 1108 / 44 \u2248 25.18\n\nLooking up the critical value for chi-square with 1 degree of freedom at \u03b1=0.05 is about 3.84. Our chi-square is much larger, indicating significant deviation from no recombination. Thus, there must be some recombination.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can use the likelihood ratio test. The log likelihood ratio statistic is given by:\n\n2 * ln(L_observed / L_expected)\n\nWhere L_expected = (N_B! / (E_B! O_B!)) * (N_K! / (E_K! O_K!))\n\nAnd L_observed = (N_B! / (E_B! O_B!)) * (N_K! / (E_K! O_K!))\n\nSince N_B + N_K = 44, and E_B = E_K = 22,\n\nL_expected = (44)! / ((22!)^2)\n\nL_observed = (40! * 4!) / (22! * 22! )\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nL_ratio = (40! * 4!) / (44!)\n\n= (1 / (43*44)) ) * (4! / 40! )) \n\n= (1 / (43*44)) ) * (24)\n\n\u2248 24 / (1892) \u2248 0.01267\n\nln(L_ratio) \u2248 -2.02\n\nThus, \u03c7\u00b2 = 2*(-2.02) = 4.04\n\nComparing to the critical value of 3.84, we reject the null hypothesis of no recombination. Now, to find the recombination frequency, we can compute the maximum likelihood estimate.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nRF = 2 * (O_B - E_B) / (Total Plasmids)\n\n= 2*(40 - 22)/44\n\n= 2*18/44\n\n= 36/44 \u2248 0.818\n\nThis suggests an 81.8% recombination rate, which contradicts my earlier thought process. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (O_B - E_B) / (Total Plasmids)\n\nWhich would be (40 - 22)/44 = 18/44 \u2248 0.409, or 40.9%. But this doesn't align with the chi-square calculation.\n\nHmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I should look for a simpler way. Given that strain B had more plasmids, and assuming each plasmid represents a mutation, the recombination must have occurred more frequently in strain B's half.\n\nThe observed ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. Under no recombination, this would be 22:22. The difference suggests that recombination has increased the proportion in strain B's half.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, perhaps it's easier to assume that the expected number of recombinants is proportional to the difference in plating ratios.\n\nThe observed ratio is 40/(40+4)= 80%, and the expected under no recombination is 50%. Thus, the increase is 30%, which suggests that the recombination frequency is 30% of the possible recombinations. However, this approach is heuristic and might not be accurate.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRF = (O_B - E_B) / (O_B + E_B)\n\n= (40 - 22)/(40 + 22)\n\n= 18/62 \u2248 0.290, or 29%.\n\nBut this is just an approximation. Considering the options provided, none match exactly, but option C is 1.5%, which is close to 29% scaled down by a factor. However, this doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. The experiment involved two plating stages: one with strain B and one with strain K. Each half is then plated on one lawn. The result is four pluses on B's lawn and 40 on K's. This means that only 40 plasmids survived in the B half and 4 in the K half.\n\nIf there's recombination, the proportion of recombinant plasmids would depend on the recombination rate. Assuming that the recombination happens uniformly, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be proportional to the recombination frequency.\n\nGiven that strain B's half had more plasmids, the recombination must have occurred more frequently there. Let's say the recombination frequency is R. Then, the expected number of recombinant plasmids in strain B's half would be R * 44, and in strain K's half, (1-R)*44.\n\nBut the observed numbers are 40 and 4, respectively. So:\n\nR * 44 \u2248 40 => R \u2248 40/44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%\n\nBut this seems high. Alternatively, if we consider that only some plasmids are recombinant, the actual R would be lower.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be R = (O_B - E_B) / (O_B + E_B)\n\nAs before, which gives ~29%.

Alternatively, considering the numbers, 40 on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1, which suggests that recombination occurred 10 times more in strain B's half. If strain B's half had 40 plasmids and K's had 4, the recombination frequency could be approximated as (40 - 22)/44 \u2248 0.409, or 40.9%, but this doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the number of recombinant plasmids divided by the total number of plasmids. So, in strain B's half, 40 plasmids, and total plasmids are 44, so 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which would imply a 90.9% recombination rate. But this doesn't fit the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is the proportion of recombinant plasmids in the entire population. If strain B's half had 40 and K's had 4, the total recombinant plasmids are 40, and the total plasmids are 44. So, RF = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which again doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the \"amount\" of recombination, not the percentage. The options include percentages like 0.1%, 0.2%, etc. Given that the results suggest significant recombination, but the options are in smaller percentages, perhaps the intended answer is 0.1% (option D), considering that only 4 pluses were found on K's lawn, indicating minimal recombination.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, actually, no\u2014plumes usually refer to colonies, right? So maybe they're saying there are four colonies on strain K and 40 on strain B. That seems high for such a small dilution, though.\n\nWait, let me think again. If you have a population that's being plated at low concentrations, you might see more clonal plumes. So if we plate the mixture on strain B, which has mostly lysogenic phages (since only lysogenic do the damage), we should expect more plumes than if we plate on strain K, which has mostly lysogenic as well, but perhaps some lysogenic?\n\nNo, wait, actually, strain K might be resistant or have different mutation patterns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks about the recombination between the two mutations in T_4. Recombination refers to how these mutations interact\u2014like whether they occur in the same gene or different genes. Since T_4 has multiple genes, each mutation could be in a separate gene, leading to recombination.\n\nThe main point here is that if both mutations occurred in the same gene, the recombinant phage would have both mutations, causing a different type of lytic cycle. However, since only lysogenic phages cause damage, any recombination might not affect the outcome unless it introduces another mutation in the lysogenic state.\n\nBut wait, the experiment shows that when both types are present, only the lysogenic causes issues. So if a recombination happened between the two mutations, perhaps the lysogenic phage would still cause issues because it carries both mutations. No, wait, lysogenic phages don't integrate their mutations; they just copy them from the phage vector. So even if there's recombination, the lysogenic phage would still carry the mutations that cause damage.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. The number of plumes depends on the probability of recombination. If there's a lot of recombination, more plumes would form because the mutations are spreading together. Conversely, less recombination would lead to fewer plumes because the mutations stay separate.\n\nIn the scenario given, when both types are present, the division leads to two halves. One is 1:10^7 and the other 1:10^5. Plating the 1:10^7 on strain B gives four plumes, while the 1:10^5 on strain K gives 40 plumes. Wait, 40 is much higher than 4, meaning that the lower dilution (more plasmid density) is more effective at showing the pattern.\n\nThis suggests that the 1:10^7 sample was more efficient in showing the pattern, implying that the mutations were more likely to spread together. Or perhaps the presence of the higher dilution allows for better counting of plasmids, making the smaller dilution look like more plasmids, hence more plumes.\n\nSo if the higher dilution (1:10^7) resulted in fewer plumes, but the lower dilution (1:10^5) gave more, that would mean that the mutations are more likely to recombine. Because fewer plumes indicate that the mutations didn't spread as much, whereas more plumes suggest they did spread more.\n\nNow, the relationship between plume count and recombination can be modeled using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (probability of recombination)^n * total number of plasmids,\n\nwhere n is the number of times the mutation occurs in each plasmid.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, maybe we can use the ratio of plumes to infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nIf the higher dilution (1:10^7) had fewer plumes, say 4, compared to the lower dilution (1:10^5) having 40, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that recombination increased the chance of seeing more plumes, as the mutations are now linked.\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is p, the expected number of plumes would increase with higher dilutions due to the chance of recombination. The formula for the expected number of plumes (E) in a dilution D is:\n\nE = N * (p + (1-p)e^{-D})\n\nWhere N is the total number of plasmids, p is the recombination rate, and e^{-D} accounts for the probability of no recombination.\n\nBut without specific values, perhaps we can estimate the likelihood of recombination based on the observed plume counts. If the higher dilution (1:10^7) had fewer plumes, this implies that the mutations are less likely to spread, meaning there's less recombination.\n\nWait, but in our case, the higher dilution had fewer plumes, which would suggest that recombination is more likely because the mutations spread more, increasing the chance of plumes. Alternatively, if the lower dilution had more plumes, it suggests that recombination is less likely because the mutations haven't spread enough yet.\n\nGiven that the higher dilution had fewer plumes (4 vs. 40), that suggests that recombination is more likely. Therefore, the mutations must have recombined more frequently.\n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can consider the ratio of plumes. If the higher dilution (1:10^7) had fewer plumes, say 10, and the lower (1:10^5) had 40, the ratio is 4:1. This indicates that recombination increases the number of plumes, which makes sense because recombined phages would lyse the E. coli more effectively, leading to more plumes.\n\nUsing the model where the number of plumes scales with the square root of the dilution, we can estimate the recombination rate. The formula for the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(D). So if the number of plumes is reduced by a factor of 10 when going from 1:10^7 to 1:10^8, the recombination rate must be around 1/10, meaning 10% recombination. But since we're dealing with two types, the actual recombination rate per gene would be lower.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, if the higher dilution had fewer plumes, the recombination rate could be estimated as follows. Let\u2019s assume that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution. So if the plume count decreases by a factor of 10 when moving from 1:10^7 to 1:10^8, the recombination rate would be 1/sqrt(10) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%. But this seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plumes and relate it to the probability of recombination. The formula is:\n\nNumber of plumes = Total plasmids \u00d7 (Recombination rate)^2 \u00d7 ln(D)\n\nBut this is a bit complex. Instead, let's use the fact that the number of plumes increases with the square root of the dilution when recombination is occurring. So if the number of plumes is halved when moving from 1:10^7 to 1:10^8, the recombination rate is approximately 1/\u221a2 \u2248 70.7%.\n\nHowever, in our case, the number of plumes decreased from 4 to 40, which is an increase of 10-fold. That suggests that recombination is happening more often, so the recombination rate is higher than 10%, but not extremely high.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the highest option is 5%, followed by 0.05% and others. Given that the recombination is likely to be significant, but not extremely high, perhaps 2% or 0.05% is plausible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that if there's complete recombination (100%), the number of plumes would theoretically double every time the dilution increases by a factor of 10. Starting from 1:10^7 giving 4 plumes, doubling to 8 plumes would give 8 plumes when diluting to 1:10^6. But in our case, 1:10^5 gives 40 plumes, which is much higher than 8, indicating more recombination than complete.\n\nTherefore, the recombination must be somewhere between 0% and 100%, but given the options, the closest is likely 2%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal parts. One part is then diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nThe key observation here is that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, no\u2014plumes usually refer to colonies, right? So maybe they're saying there are four colonies on strain K and 40 on strain B. That seems high for such a small dilution, though.\n\nWait, let me think again. If you have a population that's being plated at low concentrations, you might see more clonal plumes. So if we plate the mixture on strain B, which has mostly lysogenic phages (since only lysogenic do the damage), we should expect more plumes than if we plate on strain K, which has mostly lysogenic as well, but perhaps some lysogenic?\n\nNo, wait, actually, strain K might be resistant or have different mutation patterns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks about the recombination between the two mutations in T_4. Recombination refers to how these mutations interact\u2014like whether they occur in the same gene or different genes. Since T_4 has multiple genes, each mutation could be in a separate gene, leading to recombination.\n\nThe main point here is that if both mutations occurred in the same gene, the recombinant phage would have both mutations, causing a different type of lytic cycle. However, since only lysogenic phages cause damage, any recombination might not affect the outcome unless it introduces another mutation in the lysogenic state.\n\nBut wait, the experiment shows that when both types are present, only the lysogenic causes issues. So if a recombination happened between the two mutations, perhaps the lysogenic phage would still cause issues because it carries both mutations. No, wait, lysogenic phages don't integrate their mutations; they just copy them from the phage vector. So even if there's recombination, the lysogenic phage would still carry the mutations that cause damage.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. The number of plumes depends on the probability of recombination. If there's a lot of recombination, more plumes would form because the mutations are spreading together. Conversely, less recombination would lead to fewer plumes because the mutations stay separate.\n\nIn the scenario given, when both types are present, the division leads to two halves. One is 1:10^7 and the other 1:10^5. Plating the 1:10^7 on strain B gives four plumes, while the 1:10^5 on strain K gives 40 plumes. Wait, 40 is much higher than 4, meaning that the lower dilution (more plasmid density) is more effective at showing the pattern.\n\nThis suggests that the 1:10^7 sample was more efficient in showing the pattern, implying that the mutations were more likely to spread together. Or perhaps the presence of the higher dilution allows for better counting of plasmids, making the smaller dilution look like more plasmids, hence more plumes.\n\nSo if the higher dilution (1:10^7) resulted in fewer plumes, but the lower dilution (1:10^5) gave more, that would mean that the mutations are more likely to recombine. Because fewer plumes indicate that the mutations didn't spread as much, whereas more plumes suggest they did spread more.\n\nNow, the relationship between plume count and recombination can be modeled using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (probability of recombination)^n * total number of plasmids,\n\nwhere n is the number of times the mutation occurs in each plasmid.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, maybe we can use the ratio of plumes to infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nIf the higher dilution (1:10^7) had fewer plumes, say 4, compared to the lower dilution (1:10^5) having 40, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that recombination increased the chance of seeing more plumes, as the mutations are now linked.\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is p, the expected number of plumes would increase with higher dilutions due to the chance of recombination. The formula for the expected number of plumes (E) in a dilution D is:\n\nE = N * (p + (1-p)e^{-D})\n\nWhere N is the total number of plasmids, p is the recombination rate, and e^{-D} accounts for the probability of no recombination.\n\nBut without specific values, perhaps we can estimate the likelihood of recombination based on the observed plume counts. If the higher dilution (1:10^7) had fewer plumes, this implies that the mutations are less likely to spread, meaning there's less recombination.\n\nWait, but in our case, the higher dilution had fewer plumes, which would suggest that recombination is more likely because the mutations spread more, increasing the chance of plumes. Alternatively, if the lower dilution had more plumes, it suggests that recombination is less likely because the mutations haven't spread enough yet.\n\nGiven that the higher dilution had fewer plumes (4 vs. 40), that suggests that recombination is more likely. Therefore, the mutations must have recombined more frequently.\n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can consider the ratio of plumes. If the higher dilution (1:10^7) had fewer plumes, say 10, and the lower (1:10^5) had 40, the ratio is 4:1. This indicates that recombination increases the number of plumes, which makes sense because recombined phages would lyse the E. coli more effectively, leading to more plumes.\n\nUsing the model where the number of plumes scales with the square root of the dilution, we can estimate the recombination rate. The formula for the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(D). So if the number of plumes is reduced by a factor of 10 when going from 1:10^7 to 1:10^8, the recombination rate must be around 1/10, meaning 10% recombination. But since we're dealing with two types, the actual recombination rate per gene would be lower.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, if the higher dilution had fewer plumes, the recombination rate could be estimated as follows. Let\u2019s assume that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution. So if the plume count decreases by a factor of 10 when moving from 1:10^7 to 1:10^8, the recombination rate would be 1/sqrt(10) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%. But this seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plumes and relate it to the probability of recombination. The formula is:\n\nNumber of plumes = Total plasmids \u00d7 (Recombination rate)^2 \u00d7 ln(D)\n\nBut this is a bit complex. Instead, let's use the fact that the number of plumes increases with the square root of the dilution when recombination is occurring. So if the number of plumes is halved when moving from 1:10^7 to 1:10^8, the recombination rate is approximately 1/\u221a2 \u2248 70.7%.\n\nHowever, in our case, the number of plumes decreased from 4 to 40, which is an increase of 10-fold. That suggests that recombination is happening more often, so the recombination rate is higher than 10%, but not extremely high.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the highest option is 5%, followed by 0.05% and others. Given that the recombination is likely to be significant, but not extremely high, perhaps 2% or 0.05% is plausible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that if there's complete recombination (100%), the number of plumes would theoretically double every time the dilution increases by a factor of 10. Starting from 1:10^7 giving 4 plumes, doubling to 8 plumes would give 8 plumes when diluting to 1:10^6. But in our case, 1:10^5 gives 40 plumes, which is much higher than 8, indicating more recombination than complete.\n\nTherefore, the recombination must be somewhere between 0% and 100%, but given the options, the closest is likely 2%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Hmm, let me double-check that.\n\nWait, the user said \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So, yes, 4 on K and 40 on B. Now, what do these numbers mean? They're showing how many times the mutation occurred in the offspring colonies. Since the cells are divided equally, if half of the initial population is used for each culture, any mutants would have a certain probability of passing their mutation to the next generation.\n\nThe experiment involves two stages of dilution. In the first stage, 1:10^7 dilution means each culture has 1/10^7 of the original sample. In the second stage, another 1:10^5 dilution happens before plating. So, overall, each culture from the first stage has been reduced by 1/10^7 * 1/10^5 = 1/10^12. That's an extremely low concentration, which suggests that any mutations must be highly specific or very rare.\n\nNow, the key here is the concept of fitness costs and how mutations affect the likelihood of replication. For the lysogenic phage to replicate, it needs to integrate its gene into the host DNA. If the integration site is changed (recombination), the lysogenic phage may fail to replicate correctly, leading to reduced fitness\u2014meaning fewer offspring survive. Conversely, if the mutation isn't integrated, the phage might replicate successfully, causing more divisions, which could lead to higher fitness.\n\nIn the experiment, since only the lysogenic phage caused division, those without the mutation (the wild type) replicated successfully, leading to a higher chance of surviving and dividing. This suggests that the mutation was necessary for successful replication. Therefore, the presence of the mutation probably reduces the fitness cost, allowing the phage to replicate better.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = sqrt(1 - q)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of the mutation (plasmid copy number), and q is the proportion of successful replication. However, since the problem states that the mutation leads to division, and the control shows only the lysogenic fission, perhaps the plasmid copy number (or recombination) is high enough that the mutation is passed along.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of pluses, if a mutation is present, the expected number of pluses should reflect the probability of the mutation being inherited. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage is dominant, so any mutation would allow it to replicate. But wait, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nLet me think again. Recombination refers to changes in the host DNA caused by integrating a foreign DNA sequence. In this scenario, if the two mutantphages cause different outcomes (lysogenic vs. non-lytic), the recombination would occur at the T_4 locus. The presence of the mutation in the lysogenic phage allows it to replicate without causing lytic fission, whereas the non-lytic phage fails to replicate, possibly due to lack of proper gene expression or integration.\n\nIf there's recombination, it means that the gene responsible for the lysogenic vs. non-lytic behavior is integrated into the host DNA. The success of this phage depends on whether the gene is properly positioned. Without recombination, the gene might disrupt the host's ability to express the protein, reducing replication efficiency.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage causes division, and the non-lytic doesn't, the recombination indicates that the gene is functional. If recombination were high, the phage would replicate more efficiently. But the data provided don't directly show the recombination rate; instead, they show the outcome of the experiment. However, the result suggests that the mutation allowed the phage to replicate, implying that the mutation is present and functional, meaning recombination occurs.\n\nBut the options given are percentages, so maybe I should calculate the recombination frequency using the observed data. Alternatively, perhaps the number of pluses reflects the probability of the mutation occurring in the daughter plasmids.\n\nSince the plate is split into two halves: half with 1:10^7 dilution (likely selection against mutations), and the other half with 1:10^5 dilution. The original population is likely much larger than either, so the dilution affects the selection pressure.\n\nThe fact that only the lysogenic phage survived suggests that the mutation allows the phage to replicate without causing issues. However, the exact calculation might involve determining the number of viable offspring per parent, which relates to the probability of the mutation being inherited.\n\nGiven that the result showed four pluses on K and 40 on B, and knowing that the lysogenic phage was only present in the B-diluted group, perhaps the presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of replication in the K-diluted group, hence resulting in more pluses.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that if there was complete recombination, the phages would behave identically, but since they didn't, some degree of recombination exists.\n\nHowever, the actual calculation for recombination frequency typically requires knowing the number of recombinant alleles. Given that the lysogenic phage didn't replicate, but the non-lytic did, the mutation must be functional, indicating that the gene is present and expressed. Therefore, the recombination frequency would indicate the extent to which the gene was integrated.\n\nBut without direct measurement, perhaps the number of pluses can help infer the recombination frequency. For example, the ratio of pluses on each plate could relate to the probability of the mutation being present.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage causes division, which implies that the mutation allows replication, suggesting that the mutation is present. Thus, the recombination frequency is high, but the options don't go beyond 0.05%.\n\nWait, looking back, the options include F (0.3%) and others. Perhaps the correct answer is D (0.05%), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the calculation might involve the number of pluses as a measure of the probability of the mutation being present in the offspring.\n\nAnother angle: the number of pluses on each plate represents the number of times the mutation occurred in the offspring. Since only the lysogenic phage caused division, the mutation must be present and functional. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high, but among the options, G (0.5%) seems too high, H (5%) also seems too high, while F (0.3%) and J (0.05%) are plausible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the expected number of pluses.

Perhaps the closest option is G (0.5%), but I'm uncertain. Alternatively, considering the experimental design, the high dilution suggests that the mutation's effect is small, implying a low recombination frequency.

The number of pluses found in each case helps determine how much of the mutations have combined.\n\nThe key here is that when you mix two different mutation types, some plasmids will carry one mutation, others the other. If all the plasmids were identical, none would cause issues. Since only some cells die, part of their DNA must be carrying one or the other mutation. Recombination refers to the chance that a plasmid has either mutation.\n\nLooking at the results: After mixing both mutant types, half the bacteria died. So 50% had one mutation and 50% the other. When these are split further\u201425% go to B and 25% to K\u2014the counts show specific numbers of pluses. In the B group, 40 pluses were found, and in K's group, 4 pluses. \n\nEach plus represents a successful replication without death. So 40 pluses mean 40 mutants that survived. Similarly, 4 pluses indicate 4 more mutants. These numbers suggest that the chance of a plasmid having either mutation is low enough to produce these outcomes probabilistically.\n\nUsing the formula for expected pluses: E = n * p * q, where n is the total number, p is the frequency of one mutation, q is the other. But since we don't know n, maybe we can compare the observed pluses to what would be expected if the mutations didn't recombine. If there was no recombination, then all plasmids would be identical, leading to zero pluses. Instead, we see 84 pluses (40+40), which suggests significant recombination.\n\nWait, actually, the presence of pluses indicates that some plasmids have at least one mutation. If the mutations are independent, the probability of a plasmid being mutated is p + q - pq. But if they're linked, the probability is lower. However, the data shows that in both groups, the pluses are higher than expected under complete independence.\n\nAlternatively, considering the initial mixing: half the bacteria died, meaning 50% have one mutation and 50% the other. Splitting them equally gives each group 25% from each mutation type. In the B group, 40 pluses mean 40 out of 25% have at least one mutation. That's 160 pluses per group? Wait, no, wait. The total number of bacteria in each group is halved, so let's say initially N bacteria. After mixing, N/2 dead, N/2 alive. Then, N/4 are plated on B and N/4 on K. \n\nIn the B group: N/4 survive and die. They're plated on B lawn. The pluses indicate successful replication, so 40 pluses means 40 successfully replicated. Similarly, in the K group, 4 pluses.\n\nAssuming each mutation has a frequency f, then the expected number of pluses would be (f*(N/4)) * (1 - f) * 2 (since both mutation types can lead to pluses). But this might complicate things.\n\nInstead, perhaps using the ratio of pluses. The B group has twice as many pluses as the K group. This implies that the chance of a plasmid having a mutation is higher in B compared to K. Since B is the original strain and may carry its own mutations, while K could also carry new ones. But the observed ratio is 40 vs. 4, suggesting a high likelihood of recombination.\n\nCalculating the exact value: The fraction of pluses in B is 40/(40+4)=86.9%. This seems very high, indicating that a large proportion of the plasmids have either mutation. If the mutations were completely independent, the expected fraction would be around 50%, but the presence of pluses suggests higher than that. However, given the numbers, it's likely that the recombination rate is quite high, possibly over 1%.\n\nBut looking at the options, the highest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Wait, 86.9% is way beyond any of those. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps the correct calculation should consider the expected number of pluses based on recombination rates.\n\nIf r is the recombination rate, then the expected number of pluses would be (p*q)*n, but since p and q are fractions of each mutation, it's more complex. Alternatively, the observed pluses suggest that the chance of a plasmid having either mutation is high, implying recombination.\n\nGiven the results, it's clear that the mutations combine significantly, leading to a high recombination rate. Among the options, F is 0.3% and G is 0.5%. Since 86.9% is much higher than these, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination is less than 1%, so option E (0.02%) or D (0.05%). Hmm, but 86% isn't close to either.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. It says the result was half the bacteria died, so 50% had one mutation, 50% the other. Then, splitting into 25% and 25% and finding 40 and 4 pluses respectively. \n\nLet\u2019s think differently: Each mutation has a frequency, say m for the first mutation and n for the second. The chance a plasmid carries either mutation is m + n - mn. But since it's recombinant, it's somewhere between m and n.\n\nIn the B group, 40 pluses represent 40 plasmids with at least one mutation. Similarly, in K's group, 4 pluses. Since B is the original strain, it's possible that some plasmids already carry mutations from B. K is a new strain; unless it's from a common ancestor, it's unrelated.\n\nSo the plasmids in the B group include both the original B strains and some from the other strain. Thus, the majority of plasmids in B have mutations, while in K, fewer do.\n\nThis suggests that a significant portion of the plasmids have mutations, implying high recombination.\n\nTo calculate recombination rate r: The formula for the expected number of plasmids with both mutations is r\u00b2*n. Here, n is the total number of plasmids. But without knowing n, it's tricky. However, the observed pluses give us information about r.\n\nSince in the B group, 40 pluses occur where 25% of the population is tested, and similarly in K. Given that 40 out of 25% plasmids in B have mutations, this suggests that the recombination rate is high.\n\nAn approximate way to estimate recombination rate r is:\n\nr \u2248 sqrt(p + q - (pluses)/total)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. Assuming p \u2248 q \u2248 0.5 (since 50% of plasmids have each mutation), then:\n\nr \u2248 sqrt(0.5 + 0.5 - 0.8) = sqrt(0.2) \u2248 0.447 or ~44.7%\n\nThat's way too high. Clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nAnother method: The expected number of plasmids with at least one mutation is approximately 2 * max(m, n). Here, m and n are the fractions of plasmids with each mutation.\n\nIn our case, in B group: 40 pluses imply that 40% of plasmids have mutations. Similarly, in K group: 4 pluses imply 10% of plasmids have mutations. Wait, but that contradicts because in K, the plasmids shouldn't have mutations from B.\n\nActually, the plasmids in B group come from both B and K. So, the plasmids with mutations are those from B and some from K. Therefore, the frequency of mutations in B is higher than in K.\n\nThus, the recombination rate r is such that:\n\nIn B group: (m + n - r) / 2 = 0.4 (since 40 out of 25% are plasmids with at least one mutation)\nIn K group: (m + n - r) / 2 = 0.08 (since 4 out of 25%)\n\nBut solving these equations leads to inconsistencies, indicating an error in assumptions.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the number of pluses relates to the square of the recombination rate. For example, if r is the recombination rate, the number of plasmids carrying both mutations is proportional to r\u00b2. \n\nGiven the high number of pluses in B, this suggests a high recombination rate. If we assume that the expected number of pluses is proportional to r\u00b2, then:\n\nNumber of pluses in B = k * r\u00b2\nSimilarly, in K = l * r\u00b2\n\nBut without knowing k and l, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, considering the relative increase in pluses in B compared to K, which is 40 vs. 4, suggesting a factor of 10 increase. This could imply that the recombination rate is high enough to make the B group have much more plasmids with mutations.\n\nAfter struggling through various approaches, I realize that the correct interpretation involves recognizing that a high number of pluses indicates a high recombination rate. Given the options, F is 0.3% and G is 0.5%. Since 86.9% of plasmids have mutations, which is way above these percentages, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination rate is less than 1%, so E (0.02%) or D (0.05%).\n\nBut 0.02% is even lower. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the actual probabilities of plasmids having mutations rather than percentages. Maybe the correct answer is that the recombination rate is around 0.05%, corresponding to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is partially lysed. Then, the remaining bacteria are placed into a lawn of strain B and another group into a lawn of strain K. The number of pluses found in each case helps determine how much of the mutations have combined.\n\nThe key here is that when you mix two different mutation types, some plasmids will carry one mutation, others the other. If all the plasmids were identical, none would cause issues. Since only some cells die, part of their DNA must be carrying one or the other mutation. Recombination refers to the chance that a plasmid has either mutation.\n\nLooking at the results: After mixing both mutant types, half the bacteria died. So 50% had one mutation and 50% the other. When these are split further\u201425% go to B and 25% to K\u2014the counts show specific numbers of pluses. In the B group, 40 pluses were found, and in K's group, 4 pluses. \n\nEach plus represents a successful replication without death. So 40 pluses mean 40 mutants that survived. Similarly, 4 pluses indicate 4 more mutants. These numbers suggest that the chance of a plasmid having either mutation is low enough to produce these outcomes probabilistically.\n\nUsing the formula for expected pluses: E = n * p * q, where n is the total number, p is the frequency of one mutation, q is the other. But since we don't know n, maybe we can compare the observed pluses to what would be expected if the mutations didn't recombine. If there was no recombination, then all plasmids would be identical, leading to zero pluses. Instead, we see 84 pluses (40+40), which suggests significant recombination.\n\nWait, actually, the presence of pluses indicates that some plasmids have at least one mutation. If the mutations are independent, the probability of a plasmid being mutated is p + q - pq. But if they're linked, the probability is lower. However, the data shows that in both groups, the pluses are higher than expected under complete independence.\n\nAlternatively, considering the initial mixing: half the bacteria died, meaning 50% have one mutation and 50% the other. Splitting them equally gives each group 25% from each mutation type. In the B group, 40 pluses mean 40 out of 25% have at least one mutation. That's 160 pluses per group? Wait, no, wait. The total number of bacteria in each group is halved, so let's say initially N bacteria. After mixing, N/2 dead, N/2 alive. Then, N/4 are plated on B and N/4 on K. \n\nIn the B group: N/4 survive and die. They're plated on B lawn. The pluses indicate successful replication, so 40 pluses means 40 successfully replicated. Similarly, in the K group, 4 pluses.\n\nAssuming each mutation has a frequency f, then the expected number of pluses would be (f*(N/4)) * (1 - f) * 2 (since both mutation types can lead to pluses). But this might complicate things.\n\nInstead, perhaps using the ratio of pluses. The B group has twice as many pluses as the K group. This implies that the chance of a plasmid having a mutation is higher in B compared to K. Since B is the original strain and may carry its own mutations, while K could also carry new ones. But the observed ratio is 40 vs. 4, suggesting a high likelihood of recombination.\n\nCalculating the exact value: The fraction of pluses in B is 40/(40+4)=86.9%. This seems very high, indicating that a large proportion of the plasmids have either mutation. If the mutations were completely independent, the expected fraction would be around 50%, but the presence of pluses suggests higher than that. However, given the numbers, it's likely that the recombination rate is quite high, possibly over 1%.\n\nBut looking at the options, the highest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Wait, 86.9% is way beyond any of those. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps the correct calculation should consider the expected number of pluses based on recombination rates.\n\nIf r is the recombination rate, then the expected number of pluses would be (p*q)*n, but since p and q are fractions of each mutation, it's more complex. Alternatively, the observed pluses suggest that the chance of a plasmid having either mutation is high, implying recombination.\n\nGiven the results, it's clear that the mutations combine significantly, leading to a high recombination rate. Among the options, F is 0.3% and G is 0.5%. Since 86.9% is much higher than these, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination is less than 1%, so option E (0.02%) or D (0.05%). Hmm, but 86% isn't close to either.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. It says the result was half the bacteria died, so 50% had one mutation, 50% the other. Then, splitting into 25% and 25% and finding 40 and 4 pluses respectively. \n\nLet\u2019s think differently: Each mutation has a frequency, say m for the first mutation and n for the second.

The second half is placed on strain K and gives 4 pluses. I'm supposed to find how much of the recombination there is between these two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the alleles from different phages are inherited together or separately.\n\nHmm, let's think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations were independent, we'd expect a certain number of recombinant plasmids. But since one mutation is lethal (lytic), it's likely that only some plasmids survive. In the first half, which is on strain B, all plasmids would be from either mutation A or B, depending on their compatibility. However, since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it might dominate, leading to more plasmids on B.\n\nWait, actually, the first half has both mutations, right? So each bacterium has two copies of the phage DNA\u2014each with its own mutation. For the lysogenic phage, the phage DNA contains a resistance gene (like rI) and a lysogenic element (like rII). The lysogenic phage carries a mutation in rII that allows it to cause lytic fission, making the phage dead. The other mutation is in the lysogenic element, which might allow for lysogeny.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage infects E. coli strain B, it integrates its DNA into the chromosome, causing disruption. Since the lysogenic phage also has a mutation in rII that makes it lytic, it will replicate inside the E. coli, lyse the cell, and release the phage back into the environment. This will kill the E. coli, hence no plasmids remain on strain B. On the other hand, if the lysogenic phage had a mutation in the host chromosome (like the RII gene), it could integrate without causing lysis, allowing it to replicate without causing death. But wait, in this case, the lysogenic phage is carrying a mutation in rII, so it should lyse, meaning no plasmids on strain B.\n\nBut in the experiment, the first half is on strain B and shows no plasmids, while the second half is on strain K and shows four plasmids. Wait, but strain K is presumably resistant to lysogeny, as lysogenic phages require the host to have the RII gene. So if strain K doesn't have the RII gene, any phages integrating into its genome wouldn't lyse. Therefore, the lysogenic phage in strain B would lyse strain B, killing it and releasing the phage DNA, which would lead to plasmid loss. On the other hand, if the lysogenic phage integrated into strain K's genome, it would replicate without lysing, keeping the plasmid. But since the lysogenic phage in strain B must have an RII gene (as per the problem statement), it would lyse, causing all plasmids to be lost. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII that allows it to lyse, so it would replicate inside E. coli and cause lytic fission, making the phage die. Therefore, any plasmid from this phage would be lost, leaving no plasmids on the E. coli. Meanwhile, if the lysogenic phage didn't have this mutation, it could integrate without causing death, and thus replicate, maintaining the plasmid.\n\nIn the experiment, the first half (strain B) has only lysogenic phages (mutated in rII and possibly another mutation in the host?), but since the lysogenic phage is lethal, the plasmids are lost. The second half (strain K) has non-lytic phages, which integrate without lysing, so the plasmids remain.\n\nNow, the experiment says that the first half is on strain B and results in 40 plasmid-free colonies. That means most of the plasmids were lost due to the lysogenic phage. The second half is on strain K, where the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so more plasmids remain.\n\nBut wait, the initial experiment shows that when both types of phages are present, the E. coli are split. Then one half is on strain B, which loses all plasmids, and the other half is on strain K, which retains some.\n\nSo, when the first half (strain B) is plated on strain B lawn, and no plasmids are found, indicating all phages were lost. When the second half (strain K) is plated on strain K, four plasmids are found. But strain K is resistant to lysogeny, so all plasmids must come from the non-lytic phages. Since the lysogenic phage requires the host to have RII gene (which strain K probably doesn't have), those plasmids don't replicate, so only the non-lytic ones are there.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage in strain B must have an RII gene, otherwise it couldn't integrate. So if strain B is resistant to lysogeny, then any phages that integrate would lyse. But the first half is on strain B, which is resistant to lysogeny, so perhaps the lysogenic phage in strain B is actually resistant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of four plasmids on strain K suggests that some of the original plasmids were retained. Since the lysogenic phage in strain B caused all plasmids to be lost, the remaining plasmids on strain K must be from the non-lytic phages.\n\nLet me think about the possible recombination events. The two mutations are in the same phage, T_4. One mutation is in the lysogenic element (e.g., rII), and the other is in the host's ability to replicate the phage (maybe via RII gene).\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations are inherited together or apart. If they are linked, only some plasmids would show the recombinant type. The number of recombinants depends on the distance between the genes on the chromosome.\n\nGiven that the experiment resulted in four plasmids on strain K and 40 on strain B, I can estimate the proportion of recombinants. Let's assume that the total number of plasmids initially is N, and the number lost on strain B is N - R, where R is the number of recombinant plasmids. Similarly, the number retained on strain K is R.\n\nFrom the experiment:\nStrain B: 40 plasmids lost => N - R = 40\nStrain K: R = 4 plasmids found\n\nTherefore, N = 40 + R = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nSo, the fraction of plasmids that are recombinants is R/N = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909 or about 9% of the plasmids are recombinants.\n\nBut wait, this seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are inversely related. Maybe the fraction of recombinants is 4/(40+4) = 4/44 \u2248 9%.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination frequency (RF) is often expressed as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes. It's calculated as (number of recombinant gametes)/(total number of gametes). In this context, the RF would represent the percentage of plasmids that are recombinant.\n\nBut sometimes RF is given as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes relative to the total. Here, the number of recombinant plasmids (R) is 4, and the total plasmids (N) is 44. So RF = (R/N)*100 = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9%. However, this isn't among the options provided, which go up to 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total number of plasmids is 44, so the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but since the answer choices are lower percentages, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation involves considering the probabilities of recombination during replication. Each time the phage replicates, there's a chance that the two mutations are inherited together or apart. The probability of recombination during replication is typically very low, around 10^-6 per replication. But over multiple generations, this can accumulate.\n\nIf we consider that the first half of the population (strain B) lost all plasmids, implying that all the phages were lost due to the lysogenic mutation. The second half (strain K) retains some plasmids, suggesting that the non-lytic phages remained intact. The difference in plasmid counts between the two halves suggests that some of the original plasmids were lost, and others remained.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\nTotal plasmids before selection: P\nNumber of plasmids lost in strain B: L\nNumber of plasmids retained in strain K: R\n\nFrom the data:\nP - L = 40 (strain B)\nR = 4 (strain K)\n\nAssuming that the total plasmids P = L + R = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nThus, L = 44 - 40 = 4 plasmids lost in strain B.\n\nThis implies that 4 plasmids were lost, meaning 4 were lost in the first half and 40 in the second. Since the lysogenic phage in strain B was responsible for the loss, these plasmids must have been from the lysogenic elements. Whereas in strain K, the lysogenic phages did not lyse, so the plasmids remained.\n\nThe number of recombinant plasmids is R = 4, and the total plasmids are P = 44. So the percentage of recombinant plasmids is (R/P)*100 = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9%, but this isn't one of the options. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship. Maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Let me think differently.\n\nEach mutation occurs at a certain rate. Let\u2019s say mutation A (lytic) happens at rate p, and mutation B (lysogenic) at rate q. The recombination frequency would relate to how often the two mutations are inherited together or apart. The number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the product of the allele frequencies. If both mutations are rare, the recombination frequency is approximately pq.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rates, this approach might not work. Instead, looking back at the initial assumption, the percentage of recombinant plasmids being 9% doesn\u2019t match any of the options. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate based on the ratio of plasmids lost versus retained.\n\nThe loss in strain B is 40, retention in strain K is 4. The total plasmids are 44, so 4 are recombinants. Thus, the fraction of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, which is still not an option. Maybe the question expects us to consider the ratio of the plasmids retained to the total, which would be 4/44 \u2248 9%, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is calculated differently.\n\nWait, maybe the percentage is based on the fact that the loss in strain B is 40, which represents 40/44 of the plasmids lost, and the retention is 4/44. But that doesn't make sense because the retention comes from the lysogenic phage in strain K, which didn't lyse, so it retains all the plasmids from that source.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the percentage of recombinant plasmids is equal to the number of plasmids retained on strain K divided by the total plasmids, which is 4/44 \u2248 9%. But since the options don't include 9%, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the numbers. The first half (strain B) lost 40 plasmids, and the second half (strain K) retained 4. Total plasmids would be 44. So the fraction of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%. None of the options match this exactly, so perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAnother angle: If the loss in strain B is 40, and the retention in strain K is 4, then the total plasmids are 44. The number of recombinant plasmids is 4, so the percentage would be (4/44)*100 \u2248 9%, but again, this isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different interpretation, such as the percentage of plasmids that were recombinant compared to the total.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of recombinant plasmids is equal to the number of plasmids from the non-lytic phage in strain K, which is 4. The total plasmids are 44, so the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but this still doesn't align with the options.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is H (5%). Perhaps the intended answer is 0.05%, which is 0.05/100 = 0.0005. But why would that be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for the percentage of recombinant plasmids:\n\nPercentage = (R / P) * 100\n\nWhere R is the number of recombinant plasmids, and P is the total number of plasmids.\n\nHere, R = 4, P = 44, so 4/44 \u2248 9%, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the experiment measures the number of plasmids lost in each half. The first half (strain B) loses 40, and the second half (strain K) retains 4. So the total plasmids are 44. The number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total is 44. So the percentage is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on the fact that the loss in strain B is 40, which is three times the retention in strain K (4). So the ratio is 40:4, simplifying to 10:1. Therefore, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 1/(10+1) \u2248 9%, but again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The number of recombinant plasmids is the number that are present in both strain B and K. Wait, no, that's not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the ratio of plasmid loss to plasmid retention. Strain B loses 40, strain K retains 4. So the ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the loss is ten times the retention, which might indicate a certain genetic distance. The percentage of recombination would then correspond to this ratio.\n\nUsing genetic mapping formulas, the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is calculated as the observed ratio minus the expected ratio. If COI is greater than 1, it indicates positive interference, meaning fewer recombinations than expected. The COI formula is:\n\nCOI = (Observed / Expected) - 1\n\nIn this case, Observed is 40/4 = 10, and Expected is 1, so COI = 10 - 1 = 9. This indicates strong positive interference, meaning the two mutations are tightly linked.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence relates to the map unit distance between the two mutations. The formula is:\n\nCOI = (1/distance_in_map_units + 1)/expected\n\nFor perfect linkage, COI = 1, and for maximum interference, COI approaches infinity. The exact relationship is a bit complex, but the approximate formula can be used.\n\nGiven that COI = 9, which is extremely high, indicating that the two mutations are nearly tightly linked. The percentage of recombination can be approximated using the formula:\n\n% Recombination \u2248 (1 - (1/distance_in_map_units))\n\nBut without the exact distance, it's difficult to compute directly. Alternatively, the percentage can be estimated based on the observed COI.\n\nAlternatively, using the approximation that when COI is large (greater than 1), the percentage of recombinants is approximately (COI)/(COI + 1) * 100. So (9)/(10) * 100 = 90%. But this is even higher than our previous calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe problem states that upon splitting the E. coli strain B into two halves, one half is treated with a lawn of strain B and results in 40 plasmid-free colonies. The other half is treated with a lawn of strain K and results in 4 plasmids. We need to determine the recombination frequency between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination frequency is typically measured as the percentage of offspring that are recombinant. In this context, it's the percentage of plasmids that are from the recombinant genotype.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage in strain B must have disrupted the plasmids, all plasmids from strain B lose function. From strain K, the lysogenic phage doesn't disrupt, so all plasmids from strain K are retained. The number of plasmids lost in strain B is 40, and retained in strain K is 4.\n\nTotal plasmids initially are 44 (40 lost + 4 retained). The number of recombinant plasmids is 4 (from strain K, as they weren't lost in strain B). Therefore, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, which isn't an option. The closest option is F (0.3%), but that's too low.\n\nWait, perhaps the error lies in assuming that all plasmids from strain B were lost. Maybe the lysogenic phage in strain B doesn't necessarily disrupt all plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of plasmids in strain B is due to the lysogenic phage, which may not affect all",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains are split into two equal halves.\n\nThe first half is then placed on a lawn of E. coli strain B and results in 40 plasmid-free colonies. The second half is placed on strain K and gives 4 pluses. I'm supposed to find how much of the recombination there is between these two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the alleles from different phages are inherited together or separately.\n\nHmm, let's think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations were independent, we'd expect a certain number of recombinant plasmids. But since one mutation is lethal (lytic), it's likely that only some plasmids survive. In the first half, which is on strain B, all plasmids would be from either mutation A or B, depending on their compatibility. However, since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it might dominate, leading to more plasmids on B.\n\nWait, actually, the first half has both mutations, right? So each bacterium has two copies of the phage DNA\u2014each with its own mutation. For the lysogenic phage, the phage DNA contains a resistance gene (like rI) and a lysogenic element (like rII). The lysogenic phage carries a mutation in rII that allows it to cause lytic fission, making the phage dead. The other mutation is in the lysogenic element, which might allow for lysogeny.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage infects E. coli strain B, it integrates its DNA into the chromosome, causing disruption. Since the lysogenic phage also has a mutation in rII that makes it lytic, it will replicate inside the E. coli, lyse the cell, and release the phage back into the environment. This will kill the E. coli, hence no plasmids remain on strain B. On the other hand, if the lysogenic phage had a mutation in the host chromosome (like the RII gene), it could integrate without causing lysis, allowing it to replicate without causing death. But wait, in this case, the lysogenic phage is carrying a mutation in rII, so it should lyse, meaning no plasmids on strain B.\n\nBut in the experiment, the first half is on strain B and shows no plasmids, while the second half is on strain K and shows four plasmids. Wait, but strain K is presumably resistant to lysogeny, as lysogenic phages require the host to have the RII gene. So if strain K doesn't have the RII gene, any phages integrating into its genome wouldn't lyse. Therefore, the lysogenic phage in strain B would lyse strain B, killing it and releasing the phage DNA, which would lead to plasmid loss. On the other hand, if the lysogenic phage integrated into strain K's genome, it would replicate without lysing, keeping the plasmid. But since the lysogenic phage in strain B must have an RII gene (as per the problem statement), it would lyse, causing all plasmids to be lost. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII that allows it to lyse, so it would replicate inside E. coli and cause lytic fission, making the phage die. Therefore, any plasmid from this phage would be lost, leaving no plasmids on the E. coli. Meanwhile, if the lysogenic phage didn't have this mutation, it could integrate without causing death, and thus replicate, maintaining the plasmid.\n\nIn the experiment, the first half (strain B) has only lysogenic phages (mutated in rII and possibly another mutation in the host?), but since the lysogenic phage is lethal, the plasmids are lost. The second half (strain K) has non-lytic phages, which integrate without lysing, so the plasmids remain.\n\nNow, the experiment says that the first half is on strain B and results in 40 plasmid-free colonies. That means most of the plasmids were lost due to the lysogenic phage. The second half is on strain K, where the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so more plasmids remain.\n\nBut wait, the initial experiment shows that when both types of phages are present, the E. coli are split. Then one half is on strain B, which loses all plasmids, and the other half is on strain K, which retains some.\n\nSo, when the first half (strain B) is plated on strain B lawn, and no plasmids are found, indicating all phages were lost. When the second half (strain K) is plated on strain K, four plasmids are found. But strain K is resistant to lysogeny, so all plasmids must come from the non-lytic phages. Since the lysogenic phage requires the host to have RII gene (which strain K probably doesn't have), those plasmids don't replicate, so only the non-lytic ones are there.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage in strain B must have an RII gene, otherwise it couldn't integrate. So if strain B is resistant to lysogeny, then any phages that integrate would lyse. But the first half is on strain B, which is resistant to lysogeny, so perhaps the lysogenic phage in strain B is actually resistant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of four plasmids on strain K suggests that some of the original plasmids were retained. Since the lysogenic phage in strain B caused all plasmids to be lost, the remaining plasmids on strain K must be from the non-lytic phages.\n\nLet me think about the possible recombination events. The two mutations are in the same phage, T_4. One mutation is in the lysogenic element (e.g., rII), and the other is in the host's ability to replicate the phage (maybe via RII gene).\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations are inherited together or apart. If they are linked, only some plasmids would show the recombinant type. The number of recombinants depends on the distance between the genes on the chromosome.\n\nGiven that the experiment resulted in four plasmids on strain K and 40 on strain B, I can estimate the proportion of recombinants. Let's assume that the total number of plasmids initially is N, and the number lost on strain B is N - R, where R is the number of recombinant plasmids. Similarly, the number retained on strain K is R.\n\nFrom the experiment:\nStrain B: 40 plasmids lost => N - R = 40\nStrain K: R = 4 plasmids found\n\nTherefore, N = 40 + R = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nSo, the fraction of plasmids that are recombinants is R/N = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909 or about 9% of the plasmids are recombinants.\n\nBut wait, this seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are inversely related. Maybe the fraction of recombinants is 4/(40+4) = 4/44 \u2248 9%.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination frequency (RF) is often expressed as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes. It's calculated as (number of recombinant gametes)/(total number of gametes). In this context, the RF would represent the percentage of plasmids that are recombinant.\n\nBut sometimes RF is given as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes relative to the total. Here, the number of recombinant plasmids (R) is 4, and the total plasmids (N) is 44. So RF = (R/N)*100 = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9%. However, this isn't among the options provided, which go up to 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total number of plasmids is 44, so the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but since the answer choices are lower percentages, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation involves considering the probabilities of recombination during replication. Each time the phage replicates, there's a chance that the two mutations are inherited together or apart. The probability of recombination during replication is typically very low, around 10^-6 per replication. But over multiple generations, this can accumulate.\n\nIf we consider that the first half of the population (strain B) lost all plasmids, implying that all the phages were lost due to the lysogenic mutation. The second half (strain K) retains some plasmids, suggesting that the non-lytic phages remained intact. The difference in plasmid counts between the two halves suggests that some of the original plasmids were lost, and others remained.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\nTotal plasmids before selection: P\nNumber of plasmids lost in strain B: L\nNumber of plasmids retained in strain K: R\n\nFrom the data:\nP - L = 40 (strain B)\nR = 4 (strain K)\n\nAssuming that the total plasmids P = L + R = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nThus, L = 44 - 40 = 4 plasmids lost in strain B.\n\nThis implies that 4 plasmids were lost, meaning 4 were lost in the first half and 40 in the second. Since the lysogenic phage in strain B was responsible for the loss, these plasmids must have been from the lysogenic elements. Whereas in strain K, the lysogenic phages did not lyse, so the plasmids remained.\n\nThe number of recombinant plasmids is R = 4, and the total plasmids are P = 44. So the percentage of recombinant plasmids is (R/P)*100 = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9%, but this isn't one of the options. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship. Maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Let me think differently.\n\nEach mutation occurs at a certain rate. Let\u2019s say mutation A (lytic) happens at rate p, and mutation B (lysogenic) at rate q. The recombination frequency would relate to how often the two mutations are inherited together or apart. The number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the product of the allele frequencies. If both mutations are rare, the recombination frequency is approximately pq.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rates, this approach might not work. Instead, looking back at the initial assumption, the percentage of recombinant plasmids being 9% doesn\u2019t match any of the options. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate based on the ratio of plasmids lost versus retained.\n\nThe loss in strain B is 40, retention in strain K is 4. The total plasmids are 44, so 4 are recombinants. Thus, the fraction of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, which is still not an option. Maybe the question expects us to consider the ratio of the plasmids retained to the total, which would be 4/44 \u2248 9%, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is calculated differently.\n\nWait, maybe the percentage is based on the fact that the loss in strain B is 40, which represents 40/44 of the plasmids lost, and the retention is 4/44. But that doesn't make sense because the retention comes from the lysogenic phage in strain K, which didn't lyse, so it retains all the plasmids from that source.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the percentage of recombinant plasmids is equal to the number of plasmids retained on strain K divided by the total plasmids, which is 4/44 \u2248 9%. But since the options don't include 9%, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the numbers. The first half (strain B) lost 40 plasmids, and the second half (strain K) retained 4. Total plasmids would be 44. So the fraction of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%. None of the options match this exactly, so perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAnother angle: If the loss in strain B is 40, and the retention in strain K is 4, then the total plasmids are 44. The number of recombinant plasmids is 4, so the percentage would be (4/44)*100 \u2248 9%, but again, this isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different interpretation, such as the percentage of plasmids that were recombinant compared to the total.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of recombinant plasmids is equal to the number of plasmids from the non-lytic phage in strain K, which is 4. The total plasmids are 44, so the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but this still doesn't align with the options.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is H (5%). Perhaps the intended answer is 0.05%, which is 0.05/100 = 0.0005. But why would that be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for the percentage of recombinant plasmids:\n\nPercentage = (R / P) * 100\n\nWhere R is the number of recombinant plasmids, and P is the total number of plasmids.\n\nHere, R = 4, P = 44, so 4/44 \u2248 9%, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the experiment measures the number of plasmids lost in each half. The first half (strain B) loses 40, and the second half (strain K) retains 4. So the total plasmids are 44. The number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total is 44. So the percentage is 4/44 \u2248 9%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on the fact that the loss in strain B is 40, which is three times the retention in strain K (4). So the ratio is 40:4, simplifying to 10:1. Therefore, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 1/(10+1) \u2248 9%, but again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The number of recombinant plasmids is the number that are present in both strain B and K. Wait, no, that's not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the ratio of plasmid loss to plasmid retention. Strain B loses 40, strain K retains 4. So the ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the loss is ten times the retention, which might indicate a certain genetic distance. The percentage of recombination would then correspond to this ratio.\n\nUsing genetic mapping formulas, the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is calculated as the observed ratio minus the expected ratio. If COI is greater than 1, it indicates positive interference, meaning fewer recombinations than expected. The COI formula is:\n\nCOI = (Observed / Expected) - 1\n\nIn this case, Observed is 40/4 = 10, and Expected is 1, so COI = 10 - 1 = 9. This indicates strong positive interference, meaning the two mutations are tightly linked.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence relates to the map unit distance between the two mutations. The formula is:\n\nCOI = (1/distance_in_map_units + 1)/expected\n\nFor perfect linkage, COI = 1, and for maximum interference, COI approaches infinity. The exact relationship is a bit complex, but the approximate formula can be used.\n\nGiven that COI = 9, which is extremely high, indicating that the two mutations are nearly tightly linked. The percentage of recombination can be approximated using the formula:\n\n% Recombination \u2248 (1 - (1/distance_in_map_units))\n\nBut without the exact distance, it's difficult to compute directly. Alternatively, the percentage can be estimated based on the observed COI.\n\nAlternatively, using the approximation that when COI is large (greater than 1), the percentage of recombinants is approximately (COI)/(COI + 1) * 100. So (9)/(10) * 100 = 90%. But this is even higher than our previous calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe problem states that upon splitting the E. coli strain B into two halves, one half is treated with a lawn of strain B and results in 40 plasmid-free colonies. The other half is treated with a lawn of strain K and results in 4 plasmids.

The closest option is F (0.3%), but that's too low.\n\nWait, perhaps the error lies in assuming that all plasmids from strain B were lost. Maybe the lysogenic phage in strain B doesn't necessarily disrupt all plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of plasmids in strain B is due to the lysogenic phage, which may not affect all",

In these experiments, four pluses were found on K and 40 on B.\n\nHmm, let's think about what each condition means. Dilution affects how many viable phages there are. If you dilute too much, you might lose all phages. Here, the first half was diluted 1:10^7, which is quite low, so maybe most phages are lost or dead. But since some phages survived, perhaps the initial number isn't too high. Then, when plated on B, it's still divided into two, so each contains half of the original population. Similarly, the second half was diluted less, making more phages available for K.\n\nWait, but why did only the lysogenic phage cause division? Oh, right, because the lysogenic phages don't lyse the cell\u2014they stay inside and replicate. So if both types are present, only the lysogenic ones would cause the issue. That explains why only the lysogenic phage caused the division.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment: After infection, the bacteria divide into two groups. One group has a higher chance of lysing, meaning more lysogenic phages. Because when you dilute the phages too much, their numbers drop below detectable levels, leading to fewer lysis events. Wait no, actually, if the phage concentration is too high, even small concentrations can lead to more lysis. Or maybe the opposite\u2014too few phages mean no lysis.\n\nBut wait, the experiment says that only the lysogenic phage caused the split, while the wild-type phage didn't. So in the first dilution (1:10^7), the lysogenic phages should have been diluted enough that some could survive and cause the split. But when the phages are more concentrated, more of them die. However, in this case, after dilution, only the lysogenic phage caused the split, meaning that when the concentration is lower than the threshold where all phages die, some remain. But wait, if the lysogenic phage is the only one causing the problem, then the others shouldn't be.\n\nLet me think again. When you dilute the phages, if the concentration is high enough that even a little bit of phage leads to lysis, then you'll see the effect. But if the concentration is too high, everything dies, and you get no divisions. So in the first dilution (1:10^7), the lysogenic phage was present. If the concentration is such that even a tiny fraction survives, it would cause the split. But if the concentration is too high, nothing survives, and no split occurs. Since the split happened, the concentration must have been sufficient to allow some phages to live long enough to lyse the cells.\n\nThen, the next step is diluting 1:10^5. This further reduces the concentration, making it harder for phages to survive. Now, when you plate on strain K, the number of lysogenic phages should be higher because they're less likely to die due to dilution. However, in reality, we saw 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. Wait, no, because the B half was plated on B, so any lysogenic phages from the first group would have replicated and led to division. Whereas the K half was plated on a strain that doesn't take up lysogenic phages as efficiently, so only the wild-type phages (which are non-lytic) would cause division.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach it differently. The key here is determining the likelihood that a mutation confers the ability to cause division, given the presence of another mutation.\n\nThe formula to calculate recombination frequency is 1 - (1 - r)^n, where n is the number of independent loci involved. But I'm not sure if that applies here directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the expected number of plasmid replication events. Each time a phage replicates, it takes up DNA from the host. If multiple phages are present, they can cause replication events. The probability that a certain number of plasmid replication events occur depends on the number of phages and their concentrations.\n\nIn the first experiment, the lysogenic phage caused the split. The second experiment shows that when the phages are more concentrated (diluted 1:10^5), only the non-lytic phage (wild type) allows replication, while the lysogenic one dies.\n\nSo the recombination frequency is determined by whether the two mutations interfere during replication. If they do, the number of plasmid replication events would be reduced because some phages would interfere with each other.\n\nIn the first scenario, when phages are dilute (1:10^7), the number of plasmid replication events is high, allowing more splits. When phages are concentrated (1:10^5), the interference occurs, reducing the number of replication events, thus fewer splits.\n\nThe number of plasmid replication events can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of plasmid replication events = r * N * D,\n\nwhere r is the recombination frequency, N is the number of phages, and D is the dilution factor.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula here. Alternatively, the expected number of plasmid replication events (let's call it Y) can be estimated by:\n\nY = (r) * (N * D),\n\nwhere N is the number of phages, D is the dilution factor, and r is the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the two mutations interfere, the effective number of replication events would be lower.

The probability that a certain number of plasmid replication events occur depends on the number of phages and their concentrations.\n\nIn the first experiment, the lysogenic phage caused the split. The second experiment shows that when the phages are more concentrated (diluted 1:10^5), only the non-lytic phage (wild type) allows replication, while the lysogenic one dies.\n\nSo the recombination frequency is determined by whether the two mutations interfere during replication. If they do, the number of plasmid replication events would be reduced because some phages would interfere with each other.\n\nIn the first scenario, when phages are dilute (1:10^7), the number of plasmid replication events is high, allowing more splits. When phages are concentrated (1:10^5), the interference occurs, reducing the number of replication events, thus fewer splits.\n\nThe number of plasmid replication events can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of plasmid replication events = r * N * D,\n\nwhere r is the recombination frequency, N is the number of phages, and D is the dilution factor.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula here. Alternatively, the expected number of plasmid replication events (let's call it Y) can be estimated by:\n\nY = (r) * (N * D),\n\nwhere N is the number of phages, D is the dilution factor, and r is the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the two mutations interfere, the effective number of replication events would be lower. Let's assume that in the first case, with D=1:10^7, we had Y1 replication events, and in the second case, Y2.\n\nGiven that in the first case, the lysogenic phage caused division, implying that Y1 > Y0 (original number), and in the second case, Y2 </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto E. coli strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto strain K. After incubation, there are 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nSo, let's break this down. First, in the double infection scenario, the two halves have different dilutions. The first half has a very high dilution (1:10^7), meaning fewer cells survive. The second half is much less dilute (1:10^5), which means more cells survive. Since the phages cause different outcomes depending on their mutation, these two groups should show different numbers of successful infections.\n\nIn the first group (1:10^7), because the cells aren't highly diluted, the lysogenic phage might replicate enough to lyse some of them, right? So if the lysogenic phage isn't effective here due to the low concentration, maybe the lysogenic phage can still lyse some cells or just die. Wait, no, because the lysogenic phage typically doesn't lyse; it just integrates and lives for a long time. So perhaps in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage can replicate enough to cause lytic fission, leading to cell death. That would explain why there are fewer pluses on B in this group because the lysogenic phage can lyse cells even in a high-dilution environment.\n\nIn the low dilution group (1:10^5), the cells are much more concentrated, so the lysogenic phage must be more effective. It can replicate enough to induce lysis, leading to many pluses on strain B. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage might replicate too much, causing issues beyond its intended effect, possibly causing lysogenesis in strain K. Wait, no, lysogenesis usually refers to integrating into the host's DNA, which can lead to more instability. So in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage may lyse cells (pluses on B), while in the low dilution group, the lysogenic phage could integrate and cause issues in strain K.\n\nNow, looking at the data: 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. So the low dilution group (1:10^5) shows more pluses on B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is effective there, probably inducing lysis. In contrast, the high dilution group (1:10^7) shows fewer pluses on B, indicating that the lysogenic phage isn't effectively causing lysis here\u2014maybe it dies instead, or the cell count is too low to see significant replication.\n\nThe difference in the number of pluses suggests that the two mutations have some interaction. If the two mutations were independent, we'd expect a certain proportion of pluses in both groups. However, since there are fewer pluses in the high dilution group, it implies that the lysogenic phage is more likely to replicate in the high-dilution condition, causing more lysis. This suggests that the two mutations interact, increasing the probability of lysogenesis in the presence of the other mutation. This kind of interaction is called recombination.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we consider how often the two mutations work together. Each mutation alone has a certain rate of causing lysogenesis. Let\u2019s say the lysogenic phage has a mutation that works with another mutation in T_4 to increase the likelihood of lysis. If in the high dilution group, the combined effect leads to more lysis than either mutation alone, it indicates recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = probability of lysogenic phage inducing lysogenesis without recombination.\n- q = probability of the other mutation causing lysogenesis without recombination.\n\nWith recombination, the probability becomes p*q + r, where r is the recombination frequency (as a fraction).\n\nBut from the experiment, in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage induces lysogenesis (plus), whereas in the low dilution group, it doesn't. So:\n\np (without recombination) = number of pluses / total cells in high dilution group.\nSimilarly, q (without recombination) = number of pluses / total cells in low dilution group.\n\nWait, but in the high dilution group, the cells are few, so the plus rate reflects the actual probability. Similarly, in the low dilution group, the plus rate reflects the probability in that condition.\n\nAssuming that the number of pluses in each group corresponds directly to the probabilities, let's compute p and q.\n\nIn the high dilution group (1:10^7):\nTotal cells = let's assume N.\nNumber of pluses = 40 - 4 = 36 (assuming 4 failed).\nWait, actually, the problem says 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. So the high dilution group (1:10^7) has 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. But wait, the total number of cells in each group depends on the dilution.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution group (1:10^7) is more dilute, so the number of cells is higher. If there are 4 pluses, that means 4 out of X cells are pluses, where X is the number of cells in that group.\n\nSimilarly, in the low dilution group (1:10^5), 40 pluses mean 40 out of Y cells are pluses.\n\nAssuming that the total number of cells in the high dilution group is significantly larger than those in the low dilution group, because of the high dilution factor (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), the number of pluses per cell decreases as dilution increases.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s assume that in the high dilution group, the number of pluses is P_high = 40 (on B) and K_high = 4 (on K). But wait, the problem states that half is plated on B and half on K. So each half has 40 pluses on B and 40 on K?\n\nNo, the problem says four pluses on K and 40 on B. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nAh, okay, so each half is a separate sample. One half is 1:10^7 dilution on B, giving 40 pluses on B. The other half is 1:10^5 dilution on K, giving 4 pluses on K.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the initial population is split equally, each half represents half the original culture. So in the 1:10^7 group, you plate on B, expecting to get about 40 pluses, and in the 1:10^5 group, you plate on K, expecting 4 pluses.\n\nBut the observed counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems inverted. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So the high dilution group (1:10^7) was plated on B, giving 40 pluses. The low dilution group (1:10^5) was plated on K, giving 4 pluses. That seems correct.\n\nSo, in the high dilution group (1:10^7), B was plated, and 40 pluses occurred. In the low dilution group (1:10^5), K was plated, and 4 pluses occurred.\n\nThis suggests that the high dilution group had a lower chance of lysogenesis because the cells were fewer, allowing more pluses. The low dilution group had a higher chance because cells were more abundant, making it easier for the lysogenic phage to lyse.\n\nIf the two mutations were independent, we\u2019d expect a similar number of pluses in both groups. But here, the high dilution group shows more pluses on B, and the low dilution group shows fewer pluses on B, and more pluses on K.\n\nWait, no, in the high dilution group, B is plated, and 40 pluses occur. In the low dilution group, K is plated, and 4 pluses occur. So in the high dilution group, lysogenic phage causes lysogenesis (40 pluses on B), and in the low dilution group, lysogenic phage does not cause lysogenesis (only 4 pluses on K).\n\nBut the lysogenic phage should generally cause lysogenesis in both groups unless it's interacting with another mutation. So if the two mutations interact, we'd expect a higher proportion of lysogenesis in the high dilution group compared to the low dilution group.\n\nIn our case, the high dilution group shows higher lysogenesis (40 pluses on B) compared to the low dilution group (4 pluses on K). This suggests an interaction between the two mutations, i.e., recombination.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Frequency of Recombination in High Dilution Group - Frequency in Low Dilution Group) / Maximum Frequency\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI):\n\nCOI = (Observed Frequency in High Dilution Group) / (Expected Frequency in High Dilution Group)\n\nWhere Expected Frequency in High Dilution Group is (Probability of Lysogenesis in High Dilution Group)^2 * Total Cells.\n\nBut I think a simpler approach is to consider the ratio of pluses between the two groups to estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nGiven that in the high dilution group, lysogenic phage induces lysogenesis (40 pluses on B), and in the low dilution group, it doesn't (4 pluses on K), we can infer that the two mutations interact.\n\nThe formula for COI is:\n\nCOI = (Observed Recombination Frequency in High Dilution Group) / (Expected Recombination Frequency)\n\nWhich is:\n\nCOI = (40 / 400) / (4 / 400) ) = 1/1 = 1\n\nWait, but COI is usually expressed as Observed / Expected.

If no recombination, some might survive. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant offspring is N = (1 - r) * n * p, where:\n- N is the number of plumes,\n- r is the recombination frequency (as a fraction),\n- n is the total number of phages,\n- p is the probability of each mutation.\n\nWait, actually, I think the exact formula depends on whether the mutations are recessive or dominant. Since phages usually have dominant characters, let's assume that if either mutation occurs, the phage survives. So the survival rate is 1 - r, where r is the recombination rate.\n\nIn this case, when only lysogenic phages are used, all bacteria should be resistant because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse them. That means no plumes grow. However, when both types are present, some resistance should survive depending on the recombination.\n\nLooking at the data, on strain B's lawn, 4 plumes grew from the first half. On strain K's lawn, 40 plumes grew from the second half. Wait, but why is there such a large difference? Maybe the initial dilution affects the growth rates. Also, since the phages are present in different concentrations (halves), perhaps the dilution affects the number of viable phages.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The total number of phages in each half is halved, so each has twice as many. When testing against strain K, which carries one mutation, the presence of the lysogenic phage (from strain B) could cause more resistance than just the lysogenic phage alone.\n\nBut maybe I'm complicating it. Instead, consider the ratio of plumes. On B's lawn, 4 plumes; on K's, 40. Since the phages are present in different concentrations, the number of plumes should be proportional to their numbers. So, the ratio of plumes is about 1:10, meaning the concentration of phages in the K sample was 1/10th of B's.\n\nNow, considering the two mutations, the chance that a phage carrying neither mutation survives is (1 - r)^2. The chance it carries one mutation is 2*(1 - r)*r, and the chance it carries both is r^2. But wait, that's for recessive traits. Alternatively, if the mutations are dominant, the chance that a phage carries at least one mutation is 1 - r.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another angle. The expected number of plumes on strain K's lawn should reflect the combination of the two mutations. If there's perfect recombination (r=0), then every phage would carry both mutations, so none would survive, leading to zero plumes. But here, we see 40 plumes, which isn't zero, so there must be some recombination.\n\nGiven that, let's use the formula for the expected number of plumes on strain K's lawn. The formula is:\n\nN_K = (1 - r)^2 * C_B,\n\nwhere C_B is the concentration of phages on strain B's lawn. Similarly, on strain K's lawn:\n\nN_K = (1 - r)^2 * C_K,\n\nassuming the same conditions.\n\nBut wait, the actual number observed is 40 on K and 4 on B. This suggests that the ratio of N_K on K's lawn to N_B on B's lawn is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. Therefore:\n\n(1 - r)^2 / 1 = 10,\n\nso (1 - r)^2 = 10,\n\nTaking square roots, 1 - r \u2248 sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16,\n\nSo r \u2248 1 - 3.16 \u2248 negative, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes indicates the relationship between the concentrations. Since the concentration on K's lawn is higher (because the phages were diluted more), the likelihood of surviving increases. The expected number of plumes on K's lawn should be higher due to both mutations.\n\nIf there's complete recombination (r=1), then all phages carry both mutations, so no plumes.

Then, these halves are plated on different bacterial strains\u2014B and K\u2014and the number of pluses found tells us about the mutations.\n\nThe experiment involves four phases:\n1. Infection of strain B by both mutant phages.\n2. Resulting division is split into two equal parts.\n3. One part is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B.\n4. The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\n5. After incubation, four pluses are found on K and 40 on B.\n\nNow, I remember that the recombination frequency (RF) is calculated using the formula RF = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring). So first, I need to find how many of the total plasmid copies were correctly transmitted from the parent phages and how many were recombinant.\n\nIn the initial infection, each phage has its own copy of the T_4 genome. For the lysogenic phage, the entire T_4 copy is present. For the lytic phage, only part of the T_4 is present. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate the T_4 mutation, any new T_4 copies would be from the lysogenic phage's endogenous DNA, which is wild-type.\n\nWhen the E. coli is plated on strain B, only those that received the lysogenic phage will have the mutation. Similarly, if they received the lytic phage, they won't have the mutation. However, since both phages are present, some E. coli might have a mix of their T_4 copies, leading to some with correct and some without.\n\nAfter splitting into two halves, one is used for B (wild-type) and the other for K (mutated). The plating shows that four on K and 40 on B indicate that the K strain (with mutation) produced more recombinant offspring than the B strain did. Wait, no\u2014it should be the other way around because the K strain is supposed to have the mutation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's think again. The lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination because it integrates into the host T_4. The lytic phage carries the T_4 into the phage, so when the phage replicates, the T_4 copy comes from the phage itself, not the host. So the presence or absence of the T_4 mutation depends on whether the phage was lysogenic or lytic.\n\nSo in the initial infection, some E. coli cells will have the lysogenic phage (and thus the mutation), others will have the lytic phage (no mutation). When you plate them on strain B, only the ones with the lysogenic phage will show the effect. If you plate them on strain K, only those with the lysogenic phage will do so. But wait, the problem says that when both phages are present, some bacteria get lysed. So perhaps the combination leads to some with both phages, causing some cells to lose the T_4 mutation?\n\nNo, actually, in the initial case, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination; it just inserts its T_4 into the phage. The lytic phage does cause recombination? Or not necessarily. Wait, the lytic phage typically causes recombination because it takes up the T_4 and then divides, transferring the T_4 back into the phage. So the presence of both phages could lead to some cells having the T_4 mutated from the lytic phage and some having it from the lysogenic.\n\nBut in the initial test, when only lysogenic phages are present, all the E. coli plates grow except those that lost the mutation. Similarly, when only lytic phages are present, all grow except those losing the mutation. But when both are present, some cells may have both phages, resulting in some carrying the T_4 from both, leading to possible recombinant offspring.\n\nWait, but in reality, the lysogenic phage doesn't carry the T_4, so any T_4 copies in the daughter cells come from the phage. The lytic phage, however, does carry the T_4. So when the lysogenic phage replicates, the T_4 comes from the phage. When the lytic phage replicates, the T_4 comes from the phage.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate on the host T_4. It just integrates its T_4 into the phage. So when the lysogenic phage replicates, the T_4 copy comes from the phage itself. Therefore, the lysogenic phage cannot contribute a T_4 mutation to the daughter cell. The lytic phage, on the other hand, does replicate and transfers its T_4 into the daughter phage, thereby giving the daughter a T_4 mutation.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage in the media ensures that any daughter cell that took up the phage will have a T_4 mutation, while the lytic phage will give pure T_4.\n\nSo when both phages are present, the daughter cells will have either lysogenic (T_4 mutation) or lytic (pure T_4). However, the problem states that when both are present, the E. coli is lysed into half, meaning that some cells took up both phages and hence had T_4 from both. But wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, so taking both phages would mean the daughter cell took the lysogenic T_4 once and the lytic T_4 again, which isn't possible because the T_4 is integrated into the phage. So actually, the daughter cell can only take one T_4 copy from the phage. If the phage is lysogenic, it gives T_4 from the phage. If it's lytic, it also gives T_4 from the phage. Wait, that can't happen because the T_4 is carried into the phage. So any daughter cell that has taken up the phage will have T_4 from the phage. But the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, so it must have been inserted into the phage.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. The experiment shows that when both phages are present, the daughter cells are split into two groups. One group is plated on strain B (which expects the mutation), and the other on strain K (which shouldn't have the mutation). The counts are 4 on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, no. Because when both phages are present, some E. coli might have both phages, meaning they took the lysogenic T_4 from one and the lytic T_4 from another. But the T_4 is integrated into the phage, so if the phage is lysogenic, it inserts T_4 from the phage. If it's lytic, it takes the T_4 from the phage as well. Wait, that can't be right because the T_4 is already inside the phage. So actually, every time a phage replicates, it adds its T_4 copy into the phage, regardless of whether it's lysogenic or lytic.\n\nWait, no. For lysogenic phages, they don't replicate on the host T_4. They just insert their T_4 into the phage. So when the lysogenic phage replicates, it uses the same T_4 copy as before, inserting it into the new phage. Thus, the daughter phage will have T_4 from the original phage.\n\nFor lytic phages, they replicate and transfer their T_4 to the daughter phage, so the daughter phage has T_4 from the lytic phage.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So when you have both phages, the daughter phage will have T_4 from either the lysogenic or the lytic phage, depending on which phage replicated. Therefore, some daughter phages will have T_4 from the lysogenic (so mutation) and some from the lytic (no mutation).\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination, right? It just inserts its T_4 into the phage. So any daughter phage that took up a lysogenic phage will have the T_4 from the lysogenic phage, meaning they'll have the mutation. Phages that took up lytic phages will have the T_4 from the lytic phage, which is wild-type.\n\nTherefore, when you plate these on strain B, which expects the mutation, the daughter cells that took up the lysogenic phage will show the mutation (pluses), while those that took up the lytic phage won't. Similarly, when you plate on strain K, which doesn't expect the mutation, only the ones that took up the lysogenic phage will show the mutation.\n\nBut according to the experiment, four of the 40 on K showed plus, meaning that 4/40 = 1/10 of the cells took up the lysogenic phage. Similarly, four of 40 on B showed plus, meaning 4/40 = 1/10 as well. Wait, but that suggests that the same proportion of cells took up the lysogenic phage in both cases, which seems odd because the presence of both phages should affect the distribution differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me clarify:\n\n- When both phages are present, the daughter phage will have T_4 from either lysogenic or lytic, depending on which phage replicated.\n\n- So some cells will have T_4 from lysogenic (mutation), others from lytic (no mutation).\n\nBut the experiment shows that when both are present, 4 on K and 40 on B are positive. That implies that 4/40 = 1/10 of the cells took up the lysogenic phage, and 4/40 = 1/10 also on B. Wait, but why would the same proportion apply to both strains? That doesn't make sense unless there's something else at play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to interference in the replication, leading to some cells being more likely to take up the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when both are present, the daughter cells are split into two equal parts, one is plated on B and one on K. The numbers are 4 and 40 respectively.\n\nHmm, maybe the initial split is such that some cells have both phages, leading to more cells taking up the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, the presence of both phages affects the distribution differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in calculating the recombination frequency. The formula is RF = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total). The number of recombinant offspring is the difference between the expected and observed.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the recombination occurs when a cell takes up both phages, but since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, perhaps the cells that take up the lysogenic phage are more likely to have the mutation.\n\nBut given that the experiment resulted in 4 pluses on K and 40 on B, which is a ratio of 1:10, suggesting that 10% of the cells took up the lysogenic phage. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, these cells would show the mutation on both B and K, but the counts differ. On B, 4 pluses are found among 40, and on K, 40 pluses are found among 40. Wait, that doesn't add up because 4 + 40 = 44, which is less than 80.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbers. If the total number of offspring is 80, then 4 on B and 40 on K means 4 + 40 = 44, leaving 36 unaccounted. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split is such that one half is plated on B and the other on K, each with 10^7 dilution, and then each is plated on strain B and K respectively. But that still doesn't resolve the discrepancy in counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when both phages are present, the daughter cells have T_4 from either lysogenic or lytic. The lysogenic phage insertion doesn't produce recombinant offspring because the T_4 is already integrated. So the presence of the lysogenic phage would prevent recombination, whereas the lytic phage would allow for recombination.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that when both are present, some cells take up both phages, leading to possible recombination. But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, any T_4 copy in the daughter cell comes from the phage, so there wouldn't be any recombination.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall the formula. The recombination frequency (RF) is the percentage of times the two phages have recombined. It can be calculated using the equation:\n\nRF = [ (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring) ] * 100%\n\nIf we consider that when the lysogenic phage is present, the cells lose T_4, and when the lytic phage is present, they gain T_4, the RF would correspond to the number of times the two phages have combined their T_4 copies.\n\nBut in this case, since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, any T_4 in the daughter cell comes from the phage itself. Therefore, if a cell took up the lysogenic phage, it would have the mutation, and if it took up the lytic phage, it wouldn't.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that some cells took up both phages, which would imply that they took up the lysogenic (mutation) and the lytic (no mutation). But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, that's impossible. Therefore, the presence of both phages in a cell would mean that the T_4 came from one phage or the other, but not both. Hence, no recombination occurred.\n\nBut the counts suggest that some cells took up both phages, leading to some showing the mutation on both strains. But that contradicts the fact that the T_4 is carried by the phage. So perhaps the actual scenario is that the presence of both phages allows for some cells to have T_4 from both, but since the T_4 is integrated into the phage, it's impossible for a daughter cell to have T_4 from both phages. Therefore, there's no recombination, and the RF is zero.\n\nBut the options include small percentages like 0.1%, 0.02%, etc., so maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the assumption is that the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to some cells gaining T_4 from it, while the lytic phage leads to others gaining it. But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, any T_4 in the daughter cell comes from the phage itself, making recombination impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phages can integrate their T_4 into themselves, and the presence of both phages leads to some cells combining their T_4 copies, but that's unlikely. Therefore, the RF should be zero, but none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The formula for RF is RF = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total). In this case, the number of recombinant offspring would be the number of cells that took up both phages, but since T_4 is carried by the phage, there's no recombination. Therefore, RF is zero.\n\nBut looking at the options, F is 0.3%. None of the options is zero, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, another angle: when both phages are present, the daughter cells can receive T_4 from either lysogenic or lytic. The lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, so any T_4 in the daughter cell comes from the phage. The lytic phage does carry T_4, so any daughter cell receiving the lytic phage would have T_4 from it. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage prevents recombination, while the lytic phage allows it.\n\nGiven that, when both phages are present, the daughter cells would mostly have T_4 from the lytic phage, except for a small fraction that took up both phages, which would have T_4 from lysogenic (mutation) and lytic (no mutation). But since T_4 is carried by the phage, the daughter cell can't have both. Therefore, the only possibility is that the cell took up the lysogenic phage and the lytic phage, which is impossible due to the T_4 integration. Hence, recombination never happened, RF=0%.\n\nBut the options don't include zero. This suggests that my interpretation is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the key is that when both phages are present, the daughter cells may have T_4 from both, leading to some cells having the mutation. But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, any daughter cell that took up the lysogenic phage would have the mutation, and those that took up the lytic phage would not. Therefore, the number of pluses on B would be those that took up the lysogenic phage, and those on K would be the same.\n\nBut in the experiment, four on B and 40 on K showed pluses, which is a 1:10 ratio. So if 4 out of 40 on K showed pluses, that suggests that 10% of the cells took up the lysogenic phage. But since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, these cells would have the mutation on both B and K. However, the counts on B are lower, which suggests that only a subset took up the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to interference in the replication, making it more likely for the lysogenic phage to replicate, thus increasing the number of cells that took up the lysogenic phage. This would increase the RF.\n\nLet me calculate the recombination frequency using the numbers provided. If the RF is x%, then the number of recombinant offspring would be (x/100)*80 \u2248 0.8x. The observed recombinant count is 4 on B and 40 on K, totaling 44, but that's inconsistent because the total number of offspring should be 80.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the plating on B and K affected the outcome. When plated on B, only half survives (plated on B with 1:10^7 dilution), and when plated on K, the same.\n\nWait, I'm getting too confused. Let me look at the answer choices.

The lytic phage carries the T_4 into the phage, so when the phage replicates, the T_4 copy comes from the phage itself, not the host. So the presence or absence of the T_4 mutation depends on whether the phage was lysogenic or lytic.\n\nSo in the initial infection, some E. coli cells will have the lysogenic phage (and thus the mutation), others will have the lytic phage (no mutation). When you plate them on strain B, only the ones with the lysogenic phage will show the effect. If you plate them on strain K, only those with the lysogenic phage will do so. But wait, the problem says that when both phages are present, some bacteria get lysed. So perhaps the combination leads to some with both phages, causing some cells to lose the T_4 mutation?\n\nNo, actually, in the initial case, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination; it just inserts its T_4 into the phage. The lytic phage does cause recombination? Or not necessarily. Wait, the lytic phage typically causes recombination because it takes up the T_4 and then divides, transferring the T_4 back into the phage. So the presence of both phages could lead to some cells having the T_4 mutated from the lytic phage and some having it from the lysogenic.\n\nBut in the initial test, when only lysogenic phages are present, all the E. coli plates grow except those that lost the mutation. Similarly, when only lytic phages are present, all grow except those losing the mutation. But when both are present, some cells may have both phages, resulting in some carrying the T_4 from both, leading to possible recombinant offspring.\n\nWait, but in reality, the lysogenic phage doesn't carry the T_4, so any T_4 copies in the daughter cells come from the phage. The lytic phage, however, does carry the T_4. So when the lysogenic phage replicates, the T_4 comes from the phage. When the lytic phage replicates, the T_4 comes from the phage.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate on the host T_4. It just integrates its T_4 into the phage. So when the lysogenic phage replicates, the T_4 copy comes from the phage itself. Therefore, the lysogenic phage cannot contribute a T_4 mutation to the daughter cell. The lytic phage, on the other hand, does replicate and transfers its T_4 into the daughter phage, thereby giving the daughter a T_4 mutation.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage in the media ensures that any daughter cell that took up the phage will have a T_4 mutation, while the lytic phage will give pure T_4.\n\nSo when both phages are present, the daughter cells will have either lysogenic (T_4 mutation) or lytic (pure T_4). However, the problem states that when both are present, the E. coli is lysed into half, meaning that some cells took up both phages and hence had T_4 from both. But wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, so taking both phages would mean the daughter cell took the lysogenic T_4 once and the lytic T_4 again, which isn't possible because the T_4 is integrated into the phage. So actually, the daughter cell can only take one T_4 copy from the phage. If the phage is lysogenic, it gives T_4 from the phage. If it's lytic, it also gives T_4 from the phage. Wait, that can't happen because the T_4 is carried into the phage. So any daughter cell that has taken up the phage will have T_4 from the phage. But the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, so it must have been inserted into the phage.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. The experiment shows that when both phages are present, the daughter cells are split into two groups. One group is plated on strain B (which expects the mutation), and the other on strain K (which shouldn't have the mutation). The counts are 4 on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, no. Because when both phages are present, some E. coli might have both phages, meaning they took the lysogenic T_4 from one and the lytic T_4 from another. But the T_4 is integrated into the phage, so if the phage is lysogenic, it inserts T_4 from the phage. If it's lytic, it takes the T_4 from the phage as well. Wait, that can't be right because the T_4 is already inside the phage. So actually, every time a phage replicates, it adds its T_4 copy into the phage, regardless of whether it's lysogenic or lytic.\n\nWait, no. For lysogenic phages, they don't replicate on the host T_4. They just insert their T_4 into the phage. So when the lysogenic phage replicates, it uses the same T_4 copy as before, inserting it into the new phage. Thus, the daughter phage will have T_4 from the original phage.\n\nFor lytic phages, they replicate and transfer their T_4 to the daughter phage, so the daughter phage has T_4 from the lytic phage.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So when you have both phages, the daughter phage will have T_4 from either the lysogenic or the lytic phage, depending on which phage replicated. Therefore, some daughter phages will have T_4 from the lysogenic (so mutation) and some from the lytic (no mutation).\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination, right? It just inserts its T_4 into the phage. So any daughter phage that took up a lysogenic phage will have the T_4 from the lysogenic phage, meaning they'll have the mutation. Phages that took up lytic phages will have the T_4 from the lytic phage, which is wild-type.\n\nTherefore, when you plate these on strain B, which expects the mutation, the daughter cells that took up the lysogenic phage will show the mutation (pluses), while those that took up the lytic phage won't. Similarly, when you plate on strain K, which doesn't expect the mutation, only the ones that took up the lysogenic phage will show the mutation.\n\nBut according to the experiment, four of the 40 on K showed plus, meaning that 4/40 = 1/10 of the cells took up the lysogenic phage. Similarly, four of 40 on B showed plus, meaning 4/40 = 1/10 as well. Wait, but that suggests that the same proportion of cells took up the lysogenic phage in both cases, which seems odd because the presence of both phages should affect the distribution differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me clarify:\n\n- When both phages are present, the daughter phage will have T_4 from either lysogenic or lytic, depending on which phage replicated.\n\n- So some cells will have T_4 from lysogenic (mutation), others from lytic (no mutation).\n\nBut the experiment shows that when both are present, 4 on K and 40 on B are positive. That implies that 4/40 = 1/10 of the cells took up the lysogenic phage, and 4/40 = 1/10 also on B. Wait, but why would the same proportion apply to both strains? That doesn't make sense unless there's something else at play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to interference in the replication, leading to some cells being more likely to take up the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when both are present, the daughter cells are split into two equal parts, one is plated on B and one on K. The numbers are 4 and 40 respectively.\n\nHmm, maybe the initial split is such that some cells have both phages, leading to more cells taking up the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, the presence of both phages affects the distribution differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in calculating the recombination frequency. The formula is RF = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total). The number of recombinant offspring is the difference between the expected and observed.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the recombination occurs when a cell takes up both phages, but since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, perhaps the cells that take up the lysogenic phage are more likely to have the mutation.\n\nBut given that the experiment resulted in 4 pluses on K and 40 on B, which is a ratio of 1:10, suggesting that 10% of the cells took up the lysogenic phage. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, these cells would show the mutation on both B and K, but the counts differ. On B, 4 pluses are found among 40, and on K, 40 pluses are found among 40. Wait, that doesn't add up because 4 + 40 = 44, which is less than 80.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbers. If the total number of offspring is 80, then 4 on B and 40 on K means 4 + 40 = 44, leaving 36 unaccounted. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split is such that one half is plated on B and the other on K, each with 10^7 dilution, and then each is plated on strain B and K respectively. But that still doesn't resolve the discrepancy in counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when both phages are present, the daughter cells have T_4 from either lysogenic or lytic. The lysogenic phage insertion doesn't produce recombinant offspring because the T_4 is already integrated. So the presence of the lysogenic phage would prevent recombination, whereas the lytic phage would allow for recombination.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that when both are present, some cells take up both phages, leading to possible recombination. But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, any T_4 copy in the daughter cell comes from the phage, so there wouldn't be any recombination.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall the formula. The recombination frequency (RF) is the percentage of times the two phages have recombined. It can be calculated using the equation:\n\nRF = [ (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring) ] * 100%\n\nIf we consider that when the lysogenic phage is present, the cells lose T_4, and when the lytic phage is present, they gain T_4, the RF would correspond to the number of times the two phages have combined their T_4 copies.\n\nBut in this case, since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, any T_4 in the daughter cell comes from the phage itself. Therefore, if a cell took up the lysogenic phage, it would have the mutation, and if it took up the lytic phage, it wouldn't.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that some cells took up both phages, which would imply that they took up the lysogenic (mutation) and the lytic (no mutation). But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, that's impossible. Therefore, the presence of both phages in a cell would mean that the T_4 came from one phage or the other, but not both. Hence, no recombination occurred.\n\nBut the counts suggest that some cells took up both phages, leading to some showing the mutation on both strains. But that contradicts the fact that the T_4 is carried by the phage. So perhaps the actual scenario is that the presence of both phages allows for some cells to have T_4 from both, but since the T_4 is integrated into the phage, it's impossible for a daughter cell to have T_4 from both phages. Therefore, there's no recombination, and the RF is zero.\n\nBut the options include small percentages like 0.1%, 0.02%, etc., so maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the assumption is that the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to some cells gaining T_4 from it, while the lytic phage leads to others gaining it. But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, any T_4 in the daughter cell comes from the phage itself, making recombination impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phages can integrate their T_4 into themselves, and the presence of both phages leads to some cells combining their T_4 copies, but that's unlikely. Therefore, the RF should be zero, but none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The formula for RF is RF = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total). In this case, the number of recombinant offspring would be the number of cells that took up both phages, but since T_4 is carried by the phage, there's no recombination. Therefore, RF is zero.\n\nBut looking at the options, F is 0.3%. None of the options is zero, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, another angle: when both phages are present, the daughter cells can receive T_4 from either lysogenic or lytic. The lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, so any T_4 in the daughter cell comes from the phage. The lytic phage does carry T_4, so any daughter cell receiving the lytic phage would have T_4 from it. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage prevents recombination, while the lytic phage allows it.\n\nGiven that, when both phages are present, the daughter cells would mostly have T_4 from the lytic phage, except for a small fraction that took up both phages, which would have T_4 from lysogenic (mutation) and lytic (no mutation). But since T_4 is carried by the phage, the daughter cell can't have both. Therefore, the only possibility is that the cell took up the lysogenic phage and the lytic phage, which is impossible due to the T_4 integration. Hence, recombination never happened, RF=0%.\n\nBut the options don't include zero. This suggests that my interpretation is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the key is that when both phages are present, the daughter cells may have T_4 from both, leading to some cells having the mutation. But since the T_4 is carried by the phage, any daughter cell that took up the lysogenic phage would have the mutation, and those that took up the lytic phage would not. Therefore, the number of pluses on B would be those that took up the lysogenic phage, and those on K would be the same.\n\nBut in the experiment, four on B and 40 on K showed pluses, which is a 1:10 ratio. So if 4 out of 40 on K showed pluses, that suggests that 10% of the cells took up the lysogenic phage. But since the lysogenic phage doesn't carry T_4, these cells would have the mutation on both B and K. However, the counts on B are lower, which suggests that only a subset took up the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to interference in the replication, making it more likely for the lysogenic phage to replicate, thus increasing the number of cells that took up the lysogenic phage. This would increase the RF.\n\nLet me calculate the recombination frequency using the numbers provided. If the RF is x%, then the number of recombinant offspring would be (x/100)*80 \u2248 0.8x. The observed recombinant count is 4 on B and 40 on K, totaling 44, but that's inconsistent because the total number of offspring should be 80.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the plating on B and K affected the outcome. When plated on B, only half survives (plated on B with 1:10^7 dilution), and when plated on K, the same.\n\nWait, I'm getting too confused. Let me look at the answer choices. They're all small percentages,",

From what I remember, if a mutation confers resistance, more colonies would form because the phage isn't lysing the bacteria. Here, the lysogenic phage should be resistant to both strains, while the lytic phage shouldn't be resistant to either since it can cause cell lysis.\n\nSo, looking at the concentrations:\n- Dilution 1:10^7 means the colony count is high because the phage is not killing the bacteria.\n- Dilution 1:10^5 means fewer colonies because some phages might have killed the bacteria.\n\nIn the experiment, the lysogenic phage should produce more colonies than the lytic one because it doesn't die. However, the presence of multiple mutants complicates things. The fact that half the population has lysogenic phages and the other half has lytic ones affects the expected outcomes.\n\nThe plateau method suggests that the mutation responsible for resistance (lysogenic phage) is downstream in the gene order. So, the lysogenic phage carries its own mutation before any other genes. The recombination refers to how these mutations are arranged within the gene order.\n\nNow, the key part is determining the number of recombinants. Recombination occurs when two mutations are placed near each other in the gene order. Each additional recombination increases the likelihood of resistance formation because the double mutant would carry both mutations, making it harder for other phages to disrupt the cells.\n\nGiven the dilution factors, we can calculate the probability of each mutation occurring. For the lysogenic phage to produce enough colonies at 1:10^7 dilution, it must have a high level of expression. Similarly, the lytic phage needing to survive at 1:10^5 dilution implies a strong selection against it.\n\nThe observed difference in colony counts (4 vs. 40) indicates that the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive and reproduce than the lytic one. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a better chance of being expressed, meaning there's a recombination event favoring the lysogenic type.\n\nTo find the exact percentage, I think about the formula involving dilution factors and the expected outcomes.

If we assume that the mutation responsible for resistance is at a certain position, we can model the expected results.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the frequency of the lysogenic mutation as 'p' and the recombination fraction as 'r'. The expected number of resistant colonies would be proportional to p*(1 - r). Similarly, the non-resistant would be q*(1 + r), where q = 1 - p.\n\nGiven the dilutions, we can estimate p from the higher dilution (1:10^7) where colonies are more abundant.

Recombination would mean that the two mutations interfere with each other. If there's a lot of recombination, more cells might have both mutations, which could lead to more resistant bacteria.

This implies that the two mutations are almost completely independent, as the lytic phage affected the replication rate significantly, making fewer cells survive to form colonies.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombinant frequency? Recombination frequency usually refers to the proportion of recombinant offspring, not the actual number of recombinants. Since the problem states \"amount of recombination,\" I think we're looking for the percentage of cells that exhibit both mutations.\n\nIf the observed outcome shows that 4 out of 44 cells had both mutations, then the recombination frequency would be (4/44)*100 \u2248 9.09%. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the ratio of the dilutions. The B plate was diluted 1:10^7, and the K plate 1:10^5. The ratio is 10^7 : 10^5 = 100:1, indicating that the effect of the lytic phage was much stronger on the B side.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of recombinants is inversely proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. If the recombination frequency (RF) is r, then the probability of having both mutations is r. The RF can also be approximated by the ratio of the number of recombinant cells to the total number of cells minus the recombinant cells. \n\nIn this case, if the number of recombinant cells is 4 and the total is 44, then RF = (4)/(44 - 4) = 4/40 = 10%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, if RF is calculated as (number of recombinants)/(total), which would be 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, still not matching any given choice.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the lytic phage affects replication rates, reducing the likelihood of both mutations occurring together. If the recombination frequency is low, like less than 0.5%, then the number of recombinant cells would be small compared to the total.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. If the RF is around 0.05%, that would mean 4/(44 - 4) \u2248 9.09%, which contradicts. Alternatively, maybe the RF is 0.05%, meaning 4 = 0.05% of 44 \u2192 4 = 0.05*44=2.2 \u2192 No, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinants) / (total - number of recombinants). So 4/(44-4)=4/40=10%, which again doesn't match any option. Maybe I'm missing something fundamental.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula RF = (number of recombinant cells) / (total cells). Here, the total cells are 40 + 4 = 44. So RF = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. None of the options are close to this. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the setup.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of the dilutions is 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5, so the effect is 100x stronger. This suggests a high degree of recombination, but the options don't include such high percentages.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. On the B plate, 4 plumes; on the K plate, 40. Total is 44. So 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, but the closest option is G (0.5%) and H (5%). That doesn't align. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nAnother angle: If the lysogenic phage didn't cause division, but the lytic phage did, then cells without lysogenic phage replicate normally, but cells with lysogenic phage die quickly. So, the plasmid-free cells replicate normally, while plasmid-bearing cells are killed. Thus, the number of plasmids per cell is lower in the B plate compared to the K plate. This indicates that the presence of lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of recombination.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is R, then the ratio of plasmids per cell would be (1 - R)/(1 - 2R). But this seems too complex. Alternatively, since the lysogenic phage reduces the number of recombinant cells, the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant cells is 1:10. This suggests that the effect is significant, implying a high recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the options, the highest is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Since 4/44 is approximately 9.09%, which is much higher than these values, I must have misapplied the concept.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinant cells) / (total cells - number of recombinant cells). So 4/(44 - 4) = 4/40 = 10%. Still not matching any option.\n\nMaybe the answer is based on the fact that the lytic phage caused the reduction in plasmid number, implying a certain degree of recombination. If the ratio of plasmids is 1:10, then the recombination frequency is 1 - (log(10)/log(2))^{-1} \u2248 0.16%, which rounds to 0.16%. Option I is 0.02%, II is 0.05%. Closest is I (0.02%), but 0.16% isn't listed. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is RF = (number of recombinant cells) / (total cells) * 100. So 4/44 * 100 \u2248 9.09%. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach is different.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to use the ratio of the dilutions. The B plate was treated with 1:10^7, and the K plate with 1:10^5. The ratio is 10^7:10^5 = 100:1, meaning the effect of the lytic phage was 100 times stronger on the B side. This indicates a high level of interference, suggesting a high degree of recombination.\n\nIf recombination frequency is high, say 1%, then RF = 1%. Then the number of recombinant cells would be 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which matches the ratio of effects. So the recombination frequency would be approximately 1%, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier I thought 10% wasn't an option, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate RF based on the ratio of dilutions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal parts. One part is then dilated at a higher concentration (1:10^7) and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. The other part is dilated at a lower concentration (1:10^5) and plated on strain K's lawn, giving 4 plumes.\n\nHmm, I think this has to do with recombinant phages causing double resistance. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interfere with each other. If there's a lot of recombination, more cells might have both mutations, which could lead to more resistant bacteria. In the experiment, since the lysogenic phage alone caused division, the presence of the lytic phage must be interfering somehow.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination percentage is (number of recombinant individuals / total population) * 100. So here, the number of recombinants is 4, and the total is 40 + 4 = 44? Wait, no, actually, the total is split into two plates: 40 on B and 4 on K. Maybe the total is 40 + 4 = 44? Or perhaps it's considering all the possible combinations, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the expected outcomes if there was complete independence. If the two events were independent, the probability of both happening would be p1*p2. But in reality, some cells might have either mutation or both, leading to different outcomes.\n\nIn the first plate, only the lysogenic phage worked, so those cells died and didn't contribute to the colonies. The remaining cells, where the lytic phage didn't affect them, replicated normally. But wait, in the second plate, the lysogenic phage didn't work, so those cells died, while the ones without lysogenic phage replicated normally. However, the phage did affect replication rates differently, meaning some cells with lysogenic phage died faster than others.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the ratio of plumes. On the B plate, 4 plumes, and on the K plate, 40. The ratio is 1:10, which suggests that the presence of the lytic phage reduced the number of recombinants by a factor of 10.

For E. coli, when you plate on strain B, any additional plasmids come from the lysogenic phage. When you plate on strain K, additional plasmids come from the recombined phages.

Since it's a single mutation each, maybe n=1.\n\nBut let me think again. Each mutation contributes independently, so the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to the product of their concentrations. However, in this case, the plasmids from each type are being plated separately, so the ratio would directly relate to recombination.\n\nIf there's no recombination, all plasmids would be from B, so the ratio would be 1.

That would be 1-1=0, which isn't right. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids on K to B is 40/4 =10, so the log base e of 10 is about 2.3.

That probably indicates that the lysogenic phage didn't work for some of the cells, leaving fewer cells where the lysogenic phage caused issues. Similarly, when it was plated on strain K, four plumes appeared, suggesting the lysogenic phage worked better for strain K compared to the first half.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The initial population is split into two halves. One half has more cells due to dilution (diluted 1:10^7), so the number of cells per plume increases. When plated on strain B, four plumes appear, indicating that the lysogenic phage did something bad in four of those cells. When the same half is plated on strain K, four plumes are also seen, which could mean that some cells allowed the lysogenic phage to replicate without causing issues.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage's effect is dependent on the host strain. It works better against one strain and worse against another. This dependency is indicative of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination reduces the probability that two mutations will interfere. Each mutation can lead to a certain degree of interference. The maximum interference is when a mutation leads to full interference, i.e., the mutated cell cannot take up the phage again, so the next phage must be entirely new. Interference decreases as the sequence becomes more similar.\n\nThe formula for expected plasmid density after multiple generations is P = p * e^{-n(p-1)}, where p is the fraction of cells with the mutation, n is the number of generations, and e is the base of natural logarithms.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to use the observed plume counts to estimate the interference. Since the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain K, but worked better on strain B, there's an interaction. The recombination rate R can be estimated using the equation:\n\nR = ln(1 - p)/ln(1 - q)\n\nwhere p is the fraction of cells expressing the first mutation (lytic phage) and q is the fraction of cells expressing the second mutation (lysogenic phage).\n\nAlternatively, since only some cells express both mutations, we can calculate the frequency of each mutation and their combination.\n\nLet me denote:\n- F = frequency of lysogenic phage (only affects strain B)\n- L = frequency of lysogenic phage (interacts with lysogenic phage on strain B?)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the probabilities. Suppose the probability that a cell expresses lysogenic phage is p, and the probability that a cell expresses the lysogenic phage from the other mutation is q. The expected number of plasmids per cell would then depend on these probabilities.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the probability of both mutations occurring in a cell is pq. If they're recombined, this probability decreases because the sequence is now more similar.\n\nFrom the data given, when only lysogenic phage is present, it affects strain B but not K. So, the lysogenic phage doesn't interfere with K. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have some recombination with itself within the T4 genome.\n\nSimilarly, when both are present, the lysogenic phage affects some cells but not others. So, the presence of both mutations causes partial interference.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency (RF), we can use the formula:\n\nRF = [P(pq)] / [p + q - pq]\n\nWhere P(pq) is the observed plume count.\n\nWait, actually, the RF can be calculated using the ratio of plumes. Since the lysogenic phage affected strain B but not K, the difference in plume density corresponds to the degree of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to assume that the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present is proportional to the product of their frequencies.

One half is dilated by a factor of 1:10^7, meaning each replicate has about 10 million fewer bacteria. Plated on strain B, four plaques are found. On strain K, four were also found. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Hmm, maybe I misread that. It says that after being infected, the E. coli from the plates was split into two equal parts. Then one part was placed on strain B and the other on strain K. So each strain gets half the number of colonies.\n\nBut then each of those plating batches was further diluted by factors of 10^7 and 10^5 respectively. That means the actual numbers would be even lower, right? Because dilution affects the count.\n\nSo if we consider the initial population of E. coli, let's say there are N bacteria. After dilution by 1:10^7, each culture has N / 1e7 bacteria. Similarly for 1:10^5, it's N / 1e5. \n\nWhen you plate them on E. coli strain B or K, the chance of a mutation causing lysis depends on the number of phages. If both mutants are present, each phage has a certain probability of carrying each mutation. But since only lysogenic phages cause death, the presence of any lysogenic phage would kill the E. coli.\n\nWait, actually, no\u2014when multiple phages are present, if any die, the cells might survive. Or do all the phages have to carry both mutations for any cell to survive? No, that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the experiment measures whether at least one phage carries a mutation, leading to lysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the experiment counts how many cells survive after the phage infection. If a lysogenic phage is present, the cell dies; otherwise, it survives. Since there are two types of phages, the total number of cells that survive is the ones where neither phage carries the mutation. Wait, no\u2014since only the lysogenic phage can cause death, so any cell with a lysogenic phage will die. So survival requires that none of the phages cause death, i.e., no lysogenic phages or no lysogenic phages and no lysogenic phages again?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Suppose that when you plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause death. So cells that were infected with lysogenic phages die, while those with wild-type phages live. Therefore, the number of surviving cells on strain B should correspond to the proportion of cells without lysogenic phages, plus any cells with lysogenic phages that don't die due to another mutation. But in this case, only lysogenic phages cause death, so only cells without any lysogenic phages would survive. So the number of survivors on strain B would depend on the frequency of lysogenic phages and their ability to cause death.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, only lysogenic phages cause death, but if both mutations are present, cells could die either because of lysogenic or wild-type phages. Wait, no\u2014if both types are present, but only lysogenic phages cause death. So cells with lysogenic phages die, regardless of their type. Cells with wild-type phages may survive if no lysogenic phages are present. But in the experiment, both types are present, so some cells might have one mutation and die, and others might have none and survive.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should model the probabilities. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- P(l) = probability that a randomly selected bacterium has a mutation in the lysogenic phage.\n- P(w) = probability that it has the wild-type phage.\n\nAssuming independence, the probability that a bacterium survives (i.e., neither lysogenic nor wild-type phages cause death) is (1 - P(l)) * (1 - P(w)).\n\nIf the phages are independent, then the expected number of survivors per culture would be N * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w)). But in reality, the experiment observed specific numbers, so I can use that to calculate the frequencies.\n\nGiven that after dilution, the number of survivors on each plate is known. For example, on strain B, four plumes were found. Each plume corresponds to a batch of cells. The dilution factors mean each batch has fewer cells. So the number of plasmids on each plate is proportional to the dilution factor times the original number of bacteria.\n\nLet me assume that the initial number of E. coli is N. After dilution by 1:1e7, each plume has N / 1e7 cells. Similarly, dilution by 1:1e5 gives N / 1e5.\n\nEach plume represents a culture. The number of successful infections (survivors) would be the number of plasmids that did not cause death. Assuming that the lysogenic phages cause death, so any plasmid with a lysogenic phage kills the cell. Wild-type phages allow survival.\n\nTherefore, the number of survivors on each plate is N * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w)), multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct formula for the expected number of survivors in a single culture is N * [1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w)]. This accounts for the fact that cells can lose either lysogenic or wild-type phages, but not both, as only lysogenic phages cause death.\n\nHowever, in our case, we're looking at the combined effect of both mutation types. So, the probability that a cell survives is the probability that neither lysogenic nor wild-type phages cause death, which is (1 - P(l))*(1 - P(w)).\n\nNow, given that, we can set up equations based on the observed data.\n\nSuppose that the initial concentration of each mutation type is x and y, respectively. However, since the problem states that both types are present, and we're interested in the recombination between them, perhaps we can model the likelihood of observing the plume counts under different scenarios.\n\nBut maybe an easier approach is to compute the expected number of survivors per culture, considering the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nThe key is that each mutation independently reduces the chance of survival. So the combined reduction is (1 - P(l))(1 - P(w)).\n\nIn the experiment, the number of survivors on strain B is four plumes each with a dilution factor of 1:1e7, and on strain K, four plumes with a dilution factor of 1:1e5.\n\nLet me express the expected number of survivors as:\n\nFor strain B:\nNumber of survivors = (N / 1e7) * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w))\n\nSimilarly, for strain K:\nNumber of survivors = (N / 1e5) * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w))\n\nSince the experiment shows that on strain B, four plumes were found, and on strain K, four plumes were found, but with different dilutions, we can relate these to find the probabilities.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the dilution factor and the initial number of bacteria, we can write:\n\n(1 / 1e7) * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w)) = 4\n\nand\n\n(1 / 1e5) * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w)) = 4\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. The left side should have units of 1/number of bacteria, but the right side is just counts of plumes. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of survivors per plume is proportional to the dilution factor. So:\n\nNumber of survivors per plume on B: (N / 1e7) * (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w)) \u2248 4\n\nSimilarly, on K: (N / 1e5) * (same term) \u2248 4\n\nBut solving this seems tricky because we have two equations with three variables: N, P(l), P(w).\n\nPerhaps instead, we should look at the ratio of survivors between the two plating batches. Let's see:\n\nOn B: (N / 1e7) * S \u2248 4\n\nOn K: (N / 1e5) * S \u2248 4\n\nWhere S = (1 - P(l) - P(w) + P(l)*P(w))\n\nDividing the equation for K by B:\n\n(N / 1e5) * S / (N / 1e7) * S ) = 4 / 4\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(1e7 / 1e5) = 100\n\nWhich holds true, so this doesn't give us new information.\n\nMaybe instead, consider the difference in plume density between the two plating batches. Since the dilution factors differ, the same number of survivors would result in different counts depending on the dilution.\n\nWait, perhaps the main point here is to determine the recombination frequency, which is the probability that a mutation in one phage combines with a mutation in the other. In genetic terms, this is often expressed as the coefficient of coincidence, which is the product of the individual probabilities of each mutation occurring together.\n\nIn this context, the coefficient of coincidence (COC) is given by:\n\nCOC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (expected number of plasmids)\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent, the expected number of plasmids with both mutations would be:\n\nExpected = (probability of mutation in phage 1) * (probability of mutation in phage 2)\n\nAnd the observed number of such plasmids would be the COC.\n\nFrom the experiment, on strain B, there were four plasmids found, and on strain K, four plasmids as well. Given the different dilution factors, perhaps the COC relates to the observed counts.\n\nBut without knowing the exact relationship, it's challenging to directly compute the recombination frequency.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into halves, which suggests that some cells survived and others died. \n\nThen these halves are plated on different bacterial strains. One half is dilated by a factor of 1:10^7, meaning each replicate has about 10 million fewer bacteria. Plated on strain B, four plaques are found. On strain K, four were also found. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Hmm, maybe I misread that. It says that after being infected, the E. coli from the plates was split into two equal parts. Then one part was placed on strain B and the other on strain K. So each strain gets half the number of colonies.\n\nBut then each of those plating batches was further diluted by factors of 10^7 and 10^5 respectively. That means the actual numbers would be even lower, right? Because dilution affects the count.\n\nSo if we consider the initial population of E. coli, let's say there are N bacteria. After dilution by 1:10^7, each culture has N / 1e7 bacteria. Similarly for 1:10^5, it's N / 1e5. \n\nWhen you plate them on E. coli strain B or K, the chance of a mutation causing lysis depends on the number of phages. If both mutants are present, each phage has a certain probability of carrying each mutation. But since only lysogenic phages cause death, the presence of any lysogenic phage would kill the E. coli.\n\nWait, actually, no\u2014when multiple phages are present, if any die, the cells might survive. Or do all the phages have to carry both mutations for any cell to survive? No, that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the experiment measures whether at least one phage carries a mutation, leading to lysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the experiment counts how many cells survive after the phage infection. If a lysogenic phage is present, the cell dies; otherwise, it survives. Since there are two types of phages, the total number of cells that survive is the ones where neither phage carries the mutation. Wait, no\u2014since only the lysogenic phage can cause death, so any cell with a lysogenic phage will die. So survival requires that none of the phages cause death, i.e., no lysogenic phages or no lysogenic phages and no lysogenic phages again?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Suppose that when you plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause death. So cells that were infected with lysogenic phages die, while those with wild-type phages live. Therefore, the number of surviving cells on strain B should correspond to the proportion of cells without lysogenic phages, plus any cells with lysogenic phages that don't die due to another mutation. But in this case, only lysogenic phages cause death, so only cells without any lysogenic phages would survive. So the number of survivors on strain B would depend on the frequency of lysogenic phages and their ability to cause death.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, only lysogenic phages cause death, but if both mutations are present, cells could die either because of lysogenic or wild-type phages. Wait, no\u2014if both types are present, but only lysogenic phages cause death. So cells with lysogenic phages die, regardless of their type.

After incubation, there are four pluses on K and forty on B.\n\nHmm, so the experiment shows that some cells survive the first dilution (on strain B), which suggests that at least part of the mutation isn't causing an issue. Then these surviving cells go through another dilution and plate on a different strain where the mutation might be more prevalent or functional.\n\nLet me think about how recombination works here. Recombination refers to the combination of two mutations at different loci. In phages, especially T_4, which have multiple sites for insertions, recombination could occur during phage replication if they have multiple insertion points. So, each phage has its own set of mutations, and during replication, parts from each phage can combine.\n\nNow, looking at the results: On the first dilution (1:10^7), when plated on strain B, only four pluses appeared. This means that only four cells survived and were lysed, implying that most cells either didn't replicate or had mutations that allowed them to lyse. The remaining cells probably weren't affected by either mutation, meaning their mutations don't interfere with the lysogenic state.\n\nOn the second dilution (1:10^5), these surviving cells (plated on strain K) resulted in forty pluses. Strain K is likely a different strain where the mutation might be more common or functional. If the original mutation was causing issues in strain B, then in strain K, perhaps this mutation is more widespread or doesn't affect as much, allowing the lysogenic phage to survive better.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, so any mutation that affects its lysogenic state would prevent lysis. But if recombination occurs between the two mutations, it could lead to a new type of phage that doesn't lyse cells effectively even if one mutation is present. Or maybe the combination leads to lethality.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, having a recombined mutation might not kill them if the lysogenic state remains intact. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the concept of independent assortment. Each mutation site is separate, and during replication, parts can come together. If the two mutations are linked (recombining during replication), then the order matters. If they're independent, the mutations don't influence each other.\n\nIn the context of phage mutations, if the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that prevents it from being integrated into the host genome (like a transposase mutation), then recombination wouldn't happen. However, if the mutations are in different regions, recombination could occur, leading to recombinant phages that might have both mutations.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, so it must have a mutation that makes it lysogenic but not lytic. That usually involves a transposase insertion, making it integrate into the genome. If the other mutation is also a transposase, then recombination could occur, creating recombinant phages with both mutations.\n\nSo, the number of pluses depends on whether the lysogenic phage can replicate with the other mutation. If the other mutation allows the phage to replicate without requiring transposition, it might survive. But if it disrupts integration, it won't replicate.\n\nIn the experiment, after the first dilution, only four cells survived. These are probably cells with the lysogenic phage plus another mutation that allows it to replicate. Then, when these cells are plated on strain K, which may have a mutation that's less disruptive or more common, the phages that can replicate better survive. Since four cells replicated successfully on strain B, and now those same cells survive on strain K, we get forty pluses on K. Wait, that seems off because forty pluses on K would mean all except four die, but the initial four survived on B.\n\nWait, no, the total plasmid count increases due to replication. The original four cells would produce a certain number of new plasmids upon replication. If each cell produces many plasmids, say 100 per cell, then four cells would contribute 400 plasmids. When plated on strain B, which presumably has the lysogenic phage, these plasmids would replicate further, potentially leading to more plasmids. Similarly, when plated on strain K, the existing plasmids would replicate, but perhaps the strain K has a mutation that reduces replication efficiency.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, perhaps the key is to determine the frequency of the mutations relative to the total population.\n\nThe first dilution (1:10^7) shows four pluses. Assuming each cell divides into eight, the number of new plasmids added is 8 * 4 = 32. When these are plated on strain B, which is a strain that already has the lysogenic phage, the phage might replicate again. But regardless, the main point is that the presence of four pluses indicates that the lysogenic phage can replicate with some mutations, possibly leading to recombination.\n\nThen, when these cells are plated on strain K, which has a different mutation, perhaps a mutation that impairs replication, the phages that can replicate survive. So, if the original four cells can replicate in strain K, they'll contribute to plasmid counts there. But the exact numbers depend on the number of plasmids each cell contributes.\n\nIf each cell has N plasmids, then four cells contribute 4N plasmids. When plated on strain B, which requires lysogenic phages, these plasmids replicate enough to make a certain number of plasmids. But the observed plasmids on B are 40, which is a lot.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of expected plasmids. For the first dilution, each of the four cells has some plasmids. Plating on strain B, which requires lysogenic phages, will replicate these plasmids. The total plasmids after replication would be higher than before, but the question says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So, the number of plasmids after replication would increase by a factor of 8 (since each cell divides into eight).\n\nSimilarly, when plated on strain K, which is different, the plasmids replicate there too. But the key is that the number of plasmids on K is much lower compared to B, suggesting that some cells died on B because they couldn't replicate well there.\n\nWait, no, the number of plasmids on B is 40, which is similar to the original four plasmids times 10, so the plasmids increased by a factor of 10. That suggests that the original four cells replicated tenfold more efficiently on B.\n\nBut when plated on K, which is different, the number of plasmids is 40, which is much lower than on B, indicating that some cells died on K because they couldn't replicate.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage with the mutation that can replicate in both strains is more common than the other variant. Alternatively, the presence of the other mutation in strain B might have reduced replication efficiency in strain K.\n\nBut perhaps the key lies in calculating the probability of recombination. If the two mutations are linked (recombine), then the chance of recombination is proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If they're independent, it's just the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHowever, in this case, the observed data suggests that only four cells survived on the first dilution, implying that the majority of cells either had both mutations or neither, but some had one mutation allowing replication.\n\nWhen these cells are plated on strain K, which has a mutation that might reduce replication, the ones that can replicate better survive, leading to forty pluses on K. This suggests that the original four cells can replicate better on K, implying that recombination occurred, making the lysogenic phage more susceptible to replication in strain K.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of recombination between the two mutations is high. To find the percentage, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 2pq\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. But since we don't have the actual frequencies, we can infer from the results.\n\nEach cell has a certain probability of carrying both mutations. The fact that only four out of the rest survive suggests that the combined effect of both mutations is lethal, but individually, they allow replication.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency would be high, around 95% or so, considering that four out of several hundred cells survive. But wait, the numbers seem low. Wait, on the first dilution, four cells survived, which implies that the majority of cells either had both mutations or none. So, the survival rate is quite low, indicating a high recombination frequency.\n\nTo calculate this precisely, we can assume that the number of survivors (four) corresponds to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If each mutation has a frequency of x, then the chance of recombination is 2x(1-x). But without knowing x, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, using the rule of three: if a certain event occurs 4 times in 1000 trials, the recombination rate is approximately 0.4%. But our scenario is different; instead, the number of survivors suggests a higher frequency.\n\nGiven the options provided (from 0.02% to 0.5%), the closest is F. 0.3%.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. If the recombination frequency is high, the chance of a cell having both mutations is significant. The observed outcome is that only four cells can replicate, implying that recombination is very frequent. Therefore, the answer is likely F. 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli are split into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there are four pluses on K and forty on B.\n\nHmm, so the experiment shows that some cells survive the first dilution (on strain B), which suggests that at least part of the mutation isn't causing an issue. Then these surviving cells go through another dilution and plate on a different strain where the mutation might be more prevalent or functional.\n\nLet me think about how recombination works here. Recombination refers to the combination of two mutations at different loci. In phages, especially T_4, which have multiple sites for insertions, recombination could occur during phage replication if they have multiple insertion points. So, each phage has its own set of mutations, and during replication, parts from each phage can combine.\n\nNow, looking at the results: On the first dilution (1:10^7), when plated on strain B, only four pluses appeared. This means that only four cells survived and were lysed, implying that most cells either didn't replicate or had mutations that allowed them to lyse. The remaining cells probably weren't affected by either mutation, meaning their mutations don't interfere with the lysogenic state.\n\nOn the second dilution (1:10^5), these surviving cells (plated on strain K) resulted in forty pluses. Strain K is likely a different strain where the mutation might be more common or functional. If the original mutation was causing issues in strain B, then in strain K, perhaps this mutation is more widespread or doesn't affect as much, allowing the lysogenic phage to survive better.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, so any mutation that affects its lysogenic state would prevent lysis. But if recombination occurs between the two mutations, it could lead to a new type of phage that doesn't lyse cells effectively even if one mutation is present. Or maybe the combination leads to lethality.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, having a recombined mutation might not kill them if the lysogenic state remains intact. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the concept of independent assortment. Each mutation site is separate, and during replication, parts can come together. If the two mutations are linked (recombining during replication), then the order matters. If they're independent, the mutations don't influence each other.\n\nIn the context of phage mutations, if the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that prevents it from being integrated into the host genome (like a transposase mutation), then recombination wouldn't happen. However, if the mutations are in different regions, recombination could occur, leading to recombinant phages that might have both mutations.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, so it must have a mutation that makes it lysogenic but not lytic. That usually involves a transposase insertion, making it integrate into the genome. If the other mutation is also a transposase, then recombination could occur, creating recombinant phages with both mutations.\n\nSo, the number of pluses depends on whether the lysogenic phage can replicate with the other mutation. If the other mutation allows the phage to replicate without requiring transposition, it might survive. But if it disrupts integration, it won't replicate.\n\nIn the experiment, after the first dilution, only four cells survived. These are probably cells with the lysogenic phage plus another mutation that allows it to replicate. Then, when these cells are plated on strain K, which may have a mutation that's less disruptive or more common, the phages that can replicate better survive. Since four cells replicated successfully on strain B, and now those same cells survive on strain K, we get forty pluses on K. Wait, that seems off because forty pluses on K would mean all except four die, but the initial four survived on B.\n\nWait, no, the total plasmid count increases due to replication. The original four cells would produce a certain number of new plasmids upon replication. If each cell produces many plasmids, say 100 per cell, then four cells would contribute 400 plasmids. When plated on strain B, which presumably has the lysogenic phage, these plasmids would replicate further, potentially leading to more plasmids. Similarly, when plated on strain K, the existing plasmids would replicate, but perhaps the strain K has a mutation that reduces replication efficiency.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, perhaps the key is to determine the frequency of the mutations relative to the total population.\n\nThe first dilution (1:10^7) shows four pluses. Assuming each cell divides into eight, the number of new plasmids added is 8 * 4 = 32. When these are plated on strain B, which is a strain that already has the lysogenic phage, the phage might replicate again. But regardless, the main point is that the presence of four pluses indicates that the lysogenic phage can replicate with some mutations, possibly leading to recombination.\n\nThen, when these cells are plated on strain K, which has a different mutation, perhaps a mutation that impairs replication, the phages that can replicate survive. So, if the original four cells can replicate in strain K, they'll contribute to plasmid counts there. But the exact numbers depend on the number of plasmids each cell contributes.\n\nIf each cell has N plasmids, then four cells contribute 4N plasmids. When plated on strain B, which requires lysogenic phages, these plasmids replicate enough to make a certain number of plasmids. But the observed plasmids on B are 40, which is a lot.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of expected plasmids. For the first dilution, each of the four cells has some plasmids.

So the half that's on K has more successful infections than the half on B. That suggests that the mutation responsible for causing lysogeny (the lysogenic phage) is present in some cells but not all, leading to some division favoring the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the K culture.\n\nWait, actually, since the half from the mixed infection was placed on strain B's lawn, any lysogenic phage would be good for B, but if the lysogenic phage isn't present in enough quantity, maybe the lysogenic phage is better for K? Hmm, no, wait. The experiment says that when both types are present, the E. coli strains divide equally. Then, one half is plated on strain B, expecting lysogenic phages to cause lytic fission and die, while the other half is plated on strain K. But the results show more pluses on K than on B, meaning the K half had more successful infections.\n\nSo, what determines whether the lysogenic phage survives or not depends on its ability to integrate into the phage's DNA. If the lysogenic phage is resistant, it might survive; otherwise, it dies. The test here seems to indicate that the lysogenic phage is present in sufficient quantities to allow some E. coli to survive and grow when plated on strain B's lawn. However, when these same cells were plated on strain K, there were fewer pluses, suggesting that the lysogenic phage wasn't as effective there.\n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage is somewhat present but not dominant enough to thrive on strain B's lawn. Maybe because strain K lacks certain resistance markers or factors necessary for the lysogenic phage to integrate effectively. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is slightly mutated such that it can only integrate under specific conditions, which may vary depending on the host strain.\n\nNow, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the process where genetic information from two different sources combines. In this case, the two mutations are likely separate genes within the T_4 genome, each causing a different type of phage behavior.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nIn this experiment, half the bacteria (from the mixed infection) were plated on strain B and K. On strain B, there were 40 pluses, and on strain K, 4 pluses. So total pluses are 44. But wait, the problem states \"four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Wait, no\u2014the original description says that the half on strain B showed 40 pluses, and the half on strain K showed 4 pluses. So total pluses are 44, but how many did we observe?\n\nWait, let me clarify: when the mixed infection is plated on strain B, half of them (let's say N) are plated on B. Similarly, the other half (N) is plated on K. Suppose N is the number of bacteria in each group. For example, if N=100, then half is 50 on B, and 50 on K. But the actual numbers given are 40 on B and 4 on K, implying that N=44. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe each group (B and K) has 44/2=22 each. But the problem states four on K and 40 on B. That suggests that each half has 40 and 4 respectively. Wait, but that adds up to 44, which would imply N=22 per group. That makes sense: 22 on B, 22 on K, resulting in 44 pluses in total (40+4).\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The key point is that the presence of the lysogenic mutation leads to higher survival rates when the bacteria are plated on strain K compared to strain B. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is present in some cells but not all, leading to varying outcomes based on the host's resistance.\n\nHowever, another approach is to consider the concept of fitness effects. If the lysogenic phage is present in a strain (like K), it may have a selective advantage because it integrates better. Conversely, if it's present in another strain (like B), it might not benefit as much.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the recombination rate between the two mutations. To do that, I need to model the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently and then combine them.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = probability that the lysogenic mutation occurs in a bacterium.\n- q = probability that the phage acquires the lysogenic mutation during replication.\n\nIf the phage can replicate without acquiring the lysogenic mutation, it will integrate and become lysogenic. If it acquires the mutation, it won't integrate and remain phage.\n\nAssuming that the mutations occur independently, the combined effect is determined by the product of their probabilities.\n\nFrom the experiment, when the mixture is plated on strain K, the success rate is lower than when it's plated on strain B. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a lower fitness on strain K compared to strain B, meaning it's less likely to replicate successfully in strain K.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the lysogenic mutation may confer a fitness advantage in certain conditions, which could explain why the phages replicate better on strain K.\n\nBut to calculate recombination frequency, we need to know the probabilities of each mutation occurring. However, in this scenario, we don't have direct data on the occurrence rates of each mutation. Instead, the experiment shows differential success rates when the phages are plated on different bacterial strains.\n\nPerhaps the idea is that the lysogenic phage is present at a certain level that allows some cells to replicate successfully but not others, leading to differing outcomes in selection experiments.\n\nAnother angle: the recombination frequency can also be estimated using the number of recombinants over the total possible combinations. But without knowing the exact genotypes, it's tricky. However, in this context, the mutations are in the T_4 phage, and recombination would involve combining two independent mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the likelihood of integrating into the T_4 phage, thereby increasing the chance of lysogenicity.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage is better at replicating on strain K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage may have acquired some genetic material through recombination with the T_4 phage. Or perhaps the recombination occurred within the T_4 phage itself, introducing a new mutation that confers increased virulence.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way to look at it is that the recombination frequency would relate to the number of times the two mutations occurred together. However, without knowing the exact genotypes or allele frequencies, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency can be calculated as:\n\nR = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nBut in this case, the offspring are either on strain B or K. However, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in calculating the expected number of recombinants based on the observed results. Since the lysogenic phage is better on K, it indicates that the mutation introduced by recombination provides a selective advantage.\n\nAssuming that each mutation (mutation A and mutation B) occurs independently, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is p*q. The presence of both mutations allows the phage to integrate and become lysogenic, which helps it replicate better on strain K.\n\nBut I'm still stuck. Maybe I should think about it in terms of the ratio of plasmids or the distribution of mutations between the two groups.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed and split, the ones that replicate without the lysogenic mutation (i.e., the phages without the mutation) replicate faster on strain B because they're already integrated. On strain K, the phages with the lysogenic mutation replicate slower because they didn't integrate. Thus, the number of successful infections is higher on strain B, leading to more plasmids on B and fewer on K.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage has a lower fitness on K, possibly due to reduced integration efficiency. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic mutation increases the likelihood of the phage replicating successfully on strain B but not on K.\n\nSince the mutations are in the T_4 phage, the recombination would refer to the combination of these two mutations. However, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, recombination in the T_4 phage genome would mean that the two mutations occurred in the same phage, potentially combining into a larger mutation that confers an advantage. If the lysogenic phage has acquired a new mutation via recombination, this could increase its ability to replicate, leading to higher fitness differences between the two strains.\n\nThus, the amount of recombination would depend on how often these two mutations occurred together in the phage genome. Since the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage is present in some cells but not all, indicating partial integration, it suggests that the two mutations were present together in some fraction of cells.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would be the proportion of cells that have both mutations. However, without specific data on the mutation frequencies, it's challenging to quantify exactly. But the options provided suggest a small percentage, like 0.1% or similar.\n\nLooking at the options, H is 0.02%, and J is 0.05%. Given that the recombination event may not be very frequent, especially if the mutations are neutral or have low recombination rates, a small percentage like 0.02% or 0.05% seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is more successful on strain B, it might indicate that the mutation caused by recombination is beneficial for B but not for K, which could suggest that the recombination introduces a mutation that confers an advantage in B but not in K. Thus, the recombination rate might be low.\n\nConsidering all this, the most reasonable answer among the options would be F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). However, the initial reasoning suggested a small value, closer to 0.02%. But perhaps the exact calculation requires more detailed modeling.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the number of plasmids on strain B is higher than on strain K, indicating that the lysogenic phage replicated better on B. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that enhances its replication on B but not on K. This suggests that the recombination event has occurred in a way that creates a mutation beneficial for B but not for K.\n\nIf the recombination happens infrequently, the frequency would be low. Among the options, C (1.5%) and D (0.1%) are possibilities. However, without specific data, it's difficult to choose. Given that the answer choices include letters, and the correct answer is likely to be a small fraction, but I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother perspective: the problem involves two mutations in the T_4 phage, and we're looking for the recombination between them. The fact that the lysogenic phage is better on B suggests that recombination introduced a mutation that benefits B but not K. The frequency of such events would depend on the underlying recombination rates.\n\nGiven the options, the most likely answer is C (1.5%), but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, considering that the difference in plasmid counts reflects a partial replication advantage, which might correspond to a recombination frequency of around 0.05%.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the answer is B (2 percent).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

To do that, I need to model the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently and then combine them.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = probability that the lysogenic mutation occurs in a bacterium.\n- q = probability that the phage acquires the lysogenic mutation during replication.\n\nIf the phage can replicate without acquiring the lysogenic mutation, it will integrate and become lysogenic. If it acquires the mutation, it won't integrate and remain phage.\n\nAssuming that the mutations occur independently, the combined effect is determined by the product of their probabilities.\n\nFrom the experiment, when the mixture is plated on strain K, the success rate is lower than when it's plated on strain B. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a lower fitness on strain K compared to strain B, meaning it's less likely to replicate successfully in strain K.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the lysogenic mutation may confer a fitness advantage in certain conditions, which could explain why the phages replicate better on strain K.\n\nBut to calculate recombination frequency, we need to know the probabilities of each mutation occurring. However, in this scenario, we don't have direct data on the occurrence rates of each mutation. Instead, the experiment shows differential success rates when the phages are plated on different bacterial strains.\n\nPerhaps the idea is that the lysogenic phage is present at a certain level that allows some cells to replicate successfully but not others, leading to differing outcomes in selection experiments.\n\nAnother angle: the recombination frequency can also be estimated using the number of recombinants over the total possible combinations. But without knowing the exact genotypes, it's tricky. However, in this context, the mutations are in the T_4 phage, and recombination would involve combining two independent mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the likelihood of integrating into the T_4 phage, thereby increasing the chance of lysogenicity.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage is better at replicating on strain K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage may have acquired some genetic material through recombination with the T_4 phage. Or perhaps the recombination occurred within the T_4 phage itself, introducing a new mutation that confers increased virulence.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way to look at it is that the recombination frequency would relate to the number of times the two mutations occurred together. However, without knowing the exact genotypes or allele frequencies, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency can be calculated as:\n\nR = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nBut in this case, the offspring are either on strain B or K. However, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in calculating the expected number of recombinants based on the observed results. Since the lysogenic phage is better on K, it indicates that the mutation introduced by recombination provides a selective advantage.\n\nAssuming that each mutation (mutation A and mutation B) occurs independently, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is p*q. The presence of both mutations allows the phage to integrate and become lysogenic, which helps it replicate better on strain K.\n\nBut I'm still stuck. Maybe I should think about it in terms of the ratio of plasmids or the distribution of mutations between the two groups.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed and split, the ones that replicate without the lysogenic mutation (i.e., the phages without the mutation) replicate faster on strain B because they're already integrated. On strain K, the phages with the lysogenic mutation replicate slower because they didn't integrate. Thus, the number of successful infections is higher on strain B, leading to more plasmids on B and fewer on K.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage has a lower fitness on K, possibly due to reduced integration efficiency. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic mutation increases the likelihood of the phage replicating successfully on strain B but not on K.\n\nSince the mutations are in the T_4 phage, the recombination would refer to the combination of these two mutations. However, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, recombination in the T_4 phage genome would mean that the two mutations occurred in the same phage, potentially combining into a larger mutation that confers an advantage. If the lysogenic phage has acquired a new mutation via recombination, this could increase its ability to replicate, leading to higher fitness differences between the two strains.\n\nThus, the amount of recombination would depend on how often these two mutations occurred together in the phage genome. Since the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage is present in some cells but not all, indicating partial integration, it suggests that the two mutations were present together in some fraction of cells.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would be the proportion of cells that have both mutations. However, without specific data on the mutation frequencies, it's challenging to quantify exactly. But the options provided suggest a small percentage, like 0.1% or similar.\n\nLooking at the options, H is 0.02%, and J is 0.05%. Given that the recombination event may not be very frequent, especially if the mutations are neutral or have low recombination rates, a small percentage like 0.02% or 0.05% seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is more successful on strain B, it might indicate that the mutation caused by recombination is beneficial for B but not for K, which could suggest that the recombination introduces a mutation that confers an advantage in B but not in K. Thus, the recombination rate might be low.\n\nConsidering all this, the most reasonable answer among the options would be F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). However, the initial reasoning suggested a small value, closer to 0.02%. But perhaps the exact calculation requires more detailed modeling.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the number of plasmids on strain B is higher than on strain K, indicating that the lysogenic phage replicated better on B. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that enhances its replication on B but not on K. This suggests that the recombination event has occurred in a way that creates a mutation beneficial for B but not for K.\n\nIf the recombination happens infrequently, the frequency would be low. Among the options, C (1.5%) and D (0.1%) are possibilities. However, without specific data, it's difficult to choose. Given that the answer choices include letters, and the correct answer is likely to be a small fraction, but I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother perspective: the problem involves two mutations in the T_4 phage, and we're looking for the recombination between them. The fact that the lysogenic phage is better on B suggests that recombination introduced a mutation that benefits B but not K. The frequency of such events would depend on the underlying recombination rates.\n\nGiven the options, the most likely answer is C (1.5%), but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, considering that the difference in plasmid counts reflects a partial replication advantage, which might correspond to a recombination frequency of around 0.05%.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the answer is B (2 percent).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Interference occurs when a new mutation affects the replication of an existing one. If there's no interference, you'd expect double the number of plumes as expected. So let's calculate the expected vs observed.\n\nIn the first case, dilution 1:10^7 leads to four plumes. Normally, without interference, each phage would cause one division per cell, so for 1:10^7, we'd expect about 10^7 cells being affected, but since each phage affects one cell, maybe it's different.

But I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look at the data again. The first sample has 4 plumes on B, which was treated with 1:10^7 dilution. The second has 4 on K, treated with 1:10^5 dilution. Since 1:10^5 is 100 times higher than 1:10^7, the effect might be more pronounced here. \n\nThe key idea is that if two mutations interfere, the occurrence of one mutation in one cell affects the likelihood of another mutation occurring elsewhere. So the number of plumes would depend on how much interference there is. \n\nIf the two mutations didn't interfere, the number of plumes would be approximately proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, right? Or maybe inversely proportional. Wait, I think I recall that the expected number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(N), where N is the dilution factor. So for example, at 1:10^7, the expected number would be sqrt(1e7) \u2248 316. But in reality, it's 4, which suggests some level of interference.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage is bad, so any mutation that causes lysis shouldn't affect strain B. So the recombination must be happening between the lysogenic and lysogenic phage. Hmm, no, because the lysogenic phage wouldn't cause issues regardless of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the two mutations are on the same gene or separate genes. If the mutations recombine, it could lead to a new mutation that's expressed differently, possibly affecting the lysogenic fission activity. So if the two mutants are on the same gene, their recombination would produce a new allele that confers resistance or susceptibility, leading to interference.\n\nAlternatively, if they're on different genes, the recombination might not influence the lysogenic activity directly, unless it creates a new functional mutation. But the problem says the lysogenic phage is bad, so any recombination would affect the lysogenic fission mechanism.\n\nSo, going back to the experiment. The expected number of plumes from a single phage carrying both mutations would be lower due to interference. In the first case, 1:10^7, expecting around 100 plumes, but got 4, suggesting significant interference. Similarly, at 1:10^5, expecting like 316 plumes, but got 4 on K. That seems too low\u2014maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor. So for a dilution factor D, the expected number of plumes is sqrt(D). So:\n\nAt D=1e7, sqrt(1e7)=316. They got 4, which is way below that. At D=1e5, sqrt(1e5)=316.23, and they got 4 on K, which also seems low. This suggests that either the data is inconsistent or my approach is wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, the expected number of plumes is proportional to D^(1/2), meaning the actual number is lower. So, if the expected was 316, but they saw 4, the interference is high. Alternatively, maybe the expected is D^(something else).\n\nAnother thought: The formula for interference is that the observed number of additional plumes is equal to the expected number minus interference. So, if the expected is E, and observed is O, then O = E - I*E, where I is the interference coefficient. \n\nFor example, if E is 100, and I is 0.9, O would be 90. But in our case, at D=1e7, O=4, E=sqrt(D)=316. So O=E*(1-I). Thus, 4=316*(1-I), so I\u2248(316-4)/316\u22480.985. That means a very high level of interference. \n\nSimilarly, at D=1e5, E=sqrt(1e5)=316.23, O=4. Then I=(316.23-4)/316.23\u22480.968. Still high interference.\n\nThis suggests that the two mutations are interfering with each other heavily. Now, how do these interferences relate to the percentage of recombination?\n\nRecombination frequency (RF) is often measured as the percentage of double crossovers between homologous chromosomes. RF can be calculated using the formula RF = (1 - e^{-2p}), where p is the crossover rate per chromosome. However, this assumes random mating and independent assortment.\n\nBut in our case, the interference suggests that the mutations are not assorting independently. High interference indicates that once a mutation occurs, it makes the next mutation less likely. This is sometimes referred to as interference or co-recombination.\n\nInterference (I) is calculated as I = 1 - (observed / expected). Here, at D=1e7, expected E=316, observed O=4, so I=1 - (4/316)=~0.985. Similarly, at D=1e5, I=~0.968.\n\nNow, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. How does interference relate to recombination frequency?\n\nI recall that in regions of high recombination, the interference is lower because multiple crossover events happen nearby, making the mutations more dependent on each other. Lower interference implies higher recombination frequency because the presence of one mutation influences the likelihood of another nearby mutation.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nAt D=1e7, I=0.985 \u2192 almost complete independence.\nAt D=1e5, I=0.968 \u2192 still quite independent.\n\nThese seem to indicate a high degree of independence, implying low recombination frequency. So the amount of recombination between the two mutations is probably low.\n\nTo find the exact value, I might need to use the formula relating interference to recombination frequency. The formula is:\n\nI = (1 - 2p + p^2)\n\nWhere p is the crossover frequency per chromosome. Rearranging, we get:\n\np = [1 - sqrt(1 - 2I)] / 2\n\nPlugging in I=0.985:\n\nsqrt(1 - 2*0.985) = sqrt(1 - 1.97) = sqrt(-0.97) \u2192 negative, which isn't possible. Maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nI = 1 - (expected / observed). Wait, earlier calculation shows I=1 - (O/E). So perhaps I should use the reciprocal.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The formula for interference is:\n\nI = 1 - (observed / expected)\n\nWhich gives us I=1 - (O/E). So when O/E is high, I is low. But in our cases, O/E is 4/316\u22480.0127, so I\u22480.9873. That seems off because I usually ranges between 0 and 1. Wait, perhaps I should take absolute values.\n\nActually, I think I should use the formula:\n\nI = (E - O) / E\n\nBecause I is the fraction of expected events not observed.\n\nAt D=1e7, E=316, O=4, so I=(316-4)/316\u22480.9873. That's a very high interference, indicating little to no interaction between the mutations.\n\nSimilarly, at D=1e5, I\u2248(316.23-4)/316.23\u22480.968.\n\nSo the higher the I, the less interference, implying lower recombination frequency.\n\nUsing the formula I mentioned earlier:\n\nI = 1 - 2p + p^2\n\nRearranged:\n\np = [1 - sqrt(1 - 2I)] / 2\n\nPlugging in I=0.9873:\n\nsqrt(1 - 2*0.9873) = sqrt(1 - 1.9746) = sqrt(-0.9746) \u2192 imaginary. Something's wrong here. It can't give an imaginary number. Maybe the formula is incorrect for this context.\n\nAlternative approach: Use the approximation for small I:\n\np \u2248 (1 - I)/2\n\nSince I is close to 1, 1 - I is small.\n\nAt I=0.9873:\n\np\u2248(1 - 0.9873)/2\u22480.0127/2\u22480.00635\u2192 ~0.635%.\n\nThat seems low. But looking at the options, the lowest is 0.05%, which is option J.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the recombination frequency is the proportion of double crossovers. If the recombination frequency is 0.635%, that would correspond to about 0.00635% of the population having double crossovers. But the options don't go down that far; the smallest is 0.05%. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try with I=0.9873.\n\nUsing the formula p = (1 - sqrt(1 - 2I))/2.\n\nWait, substituting I=0.9873:\n\n1 - 2I = 1 - 1.9746 = -0.9746. Square root of a negative number is not real. That suggests that I cannot be greater than 0.5. Because if I > 0.5, 1 - 2I becomes negative, and taking square roots is impossible. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let's check the formula correctly. The correct formula for interference is:\n\nI = 1 - (observed / expected)\n\nSo at D=1e7, I=1 - (4/316)=1 - 0.0127\u22480.9873. But this gives I > 0.5, which is impossible because interference can't exceed 1, but even so, in reality, interference is limited because you can't have more than 100% interference. But in practice, I cannot be greater than 1, and when I exceeds 0.5, the equation breaks down because the square root becomes undefined. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that for I > 0.5, the approximation p\u2248(1 - I)/2 holds, even though mathematically it doesn't make sense. \n\nGiven that, at I=0.9873, p\u2248(1 - 0.9873)/2\u22480.0127/2\u22480.00635, which is 0.635%. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. The closest is option G: 0.5%, which is higher than 0.635%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the formula.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is p = (1 - sqrt(1 - 2I)) / 2. Plugging I=0.9873:\n\nsqrt(1 - 2*0.9873)=sqrt(1 - 1.9746)=sqrt(-0.9746). Not possible. So perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the interference is very high (I approaches 1), the recombination frequency p is approaching zero. So the amount of recombination is minimal. Looking at the options, the lowest is 0.05%, which is option J.\n\nTherefore, the answer is J. 0.05%\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal parts. One part is then diluted 1:10^7 and plated on E. coli strain B's lawn, resulting in four plumes. The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, giving four more plumes on K. \n\nFrom what I remember, in such experiments, if a mutation recombines with another, you should see more or less interference. Interference occurs when a new mutation affects the replication of an existing one. If there's no interference, you'd expect double the number of plumes as expected. So let's calculate the expected vs observed.\n\nIn the first case, dilution 1:10^7 leads to four plumes. Normally, without interference, each phage would cause one division per cell, so for 1:10^7, we'd expect about 10^7 cells being affected, but since each phage affects one cell, maybe it's different. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the expected number under no interference. For a given mutation causing interference, the expected number of plumes would be lower than twice the number of colonies. \n\nWait, actually, when interference occurs, the number of additional plumes caused by a second mutation is less than expected. So if you have two mutations, M1 and M2, the expected number of plumes from a single phage carrying both mutations would be N = n * p, where n is the total number of cells, and p is the probability of plating at that density.

Each plume indicates that there's an exposed lysic disk, meaning the phage was lysogenic and caused death. So, each half from the division has some number of plumes. Since the original sample was split into two halves, each half should have the same number of plumes, right? If we had 40 on B, each half would have 20, and similarly for K, each half would have 20 as well.\n\nNow, the key here is the recombination of the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occur at the same site or different sites within the T_4 phage. If they're at the same site, they don't recombine; if they're different sites, they do. This affects how often the combination of these mutations leads to lysogeny.\n\nThe formula I remember relates the number of recombinants to the square root of the total number of plasmids. Specifically, the fraction of cells that exhibit the combination of mutations (recombinant plasmids) is sqrt(n), where n is the number of plasmids. However, in our case, since each half is treated separately, maybe we're looking at the probability of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of probabilities. For each mutation, let's say p is the probability that a phage carries mutation X (lysogenic) and q is the probability that it carries mutation Y (lytic). The combined probability of having both mutations is p*q. In the experiment, when both types were present, the lysogenic phage led to half of the colonies being lysed, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is more common than wild-type. But in the dilution steps, the probabilities might be different due to varying concentrations.\n\nBut focusing back on the recombination, the initial population has both types. After splitting, each half has either only type X or type Y. Then, each is tested against two strains: B and K. The outcome depends on how likely each mutation is to occur in each strain. Since the results show that only strain B is affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent in strain B. \n\nIf the two mutations occurred at the same site, the probability that a phage carrying both mutations would lyse the cell is higher. However, in this case, since both types were present, the effect is observed in both strains. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage is more common in strain B. Therefore, the two mutations must be at different sites within the T_4 genome, leading to independent recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula that relates the number of recombinants to the square root of the total number of plasmids. Here, the number of recombinants is 4 on K and 20 on each half. Wait, actually, in the context of phage experiments, the expected number of recombinants (plumes) is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. \n\nAssuming that each half has a certain frequency of each mutation, and the presence of both mutations in a phage increases its likelihood of causing lysis. Since only strain B is affected, the lysogenic phage must be more common in B. To calculate the recombination rate, we consider that the observed number of plumes on K is 4, which corresponds to the number of recombinant phages. Similarly, on B, it's 20, assuming each half contributes equally. \n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) is RF = \u221a(n), where n is the number of recombinant plasmids. Alternatively, in phage experiments, the number of recombinants R is given by R = \u221a(N), where N is the total number of phages, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nSince the experiment shows that when both mutantphages are present, only strain B is affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more common in B. Let\u2019s denote the proportion of lysogenic phages in B as p and in K as q. If the two mutations are at different sites, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p*q. However, in the presence of both types, the lysogenic phages cause lethality in both strains, while wild-type phages may affect only one or neither.\n\nGiven that only strain B is affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage is more frequent in B. The experiment also shows that each half (which represents the population after being split) has 20 plumes on B and 20 on K.

On B, there are 4 plumes, which means 4 lysogenic phages were exposed. On K, there are 40 plumes, meaning 40 lysogenic phages were exposed. But wait, the plate was plated on strain B, so any lysogenic phages would lyse the bacteria. Similarly, those on strain K would lyse them too.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets divided into two equal parts. One part is then placed on strain B's lawn, and another on strain K's lawn. \n\nThe results are four plumes on K and 40 on B. Each plume indicates that there's an exposed lysic disk, meaning the phage was lysogenic and caused death. So, each half from the division has some number of plumes. Since the original sample was split into two halves, each half should have the same number of plumes, right? If we had 40 on B, each half would have 20, and similarly for K, each half would have 20 as well.\n\nNow, the key here is the recombination of the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occur at the same site or different sites within the T_4 phage. If they're at the same site, they don't recombine; if they're different sites, they do. This affects how often the combination of these mutations leads to lysogeny.\n\nThe formula I remember relates the number of recombinants to the square root of the total number of plasmids. Specifically, the fraction of cells that exhibit the combination of mutations (recombinant plasmids) is sqrt(n), where n is the number of plasmids. However, in our case, since each half is treated separately, maybe we're looking at the probability of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of probabilities. For each mutation, let's say p is the probability that a phage carries mutation X (lysogenic) and q is the probability that it carries mutation Y (lytic). The combined probability of having both mutations is p*q. In the experiment, when both types were present, the lysogenic phage led to half of the colonies being lysed, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is more common than wild-type. But in the dilution steps, the probabilities might be different due to varying concentrations.\n\nBut focusing back on the recombination, the initial population has both types. After splitting, each half has either only type X or type Y. Then, each is tested against two strains: B and K. The outcome depends on how likely each mutation is to occur in each strain. Since the results show that only strain B is affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent in strain B. \n\nIf the two mutations occurred at the same site, the probability that a phage carrying both mutations would lyse the cell is higher. However, in this case, since both types were present, the effect is observed in both strains. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage is more common in strain B. Therefore, the two mutations must be at different sites within the T_4 genome, leading to independent recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula that relates the number of recombinants to the square root of the total number of plasmids. Here, the number of recombinants is 4 on K and 20 on each half. Wait, actually, in the context of phage experiments, the expected number of recombinants (plumes) is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. \n\nAssuming that each half has a certain frequency of each mutation, and the presence of both mutations in a phage increases its likelihood of causing lysis. Since only strain B is affected, the lysogenic phage must be more common in B. To calculate the recombination rate, we consider that the observed number of plumes on K is 4, which corresponds to the number of recombinant phages. Similarly, on B, it's 20, assuming each half contributes equally. \n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) is RF = \u221a(n), where n is the number of recombinant plasmids. Alternatively, in phage experiments, the number of recombinants R is given by R = \u221a(N), where N is the total number of phages, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nSince the experiment shows that when both mutantphages are present, only strain B is affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more common in B. Let\u2019s denote the proportion of lysogenic phages in B as p and in K as q. If the two mutations are at different sites, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p*q. However, in the presence of both types, the lysogenic phages cause lethality in both strains, while wild-type phages may affect only one or neither.\n\nGiven that only strain B is affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage is more frequent in B. The experiment also shows that each half (which represents the population after being split) has 20 plumes on B and 20 on K. Since only B is affected, the number of plumes on B is lower, indicating less frequent occurrence of the lysogenic phage in B compared to K.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the first half, it's placed on B, and the second half on K.

The results show four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so let me break this down. In the first half (diluted 1:10^7), all the mutants should affect E. coli B. Since only lysogenic phages cause issues, those plasmids would lead to the cells dying or not dividing properly. So if the phages are from the lysogenic type, which don't lyse, then E. coli B would die. Wait, no, actually, lysogenic phages cause the phage DNA to be integrated into the host genome, leading to replication without lysing the cell. So if you have lysogenic phages, the phage DNA stays inside, so E. coli continues to grow. If you have the lytic phage, it lyses the cell, killing it.\n\nWait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again. The lysogenic phages integrate their DNA into the host genome, allowing them to replicate without lysing the cell. So when you have multiple copies of such phages, each one integrates into the same chromosome. So if you have two lysogenic phages, they both have their DNA inserted into the same chromosome. That means they might interfere with each other, either causing double replication or something else? Or perhaps in terms of selection pressure, having more than one copy could favor the integration?\n\nBut back to the experiment. The first dilution (1:10^7) was used for E. coli B. The second dilution (1:10^5) was used for E. coli K. The results were four pluses on K and 40 on B. I'm assuming pluses mean the phage caused death, as per the problem statement.\n\nSo in the first half, which is 1:10^7 dilution, the E. coli B is being plated. They were infected by both mutant types. So any lysogenic phages would replicate without lysing, meaning B would survive. However, since the phage DNA is integrated into the genome, there might be competition among the phages for the same replication sites. This could lead to a phenomenon called \"recombination\" where the phage genes interleave during replication, increasing the probability of selecting certain genes over others. This leads to some phages being selected for when replicating, effectively creating recombinant phage genomes.\n\nIn the presence of multiple mutants, especially when their DNA is integrated into the same chromosome, the chance of recombination increases. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication between different chromosomes. In the case of T_4 phages, which typically have two copies of the recombination site (R1 and R2), the phage genome consists of a backbone with these two sites. When phages integrate their DNA, they can form recombinant versions where the order of the sites is swapped. These recombinants may have higher fitness than non-recombinant phages because they can better integrate into the host genome, potentially leading to stronger selection pressures.\n\nNow, considering the experiment, when the first half (1:10^7 dilution) is plated on E. coli B, and since only lysogenic phages are problematic, we'd expect fewer deaths. But wait, no\u2014actually, lysogenic phages shouldn't kill the bacteria; instead, they just allow continued growth. So in the absence of lysogenic phages, E. coli B would grow. However, the presence of lysogenic phages would lead to selection for their integration. So when multiple lysogenic phages are present, there's an increased likelihood of recombination because the phage DNA has to navigate through the replicated regions, and this introduces variation among the phages. This variation can select for specific combinations of recombination events, leading to some phages being more fit than others.\n\nThe key here is that the number of plasmid copies detected on each lawn depends on how many times the phage DNA was selected for replication. Each time the phage replicates, if it successfully selects for the correct site (R1 followed by R2 or vice versa), it becomes dominant, whereas if it selects against, it's lost. Over time, the most common phage genome will dominate due to positive selection, leading to a proportion of recombinant phages in the population.\n\nGiven that, when the first half (1:10^7 dilution) is plated on E. coli B, and since only lysogenic phages are bad, the plasmids should spread, but selection occurs. If there's significant recombination, this will increase the frequency of recombinant phages. Similarly, when the second half is plated on E. coli K, the same process happens, but the outcome reflects the initial conditions.\n\nFrom the results, in the first half (E. coli B), 40 pluses were found. In the second half (E. coli K), 4 pluses were found. The total plasmids in each sample would depend on the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means each sample contains 1/10^7 of the original plasmid concentration. Similarly, 1:10^5 would contain 1/10^5.\n\nIf the recombination rate is high, say x%, then the frequency of recombinant phages would be higher. The expected number of plasmids would reflect this. However, in the first half, the majority of plasmids (96%) didn't cause death, suggesting that most phages integrated correctly. But the exact numbers depend on the selection process.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = (number of successful plasmids) / (total plasmids)\n\nAssuming p is the frequency of recombinant phages, and r is the recombination rate (as a fraction). The relationship between p and r is given by the binomial distribution, but for small r, it approximates to:\n\np \u2248 r * n\n\nwhere n is the number of trials. However, in reality, p \u2248 2\u221a(nr(1-r)), but for small r, it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence C, which relates the observed recombination rate to the actual rate. The coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of the observed recombination rate to the expected recombination rate under random mating.\n\nHowever, since the problem provides specific numbers, perhaps we can infer the recombination percentage directly from the experimental results.\n\nLooking at the results:\n- First half (E. coli B): 40 pluses.\n- Second half (E. coli K): 4 pluses.\n\nEach half represents a dilution of 1:10^n. The first half is 1:10^7, and the second is 1:10^5.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the recombination rate affects the number of plasmids detected. If the recombination rate is high, more plasmids will be recombinant, leading to more pluses.\n\nSuppose the recombination rate is r. Then, the expected number of plasmids on each lawn would be proportional to r. However, since each sample is a different dilution, the absolute numbers depend on the initial concentrations.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the ratio of plasmids detected in each sample. Since the first sample is more dilute (higher concentration), and the second is less dilute (lower concentration), the relative plasmids would depend inversely on the dilution factor.\n\nFor the first sample (1:10^7):\nNumber of plasmids detected = 40.\n\nFor the second sample (1:10^5):\nNumber of plasmids detected = 4.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids in the first sample to the second is 40 : 4 = 10:1, which suggests that the first sample had ten times more plasmids than the second. Given that the first sample is 10^7 times higher in concentration than the second (since 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), this aligns with the idea that the recombination rate is consistent across samples.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate is likely around 1% because the plasmids detected are relatively few compared to the total available, indicating moderate recombination activity.\n\nWait, but let me test this reasoning. If recombination occurred at 1%, then in a large population, a significant proportion of the phages would be recombinant. However, in the presence of multiple mutants, the recombination might occur even at lower rates because the selection pressure favors certain configurations.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plasmids detected is proportional to the product of the recombination rate and the dilution factor. So, plasmids detected \u221d r * (1/dilution factor).\n\nIn the first sample (1:10^7), plasmids detected = 40 = r * 10^7.\n\nIn the second sample (1:10^5), plasmids detected = 4 = r * 10^5.\n\nSolving for r in both cases:\n\nFrom first sample: r = 40 / 10^7 = 4e-6.\n\nFrom second sample: r = 4 / 10^5 = 4e-5.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here because the recombination rate should be constant across samples. This suggests that my assumption is incorrect, and perhaps the recombination rate isn't exactly the same in both samples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is applied differently. Maybe the plasmids are selected based on their ability to replicate, which could depend on the number of times they've been selected for recombination.\n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the probability that a phage is recombinant is approximately r. Therefore, the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to r multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nWait, but in reality, the probability of a phage being recombinant is r, so the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to r * (dilution factor - 1).\n\nIn the first sample (1:10^7), the number of plasmids detected is 40. Assuming that each plasmid has a probability r of being selected for recombination, the expected number of plasmids would be r * (10^7 - 1) \u2248 r * 10^7.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample, it's r * 10^5.\n\nSetting up equations:\n\n40 \u2248 r * 10^7 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-6.\n\n4 \u2248 r * 10^5 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-5.\n\nThis inconsistency implies that my model is flawed. Perhaps the recombination doesn't happen uniformly across all replication attempts. Instead, it might follow a different mechanism, like interference or other factors affecting the selection pressure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination rate is applied multiplicatively. Suppose the recombination rate is r, then the probability that a phage is recombinant is r, and the effective selection pressure reduces the number of plasmids.\n\nIn that case, the number of plasmids detected would decrease exponentially with the dilution factor. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to apply.\n\nGiven the options provided (from 0.02% to 0.5%), and considering that the recombination rate is low enough that only a small fraction of phages are recombinant, the answer is likely option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Considering that 0.5% is closer to the calculated value based on the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the probabilities:\n\nIn the first sample, 40 plasmids detected out of a possible 1e7. So the probability per plasmid is 40/(1e7) = 4e-6.\n\nIn the second sample, 4 plasmids out of 1e5, so probability per plasmid is 4e-5.\n\nSince the recombination rate should be the same, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results. Maybe the plasmids detected are proportional to the square root of the dilution factor or something else, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is applied in a way that the number of plasmids detected scales linearly with the dilution factor, implying a much lower recombination rate. But none of the options go below 0.02%.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are 0.02% to 0.5%. So 0.5% seems plausible if the recombination rate is about 5e-3 (0.05%).\n\nBut earlier calculations suggested 4e-6, which is 0.0004%, which is much lower than any of the options. This contradiction suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the number of plasmids detected is related to the number of viable phages, which depends on the number of times they've been selected for recombination. If the recombination rate is r, then the probability that a phage remains viable is approximately e^{-r} (using the approximation for rare events). However, this assumes independent events, which may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is r, the expected number of plasmids detected would be proportional to r multiplied by the dilution factor. Thus:\n\nFirst sample: 40 = k * r * 1e7.\n\nSecond sample: 4 = k * r * 1e5.\n\nDividing the first equation by the second gives 10 = 1e7 / 1e5 = 100, which implies 10 = 100k*r, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, solving for k and r:\n\nFrom first: 40 = k * r * 1e7 \u21d2 k*r=4e-6.\n\nFrom second: 4 = k*r*1e5 \u21d2 k*r=4e-5.\n\nAgain, inconsistency arises because k*r cannot be both 4e-6 and 4e-5. This indicates that the model is incorrect or incomplete.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that the observed plasmids are a result of the selection pressure favoring certain combinations. If the recombination rate is r, then the number of plasmids detected would scale with the dilution factor. So, the observed number of plasmids N is proportional to r * (1/dilution factor).\n\nThus, for the first sample (1:1e7):\n\nN1 = r * (1/1e7) \u21d2 40 = r * 1e-7 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e6.\n\nBut this is impossible because r must be less than 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted it. Maybe N1 = r * (1/dilution factor), so:\n\n40 = r * (1/1e7) \u21d2 r = 4e7.\n\nThat's way too high. Clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: The number of plasmids detected is proportional to the product of the recombination rate and the dilution factor. So,\n\nN1 = r * (1/d1)\n\nN2 = r * (1/d2)\n\nWhere d1 and d2 are the dilution factors.\n\nGiven N1 = 40, N2 = 4,\n\nWe have:\n\n40 = r * (1/1e7) \u21d2 r = 4e7.\n\n4 = r * (1/1e5) \u21d2 r = 4e5.\n\nAgain, inconsistent values for r. This suggests that the model is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct relation is N1 = r * (d2/d1), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the plasmids are selected based on the number of times they have been replicated, and each replication attempt has a chance of recombination. So, the number of plasmids detected would be proportional to the number of successful replication attempts, which depends on the recombination rate.\n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the probability of a successful replication without recombination is (1 - r)^n, where n is the number of replication attempts. However, without knowing n, this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I'll make an educated guess based on the options and the trend. The first sample shows a much higher number of plasmids detected (40) than the second (4). This suggests that the recombination rate is lower in the first sample because the dilution factor is larger, meaning there are more plasmids to detect. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is the same, the smaller dilution factor would yield fewer plasmids, which matches the data.\n\nIf the recombination rate is consistent, then r * (1/dilution factor) should give similar values. However, in our previous calculation, it led to inconsistencies. Perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination rate is very low, making the difference in plasmid counts manageable.\n\nConsidering that the options include 0.5%, which is roughly the square root of 0.025%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.5%, then:\n\nFor the first sample: 40 plasmids = 0.5% * 1e7 \u21d2 40 = 0.005 * 1e7 \u21d2 40 = 5e5 \u21d2 No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids detected is equal to the recombination rate multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nSo, N = r * D.\n\nThen,\n\n40 = r * 1e7 \u21d2 r = 4e-6.\n\n4 = r * 1e5 \u21d2 r = 4e-5.\n\nAgain, inconsistency. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the observed number of plasmids is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should look for patterns. The first sample has 40 plasmids, which is 10 times more than the second sample (4). If the recombination rate is consistent, then:\n\n40 = r * 1e7 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-6.\n\n4 = r * 1e5 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-5.\n\nBut this doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is the same, and the observed plasmids are reduced by the dilution factor. So:\n\nr = 40 / (1e7 * something).\n\nBut I'm stuck, so I'll make an educated guess. Looking at the options, 0.5% is close to the 0.005% implied by the first sample (40 plasmids detected in 1e7 dilution). So, 0.5% makes sense.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains split equally into two halves. One half is further diluted 1:10^7 and plated on B's lawn, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on K's lawn. The results show four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so let me break this down. In the first half (diluted 1:10^7), all the mutants should affect E. coli B. Since only lysogenic phages cause issues, those plasmids would lead to the cells dying or not dividing properly. So if the phages are from the lysogenic type, which don't lyse, then E. coli B would die. Wait, no, actually, lysogenic phages cause the phage DNA to be integrated into the host genome, leading to replication without lysing the cell. So if you have lysogenic phages, the phage DNA stays inside, so E. coli continues to grow. If you have the lytic phage, it lyses the cell, killing it.\n\nWait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again. The lysogenic phages integrate their DNA into the host genome, allowing them to replicate without lysing the cell. So when you have multiple copies of such phages, each one integrates into the same chromosome. So if you have two lysogenic phages, they both have their DNA inserted into the same chromosome. That means they might interfere with each other, either causing double replication or something else? Or perhaps in terms of selection pressure, having more than one copy could favor the integration?\n\nBut back to the experiment. The first dilution (1:10^7) was used for E. coli B. The second dilution (1:10^5) was used for E. coli K. The results were four pluses on K and 40 on B. I'm assuming pluses mean the phage caused death, as per the problem statement.\n\nSo in the first half, which is 1:10^7 dilution, the E. coli B is being plated. They were infected by both mutant types. So any lysogenic phages would replicate without lysing, meaning B would survive. However, since the phage DNA is integrated into the genome, there might be competition among the phages for the same replication sites. This could lead to a phenomenon called \"recombination\" where the phage genes interleave during replication, increasing the probability of selecting certain genes over others. This leads to some phages being selected for when replicating, effectively creating recombinant phage genomes.\n\nIn the presence of multiple mutants, especially when their DNA is integrated into the same chromosome, the chance of recombination increases. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication between different chromosomes. In the case of T_4 phages, which typically have two copies of the recombination site (R1 and R2), the phage genome consists of a backbone with these two sites. When phages integrate their DNA, they can form recombinant versions where the order of the sites is swapped. These recombinants may have higher fitness than non-recombinant phages because they can better integrate into the host genome, potentially leading to stronger selection pressures.\n\nNow, considering the experiment, when the first half (1:10^7 dilution) is plated on E. coli B, and since only lysogenic phages are problematic, we'd expect fewer deaths. But wait, no\u2014actually, lysogenic phages shouldn't kill the bacteria; instead, they just allow continued growth. So in the absence of lysogenic phages, E. coli B would grow. However, the presence of lysogenic phages would lead to selection for their integration. So when multiple lysogenic phages are present, there's an increased likelihood of recombination because the phage DNA has to navigate through the replicated regions, and this introduces variation among the phages. This variation can select for specific combinations of recombination events, leading to some phages being more fit than others.\n\nThe key here is that the number of plasmid copies detected on each lawn depends on how many times the phage DNA was selected for replication. Each time the phage replicates, if it successfully selects for the correct site (R1 followed by R2 or vice versa), it becomes dominant, whereas if it selects against, it's lost. Over time, the most common phage genome will dominate due to positive selection, leading to a proportion of recombinant phages in the population.\n\nGiven that, when the first half (1:10^7 dilution) is plated on E. coli B, and since only lysogenic phages are bad, the plasmids should spread, but selection occurs. If there's significant recombination, this will increase the frequency of recombinant phages. Similarly, when the second half is plated on E. coli K, the same process happens, but the outcome reflects the initial conditions.\n\nFrom the results, in the first half (E. coli B), 40 pluses were found. In the second half (E. coli K), 4 pluses were found. The total plasmids in each sample would depend on the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means each sample contains 1/10^7 of the original plasmid concentration. Similarly, 1:10^5 would contain 1/10^5.\n\nIf the recombination rate is high, say x%, then the frequency of recombinant phages would be higher. The expected number of plasmids would reflect this. However, in the first half, the majority of plasmids (96%) didn't cause death, suggesting that most phages integrated correctly. But the exact numbers depend on the selection process.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = (number of successful plasmids) / (total plasmids)\n\nAssuming p is the frequency of recombinant phages, and r is the recombination rate (as a fraction). The relationship between p and r is given by the binomial distribution, but for small r, it approximates to:\n\np \u2248 r * n\n\nwhere n is the number of trials. However, in reality, p \u2248 2\u221a(nr(1-r)), but for small r, it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence C, which relates the observed recombination rate to the actual rate. The coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of the observed recombination rate to the expected recombination rate under random mating.\n\nHowever, since the problem provides specific numbers, perhaps we can infer the recombination percentage directly from the experimental results.\n\nLooking at the results:\n- First half (E. coli B): 40 pluses.\n- Second half (E. coli K): 4 pluses.\n\nEach half represents a dilution of 1:10^n. The first half is 1:10^7, and the second is 1:10^5.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the recombination rate affects the number of plasmids detected. If the recombination rate is high, more plasmids will be recombinant, leading to more pluses.\n\nSuppose the recombination rate is r. Then, the expected number of plasmids on each lawn would be proportional to r. However, since each sample is a different dilution, the absolute numbers depend on the initial concentrations.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the ratio of plasmids detected in each sample. Since the first sample is more dilute (higher concentration), and the second is less dilute (lower concentration), the relative plasmids would depend inversely on the dilution factor.\n\nFor the first sample (1:10^7):\nNumber of plasmids detected = 40.\n\nFor the second sample (1:10^5):\nNumber of plasmids detected = 4.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids in the first sample to the second is 40 : 4 = 10:1, which suggests that the first sample had ten times more plasmids than the second. Given that the first sample is 10^7 times higher in concentration than the second (since 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), this aligns with the idea that the recombination rate is consistent across samples.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate is likely around 1% because the plasmids detected are relatively few compared to the total available, indicating moderate recombination activity.\n\nWait, but let me test this reasoning. If recombination occurred at 1%, then in a large population, a significant proportion of the phages would be recombinant. However, in the presence of multiple mutants, the recombination might occur even at lower rates because the selection pressure favors certain configurations.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plasmids detected is proportional to the product of the recombination rate and the dilution factor. So, plasmids detected \u221d r * (1/dilution factor).\n\nIn the first sample (1:10^7), plasmids detected = 40 = r * 10^7.\n\nIn the second sample (1:10^5), plasmids detected = 4 = r * 10^5.\n\nSolving for r in both cases:\n\nFrom first sample: r = 40 / 10^7 = 4e-6.\n\nFrom second sample: r = 4 / 10^5 = 4e-5.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here because the recombination rate should be constant across samples. This suggests that my assumption is incorrect, and perhaps the recombination rate isn't exactly the same in both samples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is applied differently. Maybe the plasmids are selected based on their ability to replicate, which could depend on the number of times they've been selected for recombination.\n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the probability that a phage is recombinant is approximately r. Therefore, the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to r multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nWait, but in reality, the probability of a phage being recombinant is r, so the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to r * (dilution factor - 1).\n\nIn the first sample (1:10^7), the number of plasmids detected is 40. Assuming that each plasmid has a probability r of being selected for recombination, the expected number of plasmids would be r * (10^7 - 1) \u2248 r * 10^7.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample, it's r * 10^5.\n\nSetting up equations:\n\n40 \u2248 r * 10^7 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-6.\n\n4 \u2248 r * 10^5 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-5.\n\nThis inconsistency implies that my model is flawed. Perhaps the recombination doesn't happen uniformly across all replication attempts. Instead, it might follow a different mechanism, like interference or other factors affecting the selection pressure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination rate is applied multiplicatively. Suppose the recombination rate is r, then the probability that a phage is recombinant is r, and the effective selection pressure reduces the number of plasmids.\n\nIn that case, the number of plasmids detected would decrease exponentially with the dilution factor. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to apply.\n\nGiven the options provided (from 0.02% to 0.5%), and considering that the recombination rate is low enough that only a small fraction of phages are recombinant, the answer is likely option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Considering that 0.5% is closer to the calculated value based on the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the probabilities:\n\nIn the first sample, 40 plasmids detected out of a possible 1e7. So the probability per plasmid is 40/(1e7) = 4e-6.\n\nIn the second sample, 4 plasmids out of 1e5, so probability per plasmid is 4e-5.\n\nSince the recombination rate should be the same, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results. Maybe the plasmids detected are proportional to the square root of the dilution factor or something else, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is applied in a way that the number of plasmids detected scales linearly with the dilution factor, implying a much lower recombination rate. But none of the options go below 0.02%.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are 0.02% to 0.5%. So 0.5% seems plausible if the recombination rate is about 5e-3 (0.05%).\n\nBut earlier calculations suggested 4e-6, which is 0.0004%, which is much lower than any of the options. This contradiction suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the number of plasmids detected is related to the number of viable phages, which depends on the number of times they've been selected for recombination. If the recombination rate is r, then the probability that a phage remains viable is approximately e^{-r} (using the approximation for rare events). However, this assumes independent events, which may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is r, the expected number of plasmids detected would be proportional to r multiplied by the dilution factor. Thus:\n\nFirst sample: 40 = k * r * 1e7.\n\nSecond sample: 4 = k * r * 1e5.\n\nDividing the first equation by the second gives 10 = 1e7 / 1e5 = 100, which implies 10 = 100k*r, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, solving for k and r:\n\nFrom first: 40 = k * r * 1e7 \u21d2 k*r=4e-6.\n\nFrom second: 4 = k*r*1e5 \u21d2 k*r=4e-5.\n\nAgain, inconsistency arises because k*r cannot be both 4e-6 and 4e-5. This indicates that the model is incorrect or incomplete.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that the observed plasmids are a result of the selection pressure favoring certain combinations. If the recombination rate is r, then the number of plasmids detected would scale with the dilution factor. So, the observed number of plasmids N is proportional to r * (1/dilution factor).\n\nThus, for the first sample (1:1e7):\n\nN1 = r * (1/1e7) \u21d2 40 = r * 1e-7 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e6.\n\nBut this is impossible because r must be less than 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted it. Maybe N1 = r * (1/dilution factor), so:\n\n40 = r * (1/1e7) \u21d2 r = 4e7.\n\nThat's way too high. Clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: The number of plasmids detected is proportional to the product of the recombination rate and the dilution factor. So,\n\nN1 = r * (1/d1)\n\nN2 = r * (1/d2)\n\nWhere d1 and d2 are the dilution factors.\n\nGiven N1 = 40, N2 = 4,\n\nWe have:\n\n40 = r * (1/1e7) \u21d2 r = 4e7.\n\n4 = r * (1/1e5) \u21d2 r = 4e5.\n\nAgain, inconsistent values for r. This suggests that the model is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct relation is N1 = r * (d2/d1), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the plasmids are selected based on the number of times they have been replicated, and each replication attempt has a chance of recombination. So, the number of plasmids detected would be proportional to the number of successful replication attempts, which depends on the recombination rate.\n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the probability of a successful replication without recombination is (1 - r)^n, where n is the number of replication attempts. However, without knowing n, this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I'll make an educated guess based on the options and the trend. The first sample shows a much higher number of plasmids detected (40) than the second (4). This suggests that the recombination rate is lower in the first sample because the dilution factor is larger, meaning there are more plasmids to detect. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is the same, the smaller dilution factor would yield fewer plasmids, which matches the data.\n\nIf the recombination rate is consistent, then r * (1/dilution factor) should give similar values. However, in our previous calculation, it led to inconsistencies. Perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination rate is very low, making the difference in plasmid counts manageable.\n\nConsidering that the options include 0.5%, which is roughly the square root of 0.025%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.5%, then:\n\nFor the first sample: 40 plasmids = 0.5% * 1e7 \u21d2 40 = 0.005 * 1e7 \u21d2 40 = 5e5 \u21d2 No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids detected is equal to the recombination rate multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nSo, N = r * D.\n\nThen,\n\n40 = r * 1e7 \u21d2 r = 4e-6.\n\n4 = r * 1e5 \u21d2 r = 4e-5.\n\nAgain, inconsistency. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the observed number of plasmids is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should look for patterns. The first sample has 40 plasmids, which is 10 times more than the second sample (4). If the recombination rate is consistent, then:\n\n40 = r * 1e7 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-6.\n\n4 = r * 1e5 \u21d2 r \u2248 4e-5.\n\nBut this doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is the same, and the observed plasmids are reduced by the dilution factor. So:\n\nr = 40 / (1e7 * something).\n\nBut I'm stuck, so I'll make an educated guess. Looking at the options, 0.5% is close to the 0.005% implied by the first sample (40 plasmids detected in 1e7 dilution). So, 0.5% makes sense.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

In this case, the number of recombinants on strain B (plasmids from strain B) is 40, and on strain K (wild-type) is 4. So, the ratio is 40/4 = 10 times higher.

When the other half is plated on strain K, four pluses appear there too. So each strain has four cases where a phage caused a problem.\n\nNow, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to how different alleles from different sources combine. In this case, each mutation comes from the same T_4 phage type, so if they're recombined, their effects would be additive or synergistic.\n\nIn the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage worked, leading to half the cells being lysed. That suggests that the lysogenic phage carries its own mutation, perhaps at a certain site.\n\nWhen both types are present, half the cells are lysed, and then those cells are plated on strain K. The number of pluses depends on whether the lysogenic phage's mutation was present in these cells. If the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that isn't present in the lysogenic phage type itself, maybe through recombination, the effect would differ.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage type shouldn't have mutations; it's already lysogenic. So any recombination would come from within the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the presence of recombination would affect the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with another mutation, it might either enhance or reduce replication efficiency. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should still work as before. If there's some recombination, the lysogenic phage might not replicate as effectively, leading to fewer plasmids and thus less lysis.\n\nBut wait, the initial experiment shows that without lysogenic phage, strain B is half-satiated.

Let me read again.\n\n\"In a plate of E. coli strain B, infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nSo the total population after both experiments is split into two halves. One half is plated on strain B, expecting more plasmids due to higher dilution. The other half is plated on strain K.\n\nAfter several generations, the number of plasmids detected is 4 on strain B and 40 on strain K.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage type (which usually doesn't have mutations) must be carrying a mutation that allows it to replicate better or worse. But since both mutants are present, maybe the combination affects replication.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation that reduces its replication efficiency, then when both types are present, the lysogenic phage might replicate less efficiently, causing fewer plasmids and thus fewer lysis events.\n\nAlternatively, if there's recombination between the lysogenic phage's replication machinery and another mutation, it could affect the overall efficiency.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we look at the difference in plasmid counts between the two plating batches. Strain B had 4 plasmids, while strain K had 40. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's replication was reduced, leading to fewer plasmids.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids on K is much higher than on B, indicating that the lysogenic phage replicated fewer times on K. If recombination occurred, it would explain why the lysogenic phage didn't replicate as well on K, leading to fewer plasmids.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as (1 - e^{-2p}), where p is the allele frequency.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets half-satiated, meaning half the cells are lysed, and then those cells are plated again on another strain K.\n\nThe results show that when half the culture is plated on strain B, there are four pluses. When the other half is plated on strain K, four pluses appear there too. So each strain has four cases where a phage caused a problem.\n\nNow, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to how different alleles from different sources combine. In this case, each mutation comes from the same T_4 phage type, so if they're recombined, their effects would be additive or synergistic.\n\nIn the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage worked, leading to half the cells being lysed. That suggests that the lysogenic phage carries its own mutation, perhaps at a certain site.\n\nWhen both types are present, half the cells are lysed, and then those cells are plated on strain K. The number of pluses depends on whether the lysogenic phage's mutation was present in these cells. If the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that isn't present in the lysogenic phage type itself, maybe through recombination, the effect would differ.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage type shouldn't have mutations; it's already lysogenic. So any recombination would come from within the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the presence of recombination would affect the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with another mutation, it might either enhance or reduce replication efficiency. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should still work as before. If there's some recombination, the lysogenic phage might not replicate as effectively, leading to fewer plasmids and thus less lysis.\n\nBut wait, the initial experiment shows that without lysogenic phage, strain B is half-satiated. With both types, it's quarter-satiated. Wait, no\u2014the initial statement says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again.\n\n\"In a plate of E. coli strain B, infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nSo the total population after both experiments is split into two halves. One half is plated on strain B, expecting more plasmids due to higher dilution. The other half is plated on strain K.\n\nAfter several generations, the number of plasmids detected is 4 on strain B and 40 on strain K.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage type (which usually doesn't have mutations) must be carrying a mutation that allows it to replicate better or worse. But since both mutants are present, maybe the combination affects replication.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation that reduces its replication efficiency, then when both types are present, the lysogenic phage might replicate less efficiently, causing fewer plasmids and thus fewer lysis events.\n\nAlternatively, if there's recombination between the lysogenic phage's replication machinery and another mutation, it could affect the overall efficiency.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we look at the difference in plasmid counts between the two plating batches. Strain B had 4 plasmids, while strain K had 40. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's replication was reduced, leading to fewer plasmids.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids on K is much higher than on B, indicating that the lysogenic phage replicated fewer times on K. If recombination occurred, it would explain why the lysogenic phage didn't replicate as well on K, leading to fewer plasmids.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as (1 - e^{-2p}), where p is the allele frequency.

This means some of them might still be lysed and replicate. On the other half, which is less diluted (1:10^5), they're more likely to have lived enough to replicate normally without causing any issues because there's already some lysogeny.\n\nThe results show four pluses on K and 40 on B. I think this relates to the number of recombinant phages. Recombination would mean that the two mutations are on the same chromosome. If they were independent, we'd expect fewer recombinations. Since here we see some, maybe around 4-40 pluses, let's work that into calculations.\n\nIf the two mutations were independent, the expected number would be low. But since we have some pluses, it suggests that the mutations are linked or very close together. To calculate the percentage of recombination, I'll use the formula for genetic distance, which is the ratio of observed recombinant alleles to the total possible. In this case, each parent contributes one allele, so the total possible recombinants are 1/4 (since two chromosomes).\n\nWait, actually, the calculation should consider the fraction of offspring that have one mutation from each parent. So if R is the observed recombinants, then the genetic distance is R/(total possible). Here, total possible is 1/4, so if we have R pluses, the frequency would be R / (1/4) = 4R. But I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach.\n\nEach positive on K indicates a recombinant phage. Since both types of phages are present, the chance of a phage carrying both mutations is what matters. If they are linked, the probability is about 1%, otherwise it's much lower. Given the data shows some pluses, it must be a small recombination rate.\n\nUsing the formula, the expected number of recombinant pluses would be approximately (1/4)*total pluses. So if we have 4 on K, the expected recombinants would be (1/4)*4=1. But wait, the actual count is 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a certain number of recombinants. The correct approach is to calculate the genetic distance as the proportion of recombinant offspring over the total. Each parent provides a haplotype, so the recombinant would be when one comes from each parent.\n\nIn this case, the test cross is between a heterozygote (from the lysogenic phage) and a wild type. The expected recombinant offspring would be 1/4 of the total. However, the observed number is higher, suggesting linkage.\n\nBut looking at the data, the K strain has 4 pluses, and B has 40. The total number of plasmids is 80, right? Wait, no, each plate has 1 million cells, so dilutions are involved. Maybe I should think in terms of the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAnother way: The probability of a recombinant plasmid is 1 - (1/4)^2 = 15/16 \u2248 93%. But that seems high. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (number of plasmids) * (1/4). For example, if you plate 1e6 cells, and each produces one plasmid, then 25% would carry one mutation from each parent. But given that the numbers don't fit exactly, maybe I need to reverse-engineer.\n\nWait, the total plasmids on B plates: 40 on B and 4 on K. Total plasmids per plate: 44. Number of plasmids per cell: 1e6 / 1e6 = 1. So each cell has one plasmid. Thus, the number of plasmids per plate is 1e6. So the number of recombinant plasmids would be (number of recombinants) = (number of cells) * (probability of recomb). Probability is 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4? No, wait, if two genes are linked, the probability of a recombinant is 1 - 2*(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^4 = 1 - 0.5 + 0.0625 = 0.5625, which is 96.25%. That seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for recombination frequency (RF): RF = (number of recombinant gametes) / (total gametes). Since the two types are on separate chromosomes, the maximum RF is 50%. But with two mutations, the RF is the probability that a gamete gets one mutation from each parent.\n\nGiven the data, the K strain has 4 pluses, and B has 40. The total plasmids are 44. Assuming all plasmids come from either B or K, the number of recombinants would be (4 + 40)/44 * 44 = 44, which doesn't make sense.

So RF = (4 + 40) / (4 * 44) ) ? Not sure. Alternatively, RF = (number of recombinants) / (total number of gametes). If the total number of gametes is 44, and the number of recombinants is 4, then RF = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. But this isn't an option.

Half the colonies split into 1:10^7 and are plated on a strain B lawn, resulting in four pluses. The other half splits into 1:10^5 and is plated on strain K, yielding four pluses again. So, each half has four more pluses than the other, meaning the number of plasmid copies per colony increases from 10^5 to 10^7.\n\nWait, no, actually, if you have a dilution factor of 1:10^n, then the number of phages per colony is proportional to 10^n. So, for example, 1:10^5 means each colony has 10^5 phages. If you plate them on a strain B lawn, each phage would try to replicate and lyse the cells. Since only strain K is another type of phage, maybe we're looking at how these phages interact.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key here might be the concept of genetic interference or recombination. The presence of multiple mutants likely leads to a situation where certain combinations cause issues. In this case, since only strain K's mutation caused issues, it implies that the lysogenic phage must have had enough phages to cause replication but not enough for the lysogenic phage itself to lysis.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell; it just integrates into the chromosome. So, if you have two different lysogenic phages, they might interfere with each other. But if only strain K's mutation caused the issue, that suggests that the lysogenic phage was present in sufficient numbers to lyse the cells but not enough to allow the lysogenic phage to integrate.\n\nAlternatively, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, the number of plasmids per colony increases beyond what would be expected for either mutant alone. This could indicate that the phages are combining or interfering with each other, leading to a recombination event.\n\nIn genetic terms, if two identical mutations occur independently, they might lead to a recombinant mutation. However, in this case, it's about phage genes causing interference. Each phage carries its own mutation, and when present together, they might combine in a way that affects replication or integration.\n\nThe formula to calculate recombination frequency (rf) is rf = 1 - e^{-2p(1-p)}, where p is the probability of a single mutation occurring. But wait, in this context, the problem states that only strain K's mutation caused the issue. So, the presence of two mutants led to a specific outcome, indicating that only one of the mutations contributed to the issue.\n\nPerhaps the experiment measures whether the two mutants interact. If they do, it might lead to a higher chance of double mutants or a specific pattern of replication. But the result is that only one mutation (strain K) caused the issue, implying that the interaction didn't lead to a double mutant but rather that the lysogenic phage was active enough to lyse the cells despite being a mutant.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the concept of double mutant resistance. If both mutants were present, the resistance would depend on whether they interact. For instance, if two identical mutations exist, sometimes the double mutant may be more resistant than any individual, depending on their configuration.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the experiment shows that when both types are present, the number of plasmids per colony increased beyond what strain B would produce alone. That increase might suggest that the phages are combining or that the phage load is increasing due to interference. Interference occurs when the presence of one phage reduces the replication efficiency of another, often due to competition for resources like DNA or a host.\n\nIf there's recombination, it might mean that the phages' alleles have combined, leading to a new functional mutation. The number of plasmids per colony indicates how many phages are present. If each mutant contributes a certain number of phages, the total would be the sum of both.\n\nSo, if strain B is producing a certain number of plasmids, say P, then strain K's contribution would be P + x, where x is the additional plasmids due to the interaction.

The other mutant, which doesn't cause lysis, might not affect the lysogenic phage's ability to integrate or replicate.\n\nBut why would the number of plasmids per colony increase? Maybe because the lysogenic phage integrated and replicated, adding more plasmids.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains are partially lysed, which suggests some combination of their effects.\n\nThe experiment involves plates where E. coli strain B is first infected with two types of mutantphages. Half the colonies split into 1:10^7 and are plated on a strain B lawn, resulting in four pluses. The other half splits into 1:10^5 and is plated on strain K, yielding four pluses again. So, each half has four more pluses than the other, meaning the number of plasmid copies per colony increases from 10^5 to 10^7.\n\nWait, no, actually, if you have a dilution factor of 1:10^n, then the number of phages per colony is proportional to 10^n. So, for example, 1:10^5 means each colony has 10^5 phages. If you plate them on a strain B lawn, each phage would try to replicate and lyse the cells. Since only strain K is another type of phage, maybe we're looking at how these phages interact.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key here might be the concept of genetic interference or recombination. The presence of multiple mutants likely leads to a situation where certain combinations cause issues. In this case, since only strain K's mutation caused issues, it implies that the lysogenic phage must have had enough phages to cause replication but not enough for the lysogenic phage itself to lysis.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell; it just integrates into the chromosome. So, if you have two different lysogenic phages, they might interfere with each other. But if only strain K's mutation caused the issue, that suggests that the lysogenic phage was present in sufficient numbers to lyse the cells but not enough to allow the lysogenic phage to integrate.\n\nAlternatively, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, the number of plasmids per colony increases beyond what would be expected for either mutant alone. This could indicate that the phages are combining or interfering with each other, leading to a recombination event.\n\nIn genetic terms, if two identical mutations occur independently, they might lead to a recombinant mutation. However, in this case, it's about phage genes causing interference. Each phage carries its own mutation, and when present together, they might combine in a way that affects replication or integration.\n\nThe formula to calculate recombination frequency (rf) is rf = 1 - e^{-2p(1-p)}, where p is the probability of a single mutation occurring. But wait, in this context, the problem states that only strain K's mutation caused the issue. So, the presence of two mutants led to a specific outcome, indicating that only one of the mutations contributed to the issue.\n\nPerhaps the experiment measures whether the two mutants interact. If they do, it might lead to a higher chance of double mutants or a specific pattern of replication. But the result is that only one mutation (strain K) caused the issue, implying that the interaction didn't lead to a double mutant but rather that the lysogenic phage was active enough to lyse the cells despite being a mutant.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the concept of double mutant resistance. If both mutants were present, the resistance would depend on whether they interact. For instance, if two identical mutations exist, sometimes the double mutant may be more resistant than any individual, depending on their configuration.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the experiment shows that when both types are present, the number of plasmids per colony increased beyond what strain B would produce alone. That increase might suggest that the phages are combining or that the phage load is increasing due to interference. Interference occurs when the presence of one phage reduces the replication efficiency of another, often due to competition for resources like DNA or a host.\n\nIf there's recombination, it might mean that the phages' alleles have combined, leading to a new functional mutation. The number of plasmids per colony indicates how many phages are present. If each mutant contributes a certain number of phages, the total would be the sum of both.\n\nSo, if strain B is producing a certain number of plasmids, say P, then strain K's contribution would be P + x, where x is the additional plasmids due to the interaction. The fact that the count on strain K is lower than on strain B might indicate that the lysogenic phage has integrated and replicated, adding to the plasmid count, while the other mutant doesn't cause the same effect.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in the number of plasmids per colony could indicate the level of recombination.

If there's excess in one group, it might suggest more recombination or interference.\n\nGiven the data, when both mutants are present, the number of plasmids per colony increases.

The other half is diluted by 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\n\nThe results are four pluses on K and 40 on B. So, I think I need to determine how many times each mutation occurred within the same host and whether there's any interference or cross-reactivity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the scenario where all plasmids are from the lysogenic phage. Each parent cell would have one lysogenic phage. After replication, they produce two phages. One replicates, dies; the other survives. So, for each original phage, one daughter survives. If we have n such cells, the number of surviving phages would be approximately n/2. But wait, since each phage is on a separate cell, maybe the ratio depends on the number of cells.\n\nBut in reality, in a population, you'd expect about 50% of the phages to survive if they're lysogenic. However, here, some cells might be carrying both mutations, which complicates things.\n\nWait, no. In the experiment, the phages cause either lysis or lysogeny. So, in the first condition (only lysogenic), all the phages should die, causing division. When both types are present, the lysogenic ones don't divide, while the non-lysis ones do. So, the proportion of phages that don't divide (lysis) would depend on their origin.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P = probability that a randomly selected phage has the lysogenic mutation.\n- Q = probability that it carries the lysis mutation.\n\nIn the first case, only lysogenic phages are present, so none cause division. In the second case, both types are present, leading to division only in the non-lysis phages.\n\nNow, when the E. coli strain B is plated on strain B, only half the colonies divide, suggesting that half of the phages didn't lyse. These must be the lysogenic phages without the lysis mutation. Wait, but if all were lysogenic, why would some not lyse? Unless there's interference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysis mutation leads to more clonalization or increased competition, causing some phages to replicate and others to not. This could lead to incomplete segregation, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of pluses under different scenarios. Normally, if there was complete dissociation (no recombination), all lysogenic phages would not reproduce, so the number of pluses would be zero. But here, some pluses exist, indicating some recombination.\n\nGiven that when both types are present, some pluses occur on strain B and fewer on strain K, I suspect that the recombination rate affects the distribution of mutants.\n\nIf the recombination frequency (RF) is r%, then the fraction of phages with both mutations is r/(100 + r). Assuming that, let's model the situation.\n\nWhen both types are present, the total number of phages per cell would be affected by the combination of the two mutations. Phages carrying one mutation will replicate and potentially die or split, whereas those without both mutations may replicate and contribute to division.\n\nIn the first condition (only lysogenic), all phages should die, leading to division. In the second condition (both types), some phages may replicate and divide (non-lytic), while others may not.\n\nSo, the number of pluses observed on strain B would correspond to the number of non-lytic phages among the lysogenic mutants, and similarly for strain K.\n\nAssuming complete dissociation ( rf=0 ), all lysogenic phages would not divide, leading to zero pluses on strain B. But since we have some pluses, there must be recombination.\n\nThe formula relating the observed pluses to the recombination frequency is:\n\nNumber of pluses on strain B = [ (number of lysogenic phages without lysis)^2 / (total phages)^2 ] * Total pluses.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, considering the frequency of double mutants.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the fraction of phages that have both mutations is r/(100 + r). The remaining (1 - r)/(100 + r) are either single mutants or no mutations.\n\nWhen both types are present, the number of non-lytic phages would come from the single mutants (without the lysis mutation) and possibly the double mutants (which still don't lyse).\n\nWait, actually, the lysogenic phages that don't have the lysis mutation would replicate and not divide, while those without both mutations (double mutants) might also replicate and not divide.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nIn a scenario with no recombination (rf=0), all lysogenic phages would not divide, so the number of pluses on strain B would be zero. But here, four pluses are found on strain B.\n\nEach plus represents a single cell where a phage replicated successfully. Since the initial plating was on strain B, the only way a plus occurs is if a phage successfully replicated and did not lyse.\n\nSo, in the first case (only lysogenic), all phages should lyse, so no pluses. In the second case (both types present), some phages (the non-lytic ones) will replicate and not lyse.\n\nThe fraction of non-lytic phages is determined by the recombination frequency. If recombination occurs at a rate of r, then the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (100 - r)/100. Therefore, the fraction that successfully replicate and do not lyse is [(100 - r)/100]^2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, that's probably oversimplifying. Actually, the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation would be (1 - r)/(100 + r). Because recombination reduces the number of single mutants.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nTotal phages per cell: Assume N phages per cell. Some carry the lysis mutation (L), some carry the lysogenic (M), and some carry both (LM). The probabilities are as follows:\n\nP(L) = p\nP(M) = q\nP(LM) = r\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive,\n\np + q + r = 1\n\nIn the first condition (only lysogenic):\n\nPhages are M. They lyse and replicate, producing two M phages. One dies, one survives. So, each original M produces one surviving M. Thus, the number of surviving phages is N*(p/q)*(q/p) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, each M phage produces two Ms upon replication. One dies, one survives. So, the number of surviving phages is equal to the number of M phages before replication multiplied by (1 - p/M phage). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of surviving phages from a single M phage is 1. So, for N phages, the total surviving phages would be N*(1) = N, but this doesn't make sense because each M phage produces two Ms, one dies, so effectively, each M contributes one phage.\n\nThus, total survivors = N*(1) = N.\n\nWait, but that would mean all phages survive, which contradicts the idea of recombination.\n\nWait, no. When phages replicate, each M phage becomes two Ms. One dies, one survives. So, the number of Ms after replication is equal to the number of Ms before replication. Thus, the total number remains the same.\n\nTherefore, in the first condition (only lysogenic), all phages lyse and replicate, resulting in the same number of phages as before. Hence, no pluses.\n\nIn the second condition (both L and M present), the phages are LM. Upon replication, each LM phage becomes two LM phages. Now, some LM phages will lyse (one replicates, dies; one survives). Others will not lyse (both replicate, neither dies nor survives). So, the number of non-lytic phages would be (1/2)*N*(number of LM phages).\n\nWait, no. Each LM phage has a 50% chance of being replicated without lyse, thus contributing to pluses. Similarly, each L phage has a 50% chance of replicating without lyse. And each M phage has a 50% chance of replicating without lyse.\n\nSo, the number of non-lytic phages is:\n\n(0.5 * N_L) + (0.5 * N_M) + (0.5 * N_LM)\n\nWhere N_L is the number of L phages, N_M the number of M, etc.\n\nBut since we're dealing with frequencies, let's assume N_L = p*N, N_M = q*N, N_LM = r*N.\n\nThen,\n\nNon-lytic phages = 0.5*p*N + 0.5*q*N + 0.5*r*N\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.5*(p + q + r)*N = 0.5*1*N = 0.5N.\n\nBut this can't be right because if all phages are LM, then half of them would lyse, leading to half pluses. However, our experiment showed four pluses on B, and four hundred on K.\n\nWait, but in our experiment, when both types are present, some pluses are on B and fewer on K. That suggests that the recombination affects the distribution of mutants.\n\nPerhaps I should model the expectation mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet x be the frequency of the double mutant (both mutations).\n\nLet y be the frequency of the single mutant (only lysogenic).\n\nLet z be the frequency of the wild type (only lysis).\n\nWe know that x + y + z = 1.\n\nIn the absence of recombination (x=0), all y would be 1. So, all phages are single mutants.\n\nIn our experiment, when both types are present, some pluses occur on B (from non-lytic phages) and fewer on K (perhaps due to different x,y,z distributions).\n\nWait, but according to the problem, when both types are present, some pluses occur on B and fewer on K. It says four pluses on B and forty on K. Wait, that doesn't add up because total pluses should be around fifty-four, given that it's a dilution.\n\nBut perhaps I misinterpret. The plate is plated on strain B and K, so some pluses stay on B (if they came from strain B), and others move to K if they were on strain K. No, that doesn\u2019t make sense because all plasmids originate from the same pool.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about whether the phage carries the mutation affects its ability to replicate. For example, phages with both mutations might replicate faster or slower, affecting the outcome.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach.\n\nThe expected number of pluses on strain B when both types are present would depend on the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/ (1 + r). Or something like that.\n\nWait, no. Recombination rate usually refers to the percentage of recombinant chromosomes. So, if the recombination frequency is r%, then the fraction of double mutant phages is r/(100 + r). The rest are either single mutants or no mutations.\n\nWhen both types are present, the fraction of non-lytic phages would be the sum of the fractions of phages without the lysis mutation.\n\nSo, the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). Therefore, the fraction that successfully replicate and do not lyse is [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Another way to look at it is using the formula for the expected number of pluses on a strain when both types are present.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nTotal plasmid concentration = C.\n\nWhen only lysogenic, all phages lyse, so no pluses.\n\nWhen both types are present, the number of non-lytic phages per cell would be:\n\nNumber of non-lytic phages = (0.5 * (N_L + N_M + N_LM)) )\n\nBecause each L, M, and LM phage has a 50% chance of replicating without lyse.\n\nBut N_L + N_M + N_LM = N_total.\n\nSo, the number of non-lytic phages is 0.5 * N_total.\n\nSimilarly, the number of pluses on strain B would be proportional to the frequency of non-lytic phages.\n\nBut in the experiment, when both types are present, four pluses are found on B, and 40 on K. So, the ratio is 1:10.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the number of pluses on K is ten times higher than on B when both types are present. That implies that the fraction of non-lytic phages is lower on K compared to B. Which makes sense because when the phages on K are more likely to carry the mutation, but that doesn't directly explain the difference.\n\nWait, no. When both types are present, the number of non-lytic phages is fixed regardless of the strain. But the problem states that on strain B, four pluses are found, and on K, forty. That means that when both types are present, the plasmids are distributed unequally between the two strains.\n\nThat suggests that the phages preferentially replicate on B, leading to more plasmids on B and less on K. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of replication or segregation. For example, phages with both mutations might replicate faster, leading to more plasmids on B and fewer on K. Alternatively, the presence of the mutation may affect the expression of certain genes, influencing the distribution.\n\nBut this line of thinking isn't helping. Maybe I should refer back to the mathematical approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the recombination frequency is r%.\n\nThe fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). The fraction of phages without the lysogenic mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). So, the fraction that both have neither mutation is [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2.\n\nBut this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, considering that recombination reduces the frequency of single mutants, the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). Therefore, the fraction of phages that successfully replicate and do not lyse is [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2.\n\nThus, the number of pluses on strain B would be proportional to [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2.\n\nGiven that four pluses are found on B when both types are present, and 40 on K, perhaps we can set up a ratio.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the expected number of pluses on each strain when both types are present is proportional to the square of the fraction of non-lysogenic phages.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote f as the fraction of non-lysogenic phages. Then, the number of pluses on B would be proportional to f\u00b2, and on K, it would be proportional to (1 - f)\u00b2.\n\nGiven that f\u00b2 = 4 / (4 + 40) ) = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909.\n\nTaking the square root gives f \u2248 sqrt(0.0909) \u2248 0.3016.\n\nSo, f \u2248 30.16%. \n\nWhat does this f represent? It's the fraction of non-lysogenic phages, i.e., phages that do not have the lysis mutation. So, 30% are non-lysogenic, meaning that 70% carry the lysis mutation.\n\nRecombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of double mutant phages relative to the total possible combinations. So, the fraction of double mutants is f_double = 1 - (probability of only lysogenic + probability of only lysis + probability of both).\n\nAssuming that the only possibilities are:\n\n- Only lysogenic (Y)\n- Only lysis (X)\n- Both (XY)\n\nAnd that Y + X + XY = 1.\n\nWe've found that Y + X = 0.7 (since f = Y + X \u2248 0.3016, so 1 - f \u2248 0.6984, which is XY).\n\nWait, no. Wait, f is the fraction of non-lysogenic phages, which includes both single mutants (Y) and double mutants (XY). So, f = Y + XY.\n\nThus, the fraction of double mutants is XY = f - Y.\n\nBut from earlier, f = Y + XY \u2248 0.3016.\n\nAlso, the total plasmid concentration after dilution would be C * D, where D is the dilution factor. Here, D is 1e7, so the total plasmids are C * 1e7.\n\nBut I'm getting lost here. Let me try to proceed differently.\n\nFrom f \u2248 0.3016, which is the fraction of non-lysogenic phages. That means 30.16% of the phages do not have the lysis mutation, implying that 70% have it.\n\nRecombination frequency r is related to the frequency of double mutants. The formula for recombination frequency when multiple mutations are considered is complex, but a simple approximation is r = 2pq, where p and q are allele frequencies. However, this assumes no interference and two alleles.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency is the percentage of double mutants relative to the total possible.\n\nGiven that f = 0.3016, and f = Y + XY, and we want to find r.\n\nIn a two-allele system, the expected number of double mutants is (p)(q)(r), assuming random assortment and no interference. But in our case, it's three alleles: lysis (L), lysogenic (M), and double mutant (LM). So, the recombination frequency would relate to the fraction of double mutants.\n\nBut without more information, it's challenging. Perhaps the best approach is to estimate r based on f.\n\nAssuming that the only way a phage can replicate without lyse is if it's a double mutant, then the fraction of double mutants would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is the fraction of double mutants, then r \u2248 XY.\n\nFrom earlier, XY = f - Y.\n\nBut without knowing Y, it's difficult. Alternatively, assuming that the mutations are linked and the distance determines the recombination frequency, but without genetic data, this is",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli B shows a division into halves, meaning each half is diluted by 1:10^7 and then plated on a strain B lawn. The other half is diluted by 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\n\nThe results are four pluses on K and 40 on B. So, I think I need to determine how many times each mutation occurred within the same host and whether there's any interference or cross-reactivity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the scenario where all plasmids are from the lysogenic phage. Each parent cell would have one lysogenic phage. After replication, they produce two phages. One replicates, dies; the other survives. So, for each original phage, one daughter survives. If we have n such cells, the number of surviving phages would be approximately n/2. But wait, since each phage is on a separate cell, maybe the ratio depends on the number of cells.\n\nBut in reality, in a population, you'd expect about 50% of the phages to survive if they're lysogenic. However, here, some cells might be carrying both mutations, which complicates things.\n\nWait, no. In the experiment, the phages cause either lysis or lysogeny. So, in the first condition (only lysogenic), all the phages should die, causing division. When both types are present, the lysogenic ones don't divide, while the non-lysis ones do. So, the proportion of phages that don't divide (lysis) would depend on their origin.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P = probability that a randomly selected phage has the lysogenic mutation.\n- Q = probability that it carries the lysis mutation.\n\nIn the first case, only lysogenic phages are present, so none cause division. In the second case, both types are present, leading to division only in the non-lysis phages.\n\nNow, when the E. coli strain B is plated on strain B, only half the colonies divide, suggesting that half of the phages didn't lyse. These must be the lysogenic phages without the lysis mutation. Wait, but if all were lysogenic, why would some not lyse? Unless there's interference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysis mutation leads to more clonalization or increased competition, causing some phages to replicate and others to not. This could lead to incomplete segregation, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of pluses under different scenarios. Normally, if there was complete dissociation (no recombination), all lysogenic phages would not reproduce, so the number of pluses would be zero. But here, some pluses exist, indicating some recombination.\n\nGiven that when both types are present, some pluses occur on strain B and fewer on strain K, I suspect that the recombination rate affects the distribution of mutants.\n\nIf the recombination frequency (RF) is r%, then the fraction of phages with both mutations is r/(100 + r). Assuming that, let's model the situation.\n\nWhen both types are present, the total number of phages per cell would be affected by the combination of the two mutations. Phages carrying one mutation will replicate and potentially die or split, whereas those without both mutations may replicate and contribute to division.\n\nIn the first condition (only lysogenic), all phages should die, leading to division. In the second condition (both types), some phages may replicate and divide (non-lytic), while others may not.\n\nSo, the number of pluses observed on strain B would correspond to the number of non-lytic phages among the lysogenic mutants, and similarly for strain K.\n\nAssuming complete dissociation ( rf=0 ), all lysogenic phages would not divide, leading to zero pluses on strain B. But since we have some pluses, there must be recombination.\n\nThe formula relating the observed pluses to the recombination frequency is:\n\nNumber of pluses on strain B = [ (number of lysogenic phages without lysis)^2 / (total phages)^2 ] * Total pluses.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, considering the frequency of double mutants.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the fraction of phages that have both mutations is r/(100 + r). The remaining (1 - r)/(100 + r) are either single mutants or no mutations.\n\nWhen both types are present, the number of non-lytic phages would come from the single mutants (without the lysis mutation) and possibly the double mutants (which still don't lyse).\n\nWait, actually, the lysogenic phages that don't have the lysis mutation would replicate and not divide, while those without both mutations (double mutants) might also replicate and not divide.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nIn a scenario with no recombination (rf=0), all lysogenic phages would not divide, so the number of pluses on strain B would be zero. But here, four pluses are found on strain B.\n\nEach plus represents a single cell where a phage replicated successfully. Since the initial plating was on strain B, the only way a plus occurs is if a phage successfully replicated and did not lyse.\n\nSo, in the first case (only lysogenic), all phages should lyse, so no pluses. In the second case (both types present), some phages (the non-lytic ones) will replicate and not lyse.\n\nThe fraction of non-lytic phages is determined by the recombination frequency. If recombination occurs at a rate of r, then the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (100 - r)/100. Therefore, the fraction that successfully replicate and do not lyse is [(100 - r)/100]^2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, that's probably oversimplifying. Actually, the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation would be (1 - r)/(100 + r). Because recombination reduces the number of single mutants.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nTotal phages per cell: Assume N phages per cell. Some carry the lysis mutation (L), some carry the lysogenic (M), and some carry both (LM). The probabilities are as follows:\n\nP(L) = p\nP(M) = q\nP(LM) = r\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive,\n\np + q + r = 1\n\nIn the first condition (only lysogenic):\n\nPhages are M. They lyse and replicate, producing two M phages. One dies, one survives. So, each original M produces one surviving M. Thus, the number of surviving phages is N*(p/q)*(q/p) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, each M phage produces two Ms upon replication. One dies, one survives. So, the number of surviving phages is equal to the number of M phages before replication multiplied by (1 - p/M phage). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of surviving phages from a single M phage is 1. So, for N phages, the total surviving phages would be N*(1) = N, but this doesn't make sense because each M phage produces two Ms, one dies, so effectively, each M contributes one phage.\n\nThus, total survivors = N*(1) = N.\n\nWait, but that would mean all phages survive, which contradicts the idea of recombination.\n\nWait, no. When phages replicate, each M phage becomes two Ms. One dies, one survives. So, the number of Ms after replication is equal to the number of Ms before replication. Thus, the total number remains the same.\n\nTherefore, in the first condition (only lysogenic), all phages lyse and replicate, resulting in the same number of phages as before. Hence, no pluses.\n\nIn the second condition (both L and M present), the phages are LM. Upon replication, each LM phage becomes two LM phages. Now, some LM phages will lyse (one replicates, dies; one survives). Others will not lyse (both replicate, neither dies nor survives). So, the number of non-lytic phages would be (1/2)*N*(number of LM phages).\n\nWait, no. Each LM phage has a 50% chance of being replicated without lyse, thus contributing to pluses. Similarly, each L phage has a 50% chance of replicating without lyse. And each M phage has a 50% chance of replicating without lyse.\n\nSo, the number of non-lytic phages is:\n\n(0.5 * N_L) + (0.5 * N_M) + (0.5 * N_LM)\n\nWhere N_L is the number of L phages, N_M the number of M, etc.\n\nBut since we're dealing with frequencies, let's assume N_L = p*N, N_M = q*N, N_LM = r*N.\n\nThen,\n\nNon-lytic phages = 0.5*p*N + 0.5*q*N + 0.5*r*N\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.5*(p + q + r)*N = 0.5*1*N = 0.5N.\n\nBut this can't be right because if all phages are LM, then half of them would lyse, leading to half pluses. However, our experiment showed four pluses on B, and four hundred on K.\n\nWait, but in our experiment, when both types are present, some pluses are on B and fewer on K. That suggests that the recombination affects the distribution of mutants.\n\nPerhaps I should model the expectation mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet x be the frequency of the double mutant (both mutations).\n\nLet y be the frequency of the single mutant (only lysogenic).\n\nLet z be the frequency of the wild type (only lysis).\n\nWe know that x + y + z = 1.\n\nIn the absence of recombination (x=0), all y would be 1. So, all phages are single mutants.\n\nIn our experiment, when both types are present, some pluses occur on B (from non-lytic phages) and fewer on K (perhaps due to different x,y,z distributions).\n\nWait, but according to the problem, when both types are present, some pluses occur on B and fewer on K. It says four pluses on B and forty on K. Wait, that doesn't add up because total pluses should be around fifty-four, given that it's a dilution.\n\nBut perhaps I misinterpret. The plate is plated on strain B and K, so some pluses stay on B (if they came from strain B), and others move to K if they were on strain K. No, that doesn\u2019t make sense because all plasmids originate from the same pool.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about whether the phage carries the mutation affects its ability to replicate. For example, phages with both mutations might replicate faster or slower, affecting the outcome.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach.\n\nThe expected number of pluses on strain B when both types are present would depend on the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/ (1 + r). Or something like that.\n\nWait, no. Recombination rate usually refers to the percentage of recombinant chromosomes. So, if the recombination frequency is r%, then the fraction of double mutant phages is r/(100 + r). The rest are either single mutants or no mutations.\n\nWhen both types are present, the fraction of non-lytic phages would be the sum of the fractions of phages without the lysis mutation.\n\nSo, the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). Therefore, the fraction that successfully replicate and do not lyse is [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Another way to look at it is using the formula for the expected number of pluses on a strain when both types are present.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nTotal plasmid concentration = C.\n\nWhen only lysogenic, all phages lyse, so no pluses.\n\nWhen both types are present, the number of non-lytic phages per cell would be:\n\nNumber of non-lytic phages = (0.5 * (N_L + N_M + N_LM)) )\n\nBecause each L, M, and LM phage has a 50% chance of replicating without lyse.\n\nBut N_L + N_M + N_LM = N_total.\n\nSo, the number of non-lytic phages is 0.5 * N_total.\n\nSimilarly, the number of pluses on strain B would be proportional to the frequency of non-lytic phages.\n\nBut in the experiment, when both types are present, four pluses are found on B, and 40 on K. So, the ratio is 1:10.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the number of pluses on K is ten times higher than on B when both types are present. That implies that the fraction of non-lytic phages is lower on K compared to B. Which makes sense because when the phages on K are more likely to carry the mutation, but that doesn't directly explain the difference.\n\nWait, no. When both types are present, the number of non-lytic phages is fixed regardless of the strain. But the problem states that on strain B, four pluses are found, and on K, forty. That means that when both types are present, the plasmids are distributed unequally between the two strains.\n\nThat suggests that the phages preferentially replicate on B, leading to more plasmids on B and less on K. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of replication or segregation. For example, phages with both mutations might replicate faster, leading to more plasmids on B and fewer on K. Alternatively, the presence of the mutation may affect the expression of certain genes, influencing the distribution.\n\nBut this line of thinking isn't helping. Maybe I should refer back to the mathematical approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the recombination frequency is r%.\n\nThe fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). The fraction of phages without the lysogenic mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). So, the fraction that both have neither mutation is [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2.\n\nBut this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, considering that recombination reduces the frequency of single mutants, the fraction of phages without the lysis mutation is (1 - r)/(100 + r). Therefore, the fraction of phages that successfully replicate and do not lyse is [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2.\n\nThus, the number of pluses on strain B would be proportional to [(1 - r)/(100 + r)]\u00b2.\n\nGiven that four pluses are found on B when both types are present, and 40 on K, perhaps we can set up a ratio.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the expected number of pluses on each strain when both types are present is proportional to the square of the fraction of non-lysogenic phages.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote f as the fraction of non-lysogenic phages. Then, the number of pluses on B would be proportional to f\u00b2, and on K, it would be proportional to (1 - f)\u00b2.\n\nGiven that f\u00b2 = 4 / (4 + 40) ) = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909.\n\nTaking the square root gives f \u2248 sqrt(0.0909) \u2248 0.3016.\n\nSo, f \u2248 30.16%. \n\nWhat does this f represent? It's the fraction of non-lysogenic phages, i.e., phages that do not have the lysis mutation. So, 30% are non-lysogenic, meaning that 70% carry the lysis mutation.\n\nRecombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of double mutant phages relative to the total possible combinations. So, the fraction of double mutants is f_double = 1 - (probability of only lysogenic + probability of only lysis + probability of both).\n\nAssuming that the only possibilities are:\n\n- Only lysogenic (Y)\n- Only lysis (X)\n- Both (XY)\n\nAnd that Y + X + XY = 1.\n\nWe've found that Y + X = 0.7 (since f = Y + X \u2248 0.3016, so 1 - f \u2248 0.6984, which is XY).\n\nWait, no. Wait, f is the fraction of non-lysogenic phages, which includes both single mutants (Y) and double mutants (XY). So, f = Y + XY.\n\nThus, the fraction of double mutants is XY = f - Y.\n\nBut from earlier, f = Y + XY \u2248 0.3016.\n\nAlso, the total plasmid concentration after dilution would be C * D, where D is the dilution factor. Here, D is 1e7, so the total plasmids are C * 1e7.\n\nBut I'm getting lost here. Let me try to proceed differently.\n\nFrom f \u2248 0.3016, which is the fraction of non-lysogenic phages. That means 30.16% of the phages do not have the lysis mutation, implying that 70% have it.\n\nRecombination frequency r is related to the frequency of double mutants. The formula for recombination frequency when multiple mutations are considered is complex, but a simple approximation is r = 2pq, where p and q are allele frequencies. However, this assumes no interference and two alleles.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency is the percentage of double mutants relative to the total possible.\n\nGiven that f = 0.3016, and f = Y + XY, and we want to find r.\n\nIn a two-allele system, the expected number of double mutants is (p)(q)(r), assuming random assortment and no interference. But in our case, it's three alleles: lysis (L), lysogenic (M), and double mutant (LM). So, the recombination frequency would relate to the fraction of double mutants.\n\nBut without more information, it's challenging. Perhaps the best approach is to estimate r based on f.\n\nAssuming that the only way a phage can replicate without lyse is if it's a double mutant, then the fraction of double mutants would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is the fraction of double mutants, then r \u2248 XY.\n\nFrom earlier, XY = f - Y.\n\nBut without knowing Y, it's difficult. Alternatively, assuming that the mutations are linked and the distance determines the recombination frequency, but without genetic data, this is",

Let me clarify:\n\nWhen the phages are mixed together, some cells will have type A, others type B. The ones with type B cause lysis, while type A do nothing. So when you mix both types, the cells with type B would lyse their E. coli, producing new phages. These new phages could potentially cause further issues if they mutate, leading to more lysing cells.\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination experiment? Recombination refers to the mixing of different alleles within the same gene locus. In this case, the two mutations are on the same T_4 phage gene, but since they're different mutants, they must have recombined during replication.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutants are present, the outcome depends on whether they interact. If they don't recombine, they might cause different effects. However, the observed results are key here. The initial division caused half to die and half to survive. Then, when the surviving half is plated on strain B, only four die, suggesting fewer lysis events than expected. Conversely, the other half, when plated on strain K, shows more lysis (four), indicating more mutation causing death.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The original plate has half the bacteria (only one half?) dying due to the presence of mutantphages. Then, the survivors are split into two groups: one with higher dilution (1:10^7) and another with lower dilution (1:10^5). Plated on strain B, four died; on strain K, four also died. That suggests that the interaction of the two mutants affects the outcome differently depending on which strain they're tested against.\n\nIf the mutants recombine, then when the mixture is tested against strain B, it might cause fewer deaths (since some combination may kill more easily). Conversely, testing against strain K might show more deaths, possibly because the non-recombining variant works better against K.\n\nThe formula for calculating the probability of recombination is p = (p1 + p2 - q)/2, where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of the two mutations occurring independently. Alternatively, when dealing with independent assortment, the chance of recombination is roughly 1/2 of the possible interactions.\n\nGiven that the number of deaths varies depending on the strain, this suggests that the two mutations are linked, i.e., they've recombined. The key is determining the percentage of recombination.\n\nLet me consider the numbers. When the mixture is placed on strain B, four cells die. On strain K, four die too. This indicates that the interaction leads to similar outcomes, suggesting that the mutations don't interfere much. Therefore, the chance of recombination must be low enough that the effect isn't dominant.\n\nUsing the formula for recombinant frequency (RF):\n\nRF = (p1 + p2 - q)/2\n\nWhere:\n- p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation.\n- q is the probability of no recombination.\n\nAssuming p1 and p2 are small, we can approximate RF \u2248 (p1 + p2)/2.\n\nFrom the experiment, let's say that in the pure culture without any phage, 8% of cells died (as an example). But when mixed with both mutants, the death rate changes.\n\nAlternatively, considering the initial division: half the bacteria die, half survive. If both mutants act on the same cell, and they recombine, the survival might depend on the combination.\n\nLooking at the results, when the cells die on strain B, it suggests that the mutation from strain B caused death. Similarly, when the cells die on strain K, the mutation from strain K caused death. If the two mutations didn't recombine, the effect would be additive. If they did recombine, the combined mutation might be less effective.\n\nSince the same number of cells die in both strains, this implies that the mutations caused the same kind of response, suggesting minimal interference. Therefore, the recombination is likely very low.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the equation:\n\nRecombination Frequency (Rf) = (Probability of first mutation + Probability of second mutation - Probability of neither mutation)/2\n\nAssuming Rf is small, the probabilities are negligible compared to each other. So approximately:\n\nRf \u2248 (p1 + p2)/2\n\nIf we assume that in the pure culture, 8% of cells died, then p1 \u2248 p2 \u2248 4%.

If they partially affect each other, the death rate would vary.\n\nGiven that four cells die on both strains, it suggests that the two mutations are interacting in a way that doesn't significantly increase or decrease the death rate beyond what would happen if each mutated cell individually caused death.\n\nThis points towards a low recombination frequency.

Since the correct answer choices are around 0%, looking back at the options, D is 0.1% and E is 0.2%.\n\nIf I take the death rates as percentages, say 16% (which is 0.16), then applying the formula:\n\nRf \u2248 (p1 + p2)/2\n\nIf p1 + p2 \u2248 2 * Rf, then:\n\np1 + p2 \u2248 2 * 0.0016 = 0.0032 or 0.32%\n\nWhich matches closely with option D (0.1%) or E (0.2%).\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is approximately 0.1% to 0.2%, corresponding to options D and E.\n\nBetween these, 0.1% is closer to 0.16% (if death rate is 16%), so perhaps the answer is D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). Depending on exact calculations, but given the options, D seems more accurate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. I think plumes mean colonies that have taken up the phage DNA, indicating successful infection.\n\nSo, the key here is figuring out how much recombination happened between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occurred at different sites within the T_4 genome or if they're at the same site.

However, another approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. If both mutations are rare, the frequency of recombination is approximately p*q.

But across all colonies, how does that translate?\n\nActually, if the entire population has a certain number of recombinants, the overall recombination frequency would depend on the proportion of recombinant plumes relative to the total plumes.

One half is dilated 1:10^7 (so a lot more cells) and plated on strain B, resulting in four plumes. The other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, yielding four plumes. \n\nFrom what I remember, when multiple mutants are present, their effects depend on whether they recombine. If there's no recombination, each mutant will cause different outcomes. Recombination would mean that some cells take up both mutations, either activating or inactivating them differently.\n\nIn the first case, only lysogenic phages are present, so all E. coli should die. However, four plumes appear, meaning some survived. This suggests that at least some cells have taken up the mutation from the lysogenic phage. \n\nIn the second case, only the lytic phage is present, leading to death. But four plumes still appeared, indicating some cells were affected here too. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense if there's no recombination because both lysogenic and lytic phages should affect different cells. So if there's recombination, some cells might take up both mutations. But how does that lead to survival?\n\nOh, right! If the lysogenic phage takes up the mutation (like a resistance gene), it can lyse the E. coli. But if it also has a mutation that inhibits recombination, maybe it doesn't take it up? Or perhaps the presence of another mutation allows for recombination without actually causing issues. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants leads to incomplete recombination. When the lysogenic phage has a mutation that inhibits recombination, it can't take up the lytic phage's mutation. So only the lysogenic phage can lyse, and the lytic one doesn't. Similarly, the lytic phage cannot take up the lysogenic mutation, so it dies.\n\nBut in the experiment, both types of phages caused some surviving cells. So perhaps when the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to take up the lytic phage's mutation during recombination, then some cells end up taking both mutations. But wait, that wouldn't explain why the lysogenic phage alone didn't kill all cells\u2014unless it could somehow lyse even with the recombined mutation.\n\nWait, no. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that prevents recombination, then it can't take up the lytic phage's mutation. So only the lysogenic phage can lyse, and the lytic one dies. That explains why in the first plate (only lysogenic), some cells survived (plumes), while in the second plate (only lytic), none survived except maybe if the lysogenic took up the lytic's mutation through recombination, but that seems unlikely unless the lysogenic has a mutation that allows it to do so.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another way: the number of plumes depends on how many cells took up the mutations. Each plume indicates a successful infection. So, when both mutants are present, some cells have taken up both, leading to incomplete recombination. But how does that affect survival?\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to take up the lytic phage's mutation during recombination, then some cells might have both mutations. But since the lysogenic phage is supposed to lyse, maybe those cells don't survive as much. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage should lyse regardless, but the lytic one shouldn't. Maybe the lysogenic phage, having the recombination mutation, can't lyse effectively because it can't combine its own mutation. Or vice versa.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the expected numbers under perfect recombination versus no recombination. Under perfect recombination, all cells would take up both mutations. But in reality, only some cells do. So the distribution of plumes would be skewed towards fewer plumes overall, meaning fewer cells have both mutations. Alternatively, if there's no recombination, only cells that take up the lysogenic mutation would lyse, while those that take up the lytic wouldn't. But in our experiment, when only lysogenic was present, some cells survived, implying some had both mutations. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps when both mutants are present, some cells take up both, but due to the presence of both, they can't lyse effectively because the lysogenic phage's mutation prevents recombination. So the lysogenic phage can't lyse despite being present, hence some cells die. Similarly, the lytic phage isn't affected because it's only using its own mutation. But in our experiment, neither type alone killed all cells; instead, both together allowed some cells to survive. \n\nMaybe the key is that when both mutants are present, some cells have taken up both mutations, which causes incomplete recombination. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to recombine with the lytic phage during recombination, then some cells take up both. Since the lysogenic phage is supposed to lyse, maybe it doesn't lyse effectively because it can't combine its mutation. Therefore, only the cells that take up the lytic phage mutation survive. But in the experiment, both types are present, so perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to how many cells have taken up the mutations.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the data:\n\n- Plate 1: Dilation 1:10^7, Plated on B. 4 plumes.\n- Plate 2: Dilation 1:10^5, Plated on K. 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming dilution affects the probability of infection, higher dilution means lower chance of a random cell taking up the mutation. So a higher dilution rate (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5) would mean lower likelihood of cells taking up the mutation.\n\nIf we consider that the number of plumes reflects the number of cells that took up the mutations, then:\n\n- Plate 1: 4 plumes, which implies 4 cells took up both mutations. But considering dilution, these cells must have been rare enough to take up both mutations. \n- Plate 2: 4 plumes, same logic applies.\n\nBut how does this relate to the percentage of recombination? Maybe the number of plumes tells us how many cells have taken up the combined mutations, which relates to the extent of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of genetic interference or interference in recombination. If there's no recombination, then only cells with lysogenic mutations would lyse. With recombination, some cells may take up both, but not fully lyse.\n\nGiven the data, if there's no recombination, the presence of both mutants would kill all cells because the lysogenic phage would lyse regardless. But in reality, both types were present and resulted in some survivors. That suggests that recombination occurred, allowing some cells to take up both mutations without full lyse.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency. The expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the frequency of recombination. If we assume that each mutation contributes independently, the probability of recombination between the two mutations would determine the number of plumes observed.\n\nIn plate 1, 4 plumes. Assuming that the total number of cells is similar across plates (due to dilution), the number of plumes correlates with the proportion of cells that have both mutations.\n\nSimilarly, in plate 2, 4 plumes again. But the dilation is less severe (1:10^5), suggesting that the number of cells that have both mutations is slightly higher than in plate 1. But both have the same number of plumes.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I should use the formula for the number of recombinant plumes. The number of recombinant plumes N is given by:\n\nN = n * (p1 * p2)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of cells plated,\n- p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring per cell.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently, the expected number of recombinant cells would be n * p1 * p2.\n\nBut how does this help? We need to find the percentage of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that have both mutations. So, if in plate 1, 4 plumes correspond to 4 cells, and in plate 2, 4 plumes correspond to 4 cells, but with a higher dilution rate, implying lower probability of recombination, perhaps the recombination frequency is low.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: calculate the expected number of plumes assuming perfect recombination and see how it deviates from the actual number.\n\nUnder perfect recombination, all cells would take up both mutations. Thus, all cells would lyse, leading to zero plumes. But in reality, some cells have both mutations, but due to the presence of both mutants, some cells don't lyse as effectively, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both mutants are present, and recombination happens, the number of plumes would increase because more cells have both mutations. But in our case, the number of plumes is the same in both plates, which suggests that the recombination frequency is low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes indicates the fraction of cells that have both mutations. If plate 1 has 4 plumes and plate 2 has 4 plumes, but the dilution rates differ, it suggests that the number of plumes increases with lower dilution rates, meaning more cells have both mutations.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to increased susceptibility, but I'm not certain.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the frequency of cells that have both mutations. If the recombination frequency is high, more cells have both mutations, leading to more plumes. Conversely, low recombination frequency would result in fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that in both dilutions, the number of plumes is the same (4 each), it suggests that the recombination frequency is low, perhaps around 0.5% or 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A. 1 percent, B. 2 percent, C. 1.5 percent, D. 0.1 percent, E. 0.2 percent, F. 0.3 percent, G. 0.5 percent, H. 5 percent, I. 0.02 percent, J. 0.05 percent, K. 0.0002 percent, L. 0.0005 percent, etc.\n\nSince the answer choices are in percentages, and the plume count is consistent, the most likely is option A (1%) or possibly option K (0.02%). Given that plumes are counted as whole numbers, 4 plumes might suggest a 1% frequency because 4/100=0.04, but this is just an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the probability of recombination is 0.02%, then 100,000 cells would have 2 plumes on average. But we have 100,000 cells in each plate, so 4 plumes would imply 4/100,000=0.004%, which is 0.004%. But this doesn't match any exact options, so perhaps 0.02% is closer.\n\nWait, the options are in whole percentages, so 1% would give 10 plumes, but we have 4. So maybe 0.5%? No, that would give 5 plumes. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the number of cells. For example, if you have n cells, the number of plumes scales as sqrt(n). But I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely related to the product of the probabilities. If p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring, then the expected number of recombinants would be n * p1 * p2. So if we have n=10^6 cells, and p1=p2=0.01, then expected recombinants would be 10^6 * 0.01 * 0.01 = 100 plumes. But in our case, we have 4 plumes in both dilutions, which suggests a very low recombination frequency.\n\nSo if 4 plumes correspond to a recombination frequency of, say, 0.02%, then the expected number of plumes would be higher. This is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps I should think about it differently. The number of plumes is equal to the number of cells that have both mutations. If the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of such cells would be the number of cells times the probability of recombination, which is r*(1 - r), but assuming r is small, it approximates to r.\n\nBut I'm not confident in this approach. Maybe I should go with the closest option, which is 1% or 0.02%. Since 0.02% gives a smaller number of plumes, but our data shows 4 plumes, which is quite high for 0.02% (since 0.02% of 10^6 is 2 plumes).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is 1%, corresponding to 10 plumes. But the data shows 4 plumes. So maybe I'm off track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is directly proportional to the recombination frequency multiplied by the dilution factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with option A: 1 percent, as it's the highest among the lowest percentages, and 4 plumes might indicate a moderate recombination frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Another way: the number of plumes depends on how many cells took up the mutations. Each plume indicates a successful infection. So, when both mutants are present, some cells have taken up both, leading to incomplete recombination. But how does that affect survival?\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to take up the lytic phage's mutation during recombination, then some cells might have both mutations. But since the lysogenic phage is supposed to lyse, maybe those cells don't survive as much. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage should lyse regardless, but the lytic one shouldn't. Maybe the lysogenic phage, having the recombination mutation, can't lyse effectively because it can't combine its own mutation. Or vice versa.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the expected numbers under perfect recombination versus no recombination. Under perfect recombination, all cells would take up both mutations. But in reality, only some cells do. So the distribution of plumes would be skewed towards fewer plumes overall, meaning fewer cells have both mutations. Alternatively, if there's no recombination, only cells that take up the lysogenic mutation would lyse, while those that take up the lytic wouldn't. But in our experiment, when only lysogenic was present, some cells survived, implying some had both mutations. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps when both mutants are present, some cells take up both, but due to the presence of both, they can't lyse effectively because the lysogenic phage's mutation prevents recombination. So the lysogenic phage can't lyse despite being present, hence some cells die. Similarly, the lytic phage isn't affected because it's only using its own mutation. But in our experiment, neither type alone killed all cells; instead, both together allowed some cells to survive. \n\nMaybe the key is that when both mutants are present, some cells have taken up both mutations, which causes incomplete recombination. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to recombine with the lytic phage during recombination, then some cells take up both. Since the lysogenic phage is supposed to lyse, maybe it doesn't lyse effectively because it can't combine its mutation. Therefore, only the cells that take up the lytic phage mutation survive. But in the experiment, both types are present, so perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to how many cells have taken up the mutations.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the data:\n\n- Plate 1: Dilation 1:10^7, Plated on B. 4 plumes.\n- Plate 2: Dilation 1:10^5, Plated on K. 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming dilution affects the probability of infection, higher dilution means lower chance of a random cell taking up the mutation. So a higher dilution rate (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5) would mean lower likelihood of cells taking up the mutation.\n\nIf we consider that the number of plumes reflects the number of cells that took up the mutations, then:\n\n- Plate 1: 4 plumes, which implies 4 cells took up both mutations. But considering dilution, these cells must have been rare enough to take up both mutations. \n- Plate 2: 4 plumes, same logic applies.\n\nBut how does this relate to the percentage of recombination? Maybe the number of plumes tells us how many cells have taken up the combined mutations, which relates to the extent of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of genetic interference or interference in recombination. If there's no recombination, then only cells with lysogenic mutations would lyse. With recombination, some cells may take up both, but not fully lyse.\n\nGiven the data, if there's no recombination, the presence of both mutants would kill all cells because the lysogenic phage would lyse regardless. But in reality, both types were present and resulted in some survivors. That suggests that recombination occurred, allowing some cells to take up both mutations without full lyse.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency. The expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the frequency of recombination. If we assume that each mutation contributes independently, the probability of recombination between the two mutations would determine the number of plumes observed.\n\nIn plate 1, 4 plumes. Assuming that the total number of cells is similar across plates (due to dilution), the number of plumes correlates with the proportion of cells that have both mutations.\n\nSimilarly, in plate 2, 4 plumes again. But the dilation is less severe (1:10^5), suggesting that the number of cells that have both mutations is slightly higher than in plate 1. But both have the same number of plumes.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I should use the formula for the number of recombinant plumes. The number of recombinant plumes N is given by:\n\nN = n * (p1 * p2)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of cells plated,\n- p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring per cell.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently, the expected number of recombinant cells would be n * p1 * p2.\n\nBut how does this help? We need to find the percentage of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that have both mutations. So, if in plate 1, 4 plumes correspond to 4 cells, and in plate 2, 4 plumes correspond to 4 cells, but with a higher dilution rate, implying lower probability of recombination, perhaps the recombination frequency is low.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: calculate the expected number of plumes assuming perfect recombination and see how it deviates from the actual number.\n\nUnder perfect recombination, all cells would take up both mutations. Thus, all cells would lyse, leading to zero plumes. But in reality, some cells have both mutations, but due to the presence of both mutants, some cells don't lyse as effectively, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both mutants are present, and recombination happens, the number of plumes would increase because more cells have both mutations. But in our case, the number of plumes is the same in both plates, which suggests that the recombination frequency is low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes indicates the fraction of cells that have both mutations. If plate 1 has 4 plumes and plate 2 has 4 plumes, but the dilution rates differ, it suggests that the number of plumes increases with lower dilution rates, meaning more cells have both mutations.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to increased susceptibility, but I'm not certain.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the frequency of cells that have both mutations. If the recombination frequency is high, more cells have both mutations, leading to more plumes. Conversely, low recombination frequency would result in fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that in both dilutions, the number of plumes is the same (4 each), it suggests that the recombination frequency is low, perhaps around 0.5% or 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A. 1 percent, B. 2 percent, C. 1.5 percent, D. 0.1 percent, E. 0.2 percent, F. 0.3 percent, G. 0.5 percent, H. 5 percent, I. 0.02 percent, J. 0.05 percent, K. 0.0002 percent, L. 0.0005 percent, etc.\n\nSince the answer choices are in percentages, and the plume count is consistent, the most likely is option A (1%) or possibly option K (0.02%). Given that plumes are counted as whole numbers, 4 plumes might suggest a 1% frequency because 4/100=0.04, but this is just an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the probability of recombination is 0.02%, then 100,000 cells would have 2 plumes on average. But we have 100,000 cells in each plate, so 4 plumes would imply 4/100,000=0.004%, which is 0.004%. But this doesn't match any exact options, so perhaps 0.02% is closer.\n\nWait, the options are in whole percentages, so 1% would give 10 plumes, but we have 4. So maybe 0.5%? No, that would give 5 plumes. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the number of cells. For example, if you have n cells, the number of plumes scales as sqrt(n). But I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely related to the product of the probabilities. If p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring, then the expected number of recombinants would be n * p1 * p2. So if we have n=10^6 cells, and p1=p2=0.01, then expected recombinants would be 10^6 * 0.01 * 0.01 = 100 plumes. But in our case, we have 4 plumes in both dilutions, which suggests a very low recombination frequency.\n\nSo if 4 plumes correspond to a recombination frequency of, say, 0.02%, then the expected number of plumes would be higher. This is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps I should think about it differently. The number of plumes is equal to the number of cells that have both mutations. If the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of such cells would be the number of cells times the probability of recombination, which is r*(1 - r), but assuming r is small, it approximates to r.\n\nBut I'm not confident in this approach. Maybe I should go with the closest option, which is 1% or 0.02%. Since 0.02% gives a smaller number of plumes, but our data shows 4 plumes, which is quite high for 0.02% (since 0.02% of 10^6 is 2 plumes).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is 1%, corresponding to 10 plumes. But the data shows 4 plumes. So maybe I'm off track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is directly proportional to the recombination frequency multiplied by the dilution factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with option A: 1 percent, as it's the highest among the lowest percentages, and 4 plumes might indicate a moderate recombination frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E.",
    "chunk_resampled": "coli strains are halved, meaning each type is used in equal amounts.",
    "rollout": " coli strains are halved, meaning each type is used in equal amounts.\n\nSo, the first test is where E. coli strain B is plated with two types of mutantphages: one causing lysogenic fission and the other causing lytic fission. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, half of the colonies die, and the other half survive. This tells me that at least some of the lysogenic phage is working, but there's also a mix of phages from different sources.\n\nNext, the survivors are split into two groups: half is dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, while the other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After incubation, four pluses are found on strain K, and 40 on B. \n\nWait, the numbers don't add up directly. If each group (dilations) has a certain number of plasmids, and plating them on different E. coli strains, the number of plasmids must be similar across all cells since the mutation should be uniform. So, if 40 plasmids are on strain B and 4 on strain K, maybe that relates to how many copies were present before dilution.\n\nBut let me think about the possible scenarios. The initial population of E. coli strain B is probably very high, so after being plated with mutants, each plating event produces many plasmids. Diluting them reduces their concentration, which might affect whether the mutation was expressed or not.\n\nIn the first experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present, half the colonies die. That suggests that the lysogenic phage successfully replicated within the E. coli, leading to lysogeny and possibly death upon lysis. However, when mixed with lytic phages, some E. coli may still replicate enough to cause death, but others may not have had time to replicate fully. But wait, no\u2014lytic phages replicate quickly and kill the bacteria, so if there's a mixture, some will die and others might survive partially.\n\nThe next part says that the survivors are split into two groups: half on strain B and half on strain K. On strain B, 40 plasmids are found; on K, 4. Assuming that the initial population is much higher than these numbers, and considering that dilution affects plasmid copy numbers, we can estimate how much of the original plasmids remain after dilution.\n\nIf the initial number of plasmids per colony is N, then after dilution by 1:10^5, the expected number would be N/1e5, and after 1:1e7, N/1e7. \n\nNow, if the number of plasmids detected on strain B is 40, and on K is 4, perhaps the ratio of plasmids corresponds to the efficiency of replication. So, strain B has more plasmids after dilution, implying that the lysogenic phage worked better in B, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, since the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission in strain B but not in strain K, the presence of lysogenic phages might indicate that the mutation (lytic fission) is present in the phage, but not in the lysogenic phage. Or perhaps the opposite.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it wouldn't affect strain B. But the lysogenic phage would cause replication within the cell, right? No, wait, lysogenic phages require T4 RNA polymerase to integrate into the bacterial genome. So, if a bacterium has lysogenic phages, it can't integrate their genes, so they won't cause replication within the cell\u2014they just replicate outside. But if a phage integrates (lytic), it replicates inside the cell, leading to lysogeny and potential death after replication.\n\nSo, in the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage is active in that strain. However, when mixed with lytic phages, some E. coli might still replicate and cause death, but others might not have time to replicate as effectively.\n\nAfter mixing, the surviving cells (plated on strain B and K) are split into two groups. On strain B, 40 plasmids are found; on strain K, 4. Let's assume that without any plating, the original population is high, say P. Then after dilution by 1:1e5, you'd expect P/1e5 plasmids per colony. Similarly for 1:1e7.\n\nLet\u2019s denote D1 as the dilution factor for the first group (1:1e7) and D2 as the second group (1:1e5).\n\nIf strain B shows 40 plasmids after dilution, and assuming the original P is much larger, then:\n\nP / D1 = 40\n\nSimilarly, P / D2 = 4\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\n(P/D1)/(P/D2) = 40/4 => D2/D1=10 => D2=10*D1\n\nSince D1=1e7 and D2=1e5, indeed 1e5 is ten times 1e6, but here D2 is 1e5, which is ten times smaller than D1=1e7. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, actually, D1 is 1:1e7, so D1=1e7. D2 is 1:1e5, so D2=1e5. Therefore, D2=D1/100.\n\nSo, according to our equation, D2/D1=10, but here D2=1e5 and D1=1e7, so D2/D1=0.1, which is 10^-1, not 10. So my earlier assumption might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the number of plasmids after dilution should reflect the efficiency of the mutation. If the lysogenic phage is active in strain B, then during the initial exposure, the plasmids replicate enough to cause death. When mixed with lytic phages, only a subset survives.\n\nAssuming that in the initial experiment, strain B has some plasmids due to its replication. When mixed with lytic phages, some plasmids replicate enough to cause death, reducing the number of surviving cells. Strain K, having no lysogenic phages, retains more plasmids.\n\nThe key is to relate the number of plasmids found after dilution to the efficiency of the mutation. Let's consider that the lysogenic phage introduced in the first experiment must have integrated into the E. coli, leading to the formation of a T4 RNA pol II vector, allowing replication inside the cell.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is mixed with lytic phages, the lysogenic phage cells can replicate inside the E. coli, potentially replicating enough to cause death. However, some cells may replicate enough to cause death, leaving fewer plasmids. Alternatively, some cells might replicate enough to cause death even when they have a T4 phage.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of lysogenic phages might mean that the T4 RNA pol II is present, allowing replication inside the cell. But if the lysogenic phage can replicate inside, then the E. coli would have plasmids even when exposed to lysogenic phages.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for recombinant DNA experiments.\n\nIn such experiments, the amount of recombinants depends on the frequency of the mutations and the efficiency of the selection. The more frequent the mutations, the more recombinants will form.\n\nGiven the data, let's suppose that the number of plasmids on strain B is 40, and on K is 4. The total plasmid count after dilution should correspond to the number of plasmids present in the initial population plus any replication events.\n\nAssuming that the initial population has a lot of plasmids, and after dilution, the proportion represents the efficiency of the mutation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote P as the initial number of plasmids per cell. After dilution by D1=1e7, the number of plasmids becomes P / D1. Similarly, after D2=1e5, it's P / D2.\n\nFrom the results:\n- For strain B: P / D1 = 40\n- For strain K: P / D2 = 4\n\nWe can solve for D1 and D2:\n\nFrom strain B: D1 = P / 40\n\nFrom strain K: D2 = P / 4\n\nWe know D1 * D2 = (P / 40) * (P / 4) ) = P\u00b2 / 160\n\nBut also, D1 * D2 = (1e7) * (1e5) = 1e12\n\nTherefore, P\u00b2 / 160 = 1e12 => P\u00b2 = 160e12 => P \u2248 sqrt(160e12) \u2248 4e8\n\nSo, P \u2248 4e8 plasmids per cell initially.\n\nThen, D1 = 4e8 / 40 \u2248 1e7, which matches D1=1e7.\n\nAnd D2 = 4e8 / 4 = 1e8, but D2 was supposed to be 1e5. Hmm, inconsistency here.\n\nWait, that suggests an error in calculation. Let me try again.\n\nWait, D1=1e7, D2=1e5.\n\nFrom strain B: P / D1 = 40 => P = 40 * D1 = 40 * 1e7 = 4e9\n\nFrom strain K: P / D2 = 4 => P = 4 * D2 = 4 * 1e5 = 4e6\n\nThese two values for P are inconsistent (4e9 vs 4e6). Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the number of plasmids found after dilution is proportional to the efficiency of the mutation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote e as the efficiency, which is the fraction of cells expressing the mutation after selection. In the first experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, half the cells die, suggesting that e = 1/2.\n\nIn the second experiment, when mixed with lytic phages, some cells die, and others may express the mutation. Suppose that the fraction of cells expressing the mutation is e' = ?\n\nIn the third experiment, only lysogenic phages are present on strain B, and they cause death. When mixed with lytic phages, the fraction of cells expressing the mutation increases to e''.\n\nThe number of plasmids after dilution depends on the efficiency of selection. Let\u2019s model this.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the number of plasmids after selection is proportional to the efficiency squared. Because in selection experiments, the efficiency of expressing a mutation is often modeled as e^2, especially when dealing with double mutants.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a single mutation. Alternatively, the number of plasmids could be related to the square root of the efficiency, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmids after selection (and dilution) is approximately proportional to the square root of the efficiency. Because the probability of survival decreases with the square root of the selection pressure.\n\nWait, let's recall that in selection experiments, the number of viable individuals is reduced by a factor proportional to the selection coefficient. If selection occurs twice (as in the case of two mutations), then the viability is reduced by the product of the selection coefficients. But in this case, we're dealing with a single mutation under varying conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids after selection is inversely proportional to the square root of the selection coefficient. So, if e is the efficiency of expression, then n = k / sqrt(e).\n\nGiven that, let's define:\n\nFor the first experiment, only lysogenic phages are present. Let's assume that e = 1/2, so n_B = k / sqrt(1/2) = k * sqrt(2)\n\nIn the second experiment, when mixed with lytic phages, let's say that e' = 1 - alpha, where alpha is the fraction of cells that die. We might not know alpha yet.\n\nBut perhaps instead, the number of plasmids after selection and dilution can help us determine the efficiency.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify.\n\nWe have two groups: half on strain B (giving 40 plasmids) and half on strain K (giving 4 plasmids). Each group was diluted 1:1e7 and 1:1e5 respectively.\n\nLet\u2019s denote N as the initial number of plasmids per cell before dilution. After dilution by D1=1e7, each group has N / 1e7 plasmids. Similarly, after D2=1e5, each group has N / 1e5 plasmids.\n\nFrom the first experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, half the cells die. So, the number of cells that survived is N / 2. These cells are then placed on strain B. Their plasmid count after dilution is (N / 2) / 1e7 = N / (2e7).\n\nWait, but in reality, the number of plasmids per cell after selection is proportional to the number of survivors. If half the cells die, only N/2 cells survive. These are then placed on strain B, and their plasmid counts are determined by the dilution factor.\n\nSo, the number of plasmids in the B group is (N / 2) * (1 / 1e7) = N / (2e7).\n\nIn the second group, half the cells survive and are placed on strain K, giving (N / 2) * (1 / 1e5) = N / (2e5).\n\nAccording to the results, the B group has 40 plasmids and the K group has 4.\n\nSo,\n\nN / (2e7) = 40 => N = 40 * 2e7 = 8e9\n\nSimilarly,\n\nN / (2e5) = 4 => N = 4 * 2e5 = 8e6\n\nAgain, inconsistency. Something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the number of plasmids after selection is equal to the number before selection multiplied by the dilution factor, regardless of survival.\n\nNo, that's not accurate. Selection removes some cells, which affects the remaining plasmids.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids after selection is proportional to the dilution factor. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that the initial population has a certain number of plasmids, N. When the cells are selected for lysogenic phages, only half survive. These N/2 cells are then placed on strain B, and their plasmid copy numbers are adjusted by the dilution factor. Similarly, the other half are placed on strain K.\n\nHowever, the exact relationship isn't clear. Maybe the key is to recognize that the number of plasmids after dilution should be consistent with the efficiency of the mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the number of recombinants (R):\n\nR = (p + q - pq) * S\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the alleles, S is the selection coefficient, and R is the number of recombinants.\n\nBut this is getting too complex without knowing the specific parameters.\n\nAlternatively, given the difficulty in calculating, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nGiven that the answer options are small percentages (like 1%, 2%, etc.), it suggests that the mutation is rare, and the number of plasmids is low. Given that, the efficiency of the mutation can be estimated.\n\nAssuming that the number of plasmids after dilution indicates the efficiency. Let's take the first scenario: when only lysogenic phages are present, half the cells die. This implies that the lysogenic phage integrated into the E. coli and started replicating inside, leading to death after replication. However, when mixed with lytic phages, some cells die due to insufficient replication capacity.\n\nIn the second experiment, the number of plasmids on strain B is 40, and on K is 4. Let's assume that the number of plasmids is proportional to the efficiency of the mutation. If the mutation is efficient, the number of plasmids should be high. Conversely, if the mutation is inefficient, the number of plasmids should be lower.\n\nLooking at the results, strain B has significantly more plasmids (40 vs 4), suggesting a more efficient mutation. However, this contradicts the idea that more plasmids imply a less efficient mutation because higher plasmid copy numbers typically indicate stronger replication.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing replication inside the E. coli, so the replication should occur faster. Thus, if the mutation is efficient, the number of plasmids should increase as more cells express the mutation.\n\nBut in our results, strain B has 40 plasmids, which is much higher than strain K's 4. So, the lysogenic phage is more efficiently expressed in strain B than in strain K.\n\nWait, but the problem states that strain B is infected by two types of mutantphages simultaneously. One causes lysogenic fission and the other causes lytic fission. Only the lysogenic phage kills the E. coli in strain B. The survivors are split into two groups, each with different selection pressures.\n\nHmm, perhaps the efficiency of the mutation is linked to the number of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage causes full replication inside the E. coli, then each replication event increases the plasmid count by one. So, if the mutation is highly efficient, the number of plasmids should be high.\n\nBut in the results, strain B has 40 plasmids, which is quite high. If the mutation is efficient, this makes sense. Strain K, having no lysogenic phages, retains fewer plasmids.\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination percentage?\n\nWait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different regions of the genome. In this context, the two mutations are in the T4 RNA pol II vector.\n\nRecombination between two mutations would involve the transfer of the T4 RNA pol II gene between the two regions. The likelihood of this happening depends on the efficiency of the selection process.\n\nThe efficiency of recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEfficiency = (f1 * f2) / (1 - f1 - f2 + f1*f2)\n\nWhere f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two mutations in the population.\n\nHowever, without knowing f1 and f2, it's challenging to compute directly. Instead, we can infer based on the plasmid numbers.\n\nEach mutation likely confers a certain level of replication stress. The efficiency of recombination is",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains are halved, meaning each type is used in equal amounts.\n\nSo, the first test is where E. coli strain B is plated with two types of mutantphages: one causing lysogenic fission and the other causing lytic fission. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, half of the colonies die, and the other half survive. This tells me that at least some of the lysogenic phage is working, but there's also a mix of phages from different sources.\n\nNext, the survivors are split into two groups: half is dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, while the other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After incubation, four pluses are found on strain K, and 40 on B. \n\nWait, the numbers don't add up directly. If each group (dilations) has a certain number of plasmids, and plating them on different E. coli strains, the number of plasmids must be similar across all cells since the mutation should be uniform. So, if 40 plasmids are on strain B and 4 on strain K, maybe that relates to how many copies were present before dilution.\n\nBut let me think about the possible scenarios. The initial population of E. coli strain B is probably very high, so after being plated with mutants, each plating event produces many plasmids. Diluting them reduces their concentration, which might affect whether the mutation was expressed or not.\n\nIn the first experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present, half the colonies die. That suggests that the lysogenic phage successfully replicated within the E. coli, leading to lysogeny and possibly death upon lysis. However, when mixed with lytic phages, some E. coli may still replicate enough to cause death, but others may not have had time to replicate fully. But wait, no\u2014lytic phages replicate quickly and kill the bacteria, so if there's a mixture, some will die and others might survive partially.\n\nThe next part says that the survivors are split into two groups: half on strain B and half on strain K. On strain B, 40 plasmids are found; on K, 4. Assuming that the initial population is much higher than these numbers, and considering that dilution affects plasmid copy numbers, we can estimate how much of the original plasmids remain after dilution.\n\nIf the initial number of plasmids per colony is N, then after dilution by 1:10^5, the expected number would be N/1e5, and after 1:1e7, N/1e7. \n\nNow, if the number of plasmids detected on strain B is 40, and on K is 4, perhaps the ratio of plasmids corresponds to the efficiency of replication. So, strain B has more plasmids after dilution, implying that the lysogenic phage worked better in B, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, since the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission in strain B but not in strain K, the presence of lysogenic phages might indicate that the mutation (lytic fission) is present in the phage, but not in the lysogenic phage. Or perhaps the opposite.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it wouldn't affect strain B. But the lysogenic phage would cause replication within the cell, right? No, wait, lysogenic phages require T4 RNA polymerase to integrate into the bacterial genome. So, if a bacterium has lysogenic phages, it can't integrate their genes, so they won't cause replication within the cell\u2014they just replicate outside. But if a phage integrates (lytic), it replicates inside the cell, leading to lysogeny and potential death after replication.\n\nSo, in the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage is active in that strain. However, when mixed with lytic phages, some E. coli might still replicate and cause death, but others might not have time to replicate as effectively.\n\nAfter mixing, the surviving cells (plated on strain B and K) are split into two groups. On strain B, 40 plasmids are found; on strain K, 4. Let's assume that without any plating, the original population is high, say P. Then after dilution by 1:1e5, you'd expect P/1e5 plasmids per colony. Similarly for 1:1e7.\n\nLet\u2019s denote D1 as the dilution factor for the first group (1:1e7) and D2 as the second group (1:1e5).\n\nIf strain B shows 40 plasmids after dilution, and assuming the original P is much larger, then:\n\nP / D1 = 40\n\nSimilarly, P / D2 = 4\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\n(P/D1)/(P/D2) = 40/4 => D2/D1=10 => D2=10*D1\n\nSince D1=1e7 and D2=1e5, indeed 1e5 is ten times 1e6, but here D2 is 1e5, which is ten times smaller than D1=1e7. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, actually, D1 is 1:1e7, so D1=1e7. D2 is 1:1e5, so D2=1e5. Therefore, D2=D1/100.\n\nSo, according to our equation, D2/D1=10, but here D2=1e5 and D1=1e7, so D2/D1=0.1, which is 10^-1, not 10. So my earlier assumption might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the number of plasmids after dilution should reflect the efficiency of the mutation. If the lysogenic phage is active in strain B, then during the initial exposure, the plasmids replicate enough to cause death. When mixed with lytic phages, only a subset survives.\n\nAssuming that in the initial experiment, strain B has some plasmids due to its replication. When mixed with lytic phages, some plasmids replicate enough to cause death, reducing the number of surviving cells. Strain K, having no lysogenic phages, retains more plasmids.\n\nThe key is to relate the number of plasmids found after dilution to the efficiency of the mutation. Let's consider that the lysogenic phage introduced in the first experiment must have integrated into the E. coli, leading to the formation of a T4 RNA pol II vector, allowing replication inside the cell.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is mixed with lytic phages, the lysogenic phage cells can replicate inside the E. coli, potentially replicating enough to cause death. However, some cells may replicate enough to cause death, leaving fewer plasmids. Alternatively, some cells might replicate enough to cause death even when they have a T4 phage.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of lysogenic phages might mean that the T4 RNA pol II is present, allowing replication inside the cell. But if the lysogenic phage can replicate inside, then the E. coli would have plasmids even when exposed to lysogenic phages.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for recombinant DNA experiments.\n\nIn such experiments, the amount of recombinants depends on the frequency of the mutations and the efficiency of the selection. The more frequent the mutations, the more recombinants will form.\n\nGiven the data, let's suppose that the number of plasmids on strain B is 40, and on K is 4. The total plasmid count after dilution should correspond to the number of plasmids present in the initial population plus any replication events.\n\nAssuming that the initial population has a lot of plasmids, and after dilution, the proportion represents the efficiency of the mutation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote P as the initial number of plasmids per cell. After dilution by D1=1e7, the number of plasmids becomes P / D1. Similarly, after D2=1e5, it's P / D2.\n\nFrom the results:\n- For strain B: P / D1 = 40\n- For strain K: P / D2 = 4\n\nWe can solve for D1 and D2:\n\nFrom strain B: D1 = P / 40\n\nFrom strain K: D2 = P / 4\n\nWe know D1 * D2 = (P / 40) * (P / 4) ) = P\u00b2 / 160\n\nBut also, D1 * D2 = (1e7) * (1e5) = 1e12\n\nTherefore, P\u00b2 / 160 = 1e12 => P\u00b2 = 160e12 => P \u2248 sqrt(160e12) \u2248 4e8\n\nSo, P \u2248 4e8 plasmids per cell initially.\n\nThen, D1 = 4e8 / 40 \u2248 1e7, which matches D1=1e7.\n\nAnd D2 = 4e8 / 4 = 1e8, but D2 was supposed to be 1e5. Hmm, inconsistency here.\n\nWait, that suggests an error in calculation. Let me try again.\n\nWait, D1=1e7, D2=1e5.\n\nFrom strain B: P / D1 = 40 => P = 40 * D1 = 40 * 1e7 = 4e9\n\nFrom strain K: P / D2 = 4 => P = 4 * D2 = 4 * 1e5 = 4e6\n\nThese two values for P are inconsistent (4e9 vs 4e6). Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the number of plasmids found after dilution is proportional to the efficiency of the mutation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote e as the efficiency, which is the fraction of cells expressing the mutation after selection. In the first experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, half the cells die, suggesting that e = 1/2.\n\nIn the second experiment, when mixed with lytic phages, some cells die, and others may express the mutation. Suppose that the fraction of cells expressing the mutation is e' = ?\n\nIn the third experiment, only lysogenic phages are present on strain B, and they cause death. When mixed with lytic phages, the fraction of cells expressing the mutation increases to e''.\n\nThe number of plasmids after dilution depends on the efficiency of selection. Let\u2019s model this.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the number of plasmids after selection is proportional to the efficiency squared. Because in selection experiments, the efficiency of expressing a mutation is often modeled as e^2, especially when dealing with double mutants.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a single mutation. Alternatively, the number of plasmids could be related to the square root of the efficiency, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmids after selection (and dilution) is approximately proportional to the square root of the efficiency. Because the probability of survival decreases with the square root of the selection pressure.\n\nWait, let's recall that in selection experiments, the number of viable individuals is reduced by a factor proportional to the selection coefficient. If selection occurs twice (as in the case of two mutations), then the viability is reduced by the product of the selection coefficients. But in this case, we're dealing with a single mutation under varying conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids after selection is inversely proportional to the square root of the selection coefficient. So, if e is the efficiency of expression, then n = k / sqrt(e).\n\nGiven that, let's define:\n\nFor the first experiment, only lysogenic phages are present. Let's assume that e = 1/2, so n_B = k / sqrt(1/2) = k * sqrt(2)\n\nIn the second experiment, when mixed with lytic phages, let's say that e' = 1 - alpha, where alpha is the fraction of cells that die. We might not know alpha yet.\n\nBut perhaps instead, the number of plasmids after selection and dilution can help us determine the efficiency.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify.\n\nWe have two groups: half on strain B (giving 40 plasmids) and half on strain K (giving 4 plasmids). Each group was diluted 1:1e7 and 1:1e5 respectively.\n\nLet\u2019s denote N as the initial number of plasmids per cell before dilution. After dilution by D1=1e7, each group has N / 1e7 plasmids. Similarly, after D2=1e5, each group has N / 1e5 plasmids.\n\nFrom the first experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, half the cells die. So, the number of cells that survived is N / 2. These cells are then placed on strain B. Their plasmid count after dilution is (N / 2) / 1e7 = N / (2e7).\n\nWait, but in reality, the number of plasmids per cell after selection is proportional to the number of survivors. If half the cells die, only N/2 cells survive. These are then placed on strain B, and their plasmid counts are determined by the dilution factor.\n\nSo, the number of plasmids in the B group is (N / 2) * (1 / 1e7) = N / (2e7).\n\nIn the second group, half the cells survive and are placed on strain K, giving (N / 2) * (1 / 1e5) = N / (2e5).\n\nAccording to the results, the B group has 40 plasmids and the K group has 4.\n\nSo,\n\nN / (2e7) = 40 => N = 40 * 2e7 = 8e9\n\nSimilarly,\n\nN / (2e5) = 4 => N = 4 * 2e5 = 8e6\n\nAgain, inconsistency. Something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the number of plasmids after selection is equal to the number before selection multiplied by the dilution factor, regardless of survival.\n\nNo, that's not accurate. Selection removes some cells, which affects the remaining plasmids.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids after selection is proportional to the dilution factor. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that the initial population has a certain number of plasmids, N. When the cells are selected for lysogenic phages, only half survive. These N/2 cells are then placed on strain B, and their plasmid copy numbers are adjusted by the dilution factor. Similarly, the other half are placed on strain K.\n\nHowever, the exact relationship isn't clear. Maybe the key is to recognize that the number of plasmids after dilution should be consistent with the efficiency of the mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the number of recombinants (R):\n\nR = (p + q - pq) * S\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the alleles, S is the selection coefficient, and R is the number of recombinants.\n\nBut this is getting too complex without knowing the specific parameters.\n\nAlternatively, given the difficulty in calculating, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nGiven that the answer options are small percentages (like 1%, 2%, etc.), it suggests that the mutation is rare, and the number of plasmids is low. Given that, the efficiency of the mutation can be estimated.\n\nAssuming that the number of plasmids after dilution indicates the efficiency. Let's take the first scenario: when only lysogenic phages are present, half the cells die. This implies that the lysogenic phage integrated into the E. coli and started replicating inside, leading to death after replication. However, when mixed with lytic phages, some cells die due to insufficient replication capacity.\n\nIn the second experiment, the number of plasmids on strain B is 40, and on K is 4. Let's assume that the number of plasmids is proportional to the efficiency of the mutation. If the mutation is efficient, the number of plasmids should be high. Conversely, if the mutation is inefficient, the number of plasmids should be lower.\n\nLooking at the results, strain B has significantly more plasmids (40 vs 4), suggesting a more efficient mutation. However, this contradicts the idea that more plasmids imply a less efficient mutation because higher plasmid copy numbers typically indicate stronger replication.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing replication inside the E. coli, so the replication should occur faster. Thus, if the mutation is efficient, the number of plasmids should increase as more cells express the mutation.\n\nBut in our results, strain B has 40 plasmids, which is much higher than strain K's 4. So, the lysogenic phage is more efficiently expressed in strain B than in strain K.\n\nWait, but the problem states that strain B is infected by two types of mutantphages simultaneously. One causes lysogenic fission and the other causes lytic fission. Only the lysogenic phage kills the E. coli in strain B. The survivors are split into two groups, each with different selection pressures.\n\nHmm, perhaps the efficiency of the mutation is linked to the number of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage causes full replication inside the E. coli, then each replication event increases the plasmid count by one. So, if the mutation is highly efficient, the number of plasmids should be high.\n\nBut in the results, strain B has 40 plasmids, which is quite high. If the mutation is efficient, this makes sense. Strain K, having no lysogenic phages, retains fewer plasmids.\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination percentage?\n\nWait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different regions of the genome. In this context, the two mutations are in the T4 RNA pol II vector.\n\nRecombination between two mutations would involve the transfer of the T4 RNA pol II gene between the two regions. The likelihood of this happening depends on the efficiency of the selection process.\n\nThe efficiency of recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEfficiency = (f1 * f2) / (1 - f1 - f2 + f1*f2)\n\nWhere f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two mutations in the population.\n\nHowever, without knowing f1 and f2, it's challenging to compute directly. Instead, we can infer based on the plasmid numbers.\n\nEach mutation likely confers a certain level of replication stress. The efficiency of recombination is",

This means there are very few phages, so most colonies survive. However, four pluses are found on strain B's lawn. Then, the second half is dilute 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Here, more phages are present, leading to more pluses, specifically four on strain K.\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations interact or not. If they're independent, we'd expect some expected plasmid counts. But here, since only four pluses are found on strain K, which isn't as high as the four on B, it suggests that the interaction might be occurring. \n\nIn recombinant systems, if you have two mutants, the number of plasmids detected depends on their relationship. If they're non-recombinant (like dominant), you'd see fewer plasmids than expected. Recombination would increase detection rates because the phages might affect the replication rate differently. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, I think the formula involves the ratio of plasmids detected on each lawn. Since the first half (diluted 1:10^7) has four pluses and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) has four plus on K, maybe the higher dilution affects the detection. \n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for recombinant frequency using the counts from the two plating wells. The formula is:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (Count1 * Count2) / (Total Plasmids)\n\nBut I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Alternatively, considering that the presence of four pluses on K suggests some interaction, while on B it's lower. Maybe the recombination coefficient (r) relates to how much the plasmids interfere. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that the expected number under no interference (non-recombination) would be proportional to the product of the plasmid frequencies from each well. So, if the count on K is four times what's expected without interference, that could indicate some degree of recombination.\n\nWait, let me think again. Without any recombination, the probability that a phage from each half contributes a plasmid to the same offspring would be (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction. If r=0, all plasmids would contribute independently. But if r=1, all would interfere.\n\nGiven that the first sample (diluted 1:10^7) shows four pluses, and the second (diluted 1:10^5) shows four on K, perhaps the number indicates a certain level of interference. \n\nLet me try calculating. Suppose the expected number without recombination is N1*N2/(N1 + N2). Wait, that's the expectation under Hardy-Weinberg. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, the observed plasmids might indicate the degree of interference. For example, if the observed count is less than expected due to interference, then some phages are interfering with each other.\n\nWait, another way: the number of plasmids detected on strain B's lawn is four, and on strain K's lawn, it's also four, but on a lower dilution. So maybe the presence on K implies that some recombination occurred. \n\nPerhaps the key is that when two mutations are present, the chance that a phage carries both mutations is affected by their relationship. If they are independent (no recombination), the frequency would be lower. If they are recombinant, the frequency would be higher.\n\nLooking at the counts, on K, the number of plasmids is similar to the first well, except it's a higher dilution. Maybe the recombination leads to a higher proportion of plasmids being detected on K, suggesting some interaction.\n\nWait, I think the formula for recombination frequency using plating data is:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (C1 + C2)\n\nWhere C1 and C2 are the counts from the two plating wells. But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (C1 + C2 - Total Plasmids) / Total Plasmids\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the formula for recombinant frequency based on plating results.\n\nUpon recalling, the correct formula for recombinant frequency R is given by:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (N1 + N2)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are the counts of the two plating wells, and N1 and N2 are the total plasmids in each well.\n\nSo applying this, let's say C1 = 4 and C2 = 4, assuming N1 and N2 are large enough that C1 and C2 represent the plasmid frequencies. Then R = (4*4)/(4+4) = 16/8 = 2. That seems too high, as recombination shouldn't exceed 100%. Perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Another source says that the recombination frequency R is given by:\n\nR = (C1 + C2 - D) / (N1 + N2)\n\nWhere D is the double reciprocal plating count, but I don't know D here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (N1 * N2)\n\nAssuming N1 and N2 are large. In our case, C1 = 4, C2 = 4, so R = 16 / (N1*N2). But without knowing N1 and N2, I can't compute it numerically.\n\nMaybe another approach: since the first sample has four pluses, and the second has four on K, perhaps the recombination is such that some phages interfere. If the recombination were complete (100%), then the counts would be lower because phages carrying both mutations wouldn't replicate as efficiently. \n\nIf the counts on K are the same as on B, that might suggest that recombination didn't occur. But in this case, the counts are slightly lower on K? Or higher?\n\nWait, actually, the first half (diluted 1:10^7) has four pluses on B and none on K, while the second half (diluted 1:10^5) has four on K and none on B. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. It's possible I misinterpreted the results.\n\nWait, perhaps the counts are four pluses on B in the first half and four on K in the second half, meaning that the presence on K indicates some recombination. So the recombination is happening because the two mutations are interacting, causing some phages to interfere, thus reducing the detectable plasmids.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would depend on the number of plasmids detected on each side. If the counts are similar, maybe it's moderate recombination.\n\nBut without precise numbers, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, looking at the options, the highest percentage is 5%, and others go down. Given that the counts are relatively low (four pluses), the recombination must be significant but not extreme.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the likelihood of recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the recombination frequency would be high. If they are independent, it would be low.\n\nSince the counts are similar but not identical, it suggests some interaction but not complete recombination. Looking at the options, G is 0.5% and H is 5%. Between these, perhaps the correct answer is around 1%.\n\nWait, another angle: the expected number of plasmids without recombination would be additive, whereas with recombination, some plasmids would cancel each other out. So if the observed plasmids are lower, it suggests recombination.\n\nBut I'm still not confident. Maybe I should consider that the presence of four pluses on K compared to zero on B suggests that some recombination has happened. So the recombination frequency is somewhere above 0%.\n\nLooking back at the options, I see F is 0.3%, which is close to my intuition. Alternatively, D is 0.1%, which is even smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation requires knowing the exact formula. Let me try again. The standard method uses:\n\nR = (C1 + C2 - D) / (N1 + N2)\n\nBut without D, this is tricky. Alternatively, the formula often used is:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (N1 * N2)\n\nAssuming N1 and N2 are large, then R \u2248 (C1 * C2) / (N1 * N2).\n\nBut since I don't have N1 and N2, I can't compute it numerically. Maybe the problem expects an approximate value.\n\nGiven that the first sample (diluted 1:10^7) has four pluses, and the second (diluted 1:10^5) has four on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 0.1% to 0.3%.\n\nLooking at the options, F is 0.3% and G is 0.5%. So between those, G is 0.5% which is higher.\n\nWait, another thought: the number of plasmids detected on each lawn might relate inversely to the dilution factor. Dilution 1:10^7 means 1e7 plasmids per mL, whereas 1:10^5 is 1e5 plasmids per mL. So the first sample has higher concentration, leading to higher plasmid density, making it easier to detect. The second sample has lower concentration, so plasmid density is lower, making detection harder.\n\nBut in the experiment, four pluses were found on both samples, just on different lichens. Maybe the difference lies in the interaction between the mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency can be estimated as follows: the expected number of plasmids without recombination would be (C1 + C2)/something, but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect us to recognize that the presence of four pluses on K suggests that some recombination occurred, indicating a moderate level of interaction. Among the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but another perspective: if there was no recombination, the number of plasmids would be additive. With some recombination, some plasmids cancel out. So the observed plasmids could be lower than expected. But without precise calculations, it's hard to tell.\n\nHmm, I'm going to make a guess. Based on the reasoning that some recombination occurred, the recombination frequency is likely around 0.3% to 0.5%, so option F or G. Since the counts are slightly different, maybe closer to 0.3%.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So if it's moderate, perhaps 0.3% is the closest option.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose F.0.3 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

If they are recombinant, the frequency would be higher.\n\nLooking at the counts, on K, the number of plasmids is similar to the first well, except it's a higher dilution. Maybe the recombination leads to a higher proportion of plasmids being detected on K, suggesting some interaction.\n\nWait, I think the formula for recombination frequency using plating data is:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (C1 + C2)\n\nWhere C1 and C2 are the counts from the two plating wells. But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (C1 + C2 - Total Plasmids) / Total Plasmids\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the formula for recombinant frequency based on plating results.\n\nUpon recalling, the correct formula for recombinant frequency R is given by:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (N1 + N2)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are the counts of the two plating wells, and N1 and N2 are the total plasmids in each well.\n\nSo applying this, let's say C1 = 4 and C2 = 4, assuming N1 and N2 are large enough that C1 and C2 represent the plasmid frequencies. Then R = (4*4)/(4+4) = 16/8 = 2. That seems too high, as recombination shouldn't exceed 100%. Perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Another source says that the recombination frequency R is given by:\n\nR = (C1 + C2 - D) / (N1 + N2)\n\nWhere D is the double reciprocal plating count, but I don't know D here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (N1 * N2)\n\nAssuming N1 and N2 are large. In our case, C1 = 4, C2 = 4, so R = 16 / (N1*N2). But without knowing N1 and N2, I can't compute it numerically.\n\nMaybe another approach: since the first sample has four pluses, and the second has four on K, perhaps the recombination is such that some phages interfere. If the recombination were complete (100%), then the counts would be lower because phages carrying both mutations wouldn't replicate as efficiently. \n\nIf the counts on K are the same as on B, that might suggest that recombination didn't occur. But in this case, the counts are slightly lower on K? Or higher?\n\nWait, actually, the first half (diluted 1:10^7) has four pluses on B and none on K, while the second half (diluted 1:10^5) has four on K and none on B. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. It's possible I misinterpreted the results.\n\nWait, perhaps the counts are four pluses on B in the first half and four on K in the second half, meaning that the presence on K indicates some recombination. So the recombination is happening because the two mutations are interacting, causing some phages to interfere, thus reducing the detectable plasmids.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would depend on the number of plasmids detected on each side. If the counts are similar, maybe it's moderate recombination.\n\nBut without precise numbers, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, looking at the options, the highest percentage is 5%, and others go down. Given that the counts are relatively low (four pluses), the recombination must be significant but not extreme.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the likelihood of recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the recombination frequency would be high. If they are independent, it would be low.\n\nSince the counts are similar but not identical, it suggests some interaction but not complete recombination. Looking at the options, G is 0.5% and H is 5%. Between these, perhaps the correct answer is around 1%.\n\nWait, another angle: the expected number of plasmids without recombination would be additive, whereas with recombination, some plasmids would cancel each other out. So if the observed plasmids are lower, it suggests recombination.\n\nBut I'm still not confident. Maybe I should consider that the presence of four pluses on K compared to zero on B suggests that some recombination has happened. So the recombination frequency is somewhere above 0%.\n\nLooking back at the options, I see F is 0.3%, which is close to my intuition. Alternatively, D is 0.1%, which is even smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation requires knowing the exact formula. Let me try again. The standard method uses:\n\nR = (C1 + C2 - D) / (N1 + N2)\n\nBut without D, this is tricky. Alternatively, the formula often used is:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / (N1 * N2)\n\nAssuming N1 and N2 are large, then R \u2248 (C1 * C2) / (N1 * N2).\n\nBut since I don't have N1 and N2, I can't compute it numerically. Maybe the problem expects an approximate value.\n\nGiven that the first sample (diluted 1:10^7) has four pluses, and the second (diluted 1:10^5) has four on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 0.1% to 0.3%.\n\nLooking at the options, F is 0.3% and G is 0.5%. So between those, G is 0.5% which is higher.\n\nWait, another thought: the number of plasmids detected on each lawn might relate inversely to the dilution factor. Dilution 1:10^7 means 1e7 plasmids per mL, whereas 1:10^5 is 1e5 plasmids per mL. So the first sample has higher concentration, leading to higher plasmid density, making it easier to detect. The second sample has lower concentration, so plasmid density is lower, making detection harder.\n\nBut in the experiment, four pluses were found on both samples, just on different lichens. Maybe the difference lies in the interaction between the mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency can be estimated as follows: the expected number of plasmids without recombination would be (C1 + C2)/something, but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect us to recognize that the presence of four pluses on K suggests that some recombination occurred, indicating a moderate level of interaction. Among the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but another perspective: if there was no recombination, the number of plasmids would be additive. With some recombination, some plasmids cancel out. So the observed plasmids could be lower than expected. But without precise calculations, it's hard to tell.\n\nHmm, I'm going to make a guess. Based on the reasoning that some recombination occurred, the recombination frequency is likely around 0.3% to 0.5%, so option F or G. Since the counts are slightly different, maybe closer to 0.3%.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So if it's moderate, perhaps 0.3% is the closest option.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose F.0.3 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

These are then plated onto lawn cultures of E. coli strain B and another of strain K respectively. The number of pluses (bubbles) found are 4 on K and 40 on B.\n\nHmm, I think this relates to double resistance or recombinant phages. If there's recombination, the phages would have different resistances. In this case, the lysogenic phage from the mutant might cause lysogeny resistance when it's combined with the lysogenic phage from strain B. Wait, no\u2014strain B has only the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage would lyse it, causing the colony to die. So if there's recombination, maybe the phages aren't as effective against each other.\n\nWait, actually, let's think about what happens during the experiment. When the phages are mixed, if they are recombinant, some phages might not lyse the target bacteria as well because they're combining different mutations. So in the first group, which is more diluted (1:10^7), perhaps less resistant phages will lyse the bacteria. Then when it's plated on strain K, if there's recombination, the lysogenic phage from strain B could be more effective, leading to fewer pluses. But wait, the result was 4 on K, which is higher than expected if all were effective. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this backwards.\n\nAlternatively, recombination might mean that the lysogenic phages are more effective when mixed together, leading to more resistance. So when both types are present, the phages might lyse the bacteria better because they're combining their mutations. That way, fewer pluses occur on strain K, which makes sense since the lysogenic phage should kill the E. coli more effectively.\n\nBut how do we quantify the recombination? I remember that the Hill coefficient is used for double resistance, but here it's about recombination. Maybe using the formula for recombination frequency: Recombination Frequency = (1 - (number of resistant colonies / total)) * 100. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for double resistance: Recombination Frequency (RF) = 1 - (dilution factor)^n, where n depends on the order. Or maybe it's simpler: RF = (1/(dilution factor))^n - 1. For example, if dilution is 1/10^7, then 1/1e7 is 0.0000001. If there's complete recombination, maybe the probability is 1e-7, but that seems too low. Alternatively, I've heard that the number of plasmids indicates recombination. Each recombination event doubles the number of plasmid copies, so the number of plasmids might indicate the number of recombined genes. So if you count the number of plasmids, say m, then the recombination frequency is 1/m.\n\nIn the first group, which is more dilute (1:1e7), the number of plasmids would be lower, meaning less recombination. Let's see: On strain B, 4 pluses found, each plus corresponds to multiple plasmids. Assuming each plus requires several plasmids, like 16, then 4 pluses would require 64 plasmids. Similarly, on strain K, 40 pluses would correspond to around 1600 plasmids. If the dilution factor is 1:1e7, the number of plasmids per well would be 1e7. So the ratio of plasmids between the two groups would be 64 : 1600, simplifying to 1:25. So the recombination frequency is approximately 1/25, which is 4%. But that's not matching any of the options. Maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of recombination leads to increased resistance. If the recombination fraction is r, then the number of resistant colonies would decrease by (1 - r). But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky. Another approach: using the formula for double resistance: RF = (1 - (number of resistant colonies / total)) * 100. Here, the resistant colonies are those that died after lysis. Since strain B is lysogenic, the lysogenic phage would lyse it, making it die. Strain K is also lysogenic, but if there's recombination, the phage might not lyse it as effectively. So the number of pluses (dead colonies) would depend on the phage-resistance.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating recombination frequency from such experiments. From what I recall, the number of times the two mutations interact (recombine) affects the likelihood of the phage being effective. The formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as rf = (1 - (m/n)), where m is the number of resistant colonies and n is the total. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nGiven the options, the closest to 4% isn't available, so perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should consider that the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of recombination events. If strain B shows 4 pluses, and strain K shows 40, the ratio is 1:10. So if each recombination adds one plasmid, then the recombination frequency is 1 in 10, which is 10%, but again, that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the reciprocal: 1/10 means 10%, but the answer options don't include 10%.\n\nWait, looking back, the possible answers are from 0.01% to 5%. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the number of plasmids indicates the degree of recombination. If strain B has 4 plasmids and strain K has 40, the difference is 36. So 36 plasmids represent the recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency is 36 per 1e7 dilution. To find the percentage, 36/1e7 = 0.000036, which is 0.0036%, approximately 0.004%. That's close to option F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). But neither matches exactly. Alternatively, if I take the log base 2 of the number of plasmids, since each recombination doubles the number of plasmids. Log2(36)=~5.16, which suggests about 5 recombination events, translating to ~5%, which is option C. But earlier calculation suggested 0.004%, which doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to calculate the number of plasmids as the number of resistant colonies multiplied by the dilution factor. For strain B, 4 pluses at 1e7 dilution give 4*1e7=4e7 plasmids. For strain K, 40 pluses at 1e5 dilution give 40*1e5=4e6 plasmids. The ratio is 4e7 : 4e6 = 10:1. So the number of plasmids is 10 times higher in B compared to K, implying that the recombination occurs once every 10 plasmids. But that's speculative.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plasmids might relate to the number of recombination events. Each recombination increases the number of plasmids by one. So if strain B has 4 plasmids and strain K has 40, the difference is 36. So 36 recombination events occurred. The number of plasmids is proportional to the logarithmic scale of the recombination frequency. Using the formula rf = ln(1 + (plasmids)/(total)) / total, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids is the number of times the phage successfully integrated into the phage vector. Each recombination integrates into the vector, increasing the number of plasmids. So if strain B has 4 plasmids and strain K has 40, the recombination rate is 36 per 10 million cells. Converting that to a percentage, 36 / (10^7) = 0.0000036, which is 0.00036%, roughly 0.0004%, which is much lower than any given option. This doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the correct answer is B, 2 percent, because sometimes the Hill coefficient for double resistance is around 0.02 or 2%, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plasmids indicates the degree of recombination. The number of plasmids (m) is related to the recombination frequency (rf) by the formula rf \u2248 ln(m)/ln(2). So if strain B has 4 plasmids, then rf_B = ln(4)/ln(2) \u2248 2. Stringent frequency. For strain K, 40 plasmids gives rf_K = ln(40)/ln(2) \u2248 5.32. Now, the difference in rf between the two would be 5.32 - 2 = 3.32, which is roughly 3.32 times the rf of strain B. So the actual recombination between the two mutants is about 3.32 times greater than strain B's rf. But I'm not sure how to apply this to find the overall recombination between the two specific mutations.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. I think I'll go with the initial estimate of 0.004%, which is closer to 0.01%, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F, 0.3%, assuming that the difference in plasmids reflects the recombination. But I'm not confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The other half is treated with a 1:10^5 dilution and plated on strain K, resulting in four plus on K and 40 pluses on B.\n\nHmm, wait. If there's no recombination, then all mutants would behave similarly. But here, we see different behaviors on each half. So maybe recombination affects how these mutants interact within the same host or across different hosts.\n\nThe experiment involves mixing the two mutantphages and seeing if they cause different outcomes. The first half (with higher dilution) shows fewer pluses, meaning less lethality. The second half has more pluses on strain K. That suggests that the lysogenic mutation is more effective at killing the E. coli, while the lytic mutation might be causing some issues, but since it doesn't lyse, perhaps it's not as harmful?\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it should just integrate better. The lytic phage, which lyses, would kill the bacteria immediately. But if it's mixed, maybe the lysogenic one isn't efficient enough to kill, leading to some plasmid retention or expression of the lytic mutation.\n\nNow, considering the population effect, the initial division into two equal parts might mean that each part represents a cross between the two mutants. So when you plate them on strain B, the first half (higher dilution) might have a lower chance of showing lethality because the mixture isn't pure. Similarly, the second half (lower dilution) would show more lethality because the mixture includes both types.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the second half (lower dilution) should have similar behavior as the first half. But instead, it has more pluses on K and fewer on B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more potent, leading to lethality. This implies that the lysogenic mutation is more effective than the lytic one, which makes sense because lysogenic phages don't lyse.\n\nBut how does recombination fit into this? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages. In this case, the lysogenic and lytic phages might have exchanged segments, affecting their activity. However, in the absence of recombination, the lysogenic should act independently of the lytic. \n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both types leads to differential effects. If the lysogenic were more active, it should kill more on strain B, but it did not. Instead, on strain K, it killed more (four pluses), and on strain B, it didn't kill much (40 pluses). Wait, actually, on B, it only had four pluses, which seems low. On K, it had four pluses as well, which is the same number as on B.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. The first half (higher dilution) of strain B showed four pluses. The second half (lower dilution) of strain K showed four pluses. The first half of strain K, when plated on B, had 40 pluses, and the second half of strain K, when plated on K, had four pluses.\n\nThis suggests that when the lysogenic and lytic phages are mixed, the lysogenic takes over in the presence of the lytic. Or vice versa. Since the lysogenic doesn't lyse, it integrates better, leading to higher fitness in the environment where it's present. However, when both are present, the lysogenic might dominate, leading to more plasmids and thus more lethality.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination could affect the distribution of alleles or interactions between different phages. Maybe the presence of recombination allows for some exchange of genetic information, making the lysogenic phage more effective in certain conditions.\n\nWait, another angle: If there was complete recombination, the lysogenic and lytic phages might have swapped segments, potentially enhancing the lysogenic's ability to replicate without causing death. But in this experiment, the lysogenic wasn't more effective. Alternatively, recombination might allow the lysogenic to be expressed differently, such as integrating better or expressing certain genes that make it more lethal.\n\nLooking back at the numbers: The second half of strain K had four pluses, which is similar to the first half of strain B, which also had four pluses. The first half of strain B had 40 pluses, which is significantly higher. Wait, that doesn't seem right. If the lysogenic is more effective, then when both are present, the lysogenic should die more often, meaning fewer pluses on strain B. But in reality, it died less (40 pluses vs. four on B).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is more efficient at replication rather than lethality. But the experiment measures lethality\u2014plasmids sticking around. So if the lysogenic is more efficient at replication, it would lead to more plasmid loss, hence more lethality.\n\nWait, but when both are present, the lysogenic might take over the replication machinery, making the lysogenic more effective. So in the first half of strain B, which lacks the lysogenic phage, the replication of the lysogenic phage wouldn't occur, so less lethality. In the second half of strain K, which has the lysogenic phage, it integrates better and replicates more efficiently, leading to more plasmids and thus more lethality.\n\nSo the key point is that the lysogenic phage is more effective in the presence of the lytic phage. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a genetic advantage when integrated with the lytic phage.\n\nHow does recombination come into play here? Recombination allows for genetic exchange between different phages. If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage might acquire some segments from the lytic phage, allowing it to replicate more efficiently. This would enhance its ability to replicate without dying, leading to increased lethality when both are present.\n\nTherefore, the presence of recombination indicates that the lysogenic phage gains some genetic elements from the lytic phage, increasing its replication efficiency. Without recombination, the lysogenic would replicate independently, and its effectiveness would depend solely on its own properties.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic was more effective when both phages were present, this points towards recombination as the mechanism driving this difference.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal halves. One half is treated with a 1:10^7 dilution and plated on strain B, resulting in four pluses. The other half is treated with a 1:10^5 dilution and plated on strain K, resulting in four plus on K and 40 pluses on B.\n\nHmm, wait. If there's no recombination, then all mutants would behave similarly. But here, we see different behaviors on each half. So maybe recombination affects how these mutants interact within the same host or across different hosts.\n\nThe experiment involves mixing the two mutantphages and seeing if they cause different outcomes. The first half (with higher dilution) shows fewer pluses, meaning less lethality. The second half has more pluses on strain K. That suggests that the lysogenic mutation is more effective at killing the E. coli, while the lytic mutation might be causing some issues, but since it doesn't lyse, perhaps it's not as harmful?\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it should just integrate better. The lytic phage, which lyses, would kill the bacteria immediately. But if it's mixed, maybe the lysogenic one isn't efficient enough to kill, leading to some plasmid retention or expression of the lytic mutation.\n\nNow, considering the population effect, the initial division into two equal parts might mean that each part represents a cross between the two mutants. So when you plate them on strain B, the first half (higher dilution) might have a lower chance of showing lethality because the mixture isn't pure. Similarly, the second half (lower dilution) would show more lethality because the mixture includes both types.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the second half (lower dilution) should have similar behavior as the first half. But instead, it has more pluses on K and fewer on B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more potent, leading to lethality. This implies that the lysogenic mutation is more effective than the lytic one, which makes sense because lysogenic phages don't lyse.\n\nBut how does recombination fit into this? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages. In this case, the lysogenic and lytic phages might have exchanged segments, affecting their activity. However, in the absence of recombination, the lysogenic should act independently of the lytic. \n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both types leads to differential effects. If the lysogenic were more active, it should kill more on strain B, but it did not. Instead, on strain K, it killed more (four pluses), and on strain B, it didn't kill much (40 pluses). Wait, actually, on B, it only had four pluses, which seems low. On K, it had four pluses as well, which is the same number as on B.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. The first half (higher dilution) of strain B showed four pluses. The second half (lower dilution) of strain K showed four pluses. The first half of strain K, when plated on B, had 40 pluses, and the second half of strain K, when plated on K, had four pluses.\n\nThis suggests that when the lysogenic and lytic phages are mixed, the lysogenic takes over in the presence of the lytic. Or vice versa. Since the lysogenic doesn't lyse, it integrates better, leading to higher fitness in the environment where it's present. However, when both are present, the lysogenic might dominate, leading to more plasmids and thus more lethality.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination could affect the distribution of alleles or interactions between different phages. Maybe the presence of recombination allows for some exchange of genetic information, making the lysogenic phage more effective in certain conditions.\n\nWait, another angle: If there was complete recombination, the lysogenic and lytic phages might have swapped segments, potentially enhancing the lysogenic's ability to replicate without causing death.

In the second half of strain K, which has the lysogenic phage, it integrates better and replicates more efficiently, leading to more plasmids and thus more lethality.\n\nSo the key point is that the lysogenic phage is more effective in the presence of the lytic phage.

One half is plated on strain B's lawn, and the other on strain K's. Each half is then dilated to different concentrations before being plated. The numbers given are 40 plumes on B's lawn and 4 on K's? Or is it that the total number of plumes in each half is 40 on B and 4 on K, making 44 plumes in total across both experiments?\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: The initial infection is done by both types of phage. The cells are divided into two equal parts. One part (double mutation) is plated on strain B's lawn, which results in some number of plumes. The other part (single mutation?) or perhaps another condition is plated on strain K's lawn. Alternatively, each half is treated independently: one half is plated on B's strain, and the other half is plated on K's strain, each at their respective dilutions.\n\nBut the key point here is about the recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of two different mutations within the same gene locus, especially during transduction. In this case, the T_4 phage carries two mutations\u2014mutant A (lytic) and mutant B (lytic as well, since lysogenic means it doesn't lyse). Wait, actually, in the problem statement, the phages cause lytic fission if they have mutation rII, right? Because the lytic phage would replicate and lyse the cell.\n\nWait, no, the phage types are:\n\n- Type A: Lysogenic, so they integrate into the host genome, do not lyse the cell.\n- Type B: Lytic, so they replicate and lyse the cell.\n\nIn the problem, both phages cause problems. The lysogenic phage (Type B) would lyse the E. coli, causing death, while the lytic phage (Type A) would lyse the E. coli, but in reality, lysogenic phages don't lyse; instead, they allow replication. Wait, I might be getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nPhages have two main mechanisms:\n\n1. **Lytic phages**: They lysize the host cell, release new phage particles, and then integrate them into the host genome. This allows them to replicate and cause further damage.\n\n2. **Lysozyme phages**: They replicate inside the host cell and lyse it, releasing new phage particles.\n\nIn the context of T_4 phage, which is a lysogenic phage, its integration into the bacterial chromosome is essential for it to replicate and cause lysogeny. If a phage has mutation rII, it integrates and becomes a lysogen, which cannot lyse the cell. However, if there's a mutation elsewhere, such as in the rI region, the phage can integrate and become lytic (Type B), allowing it to lyse the cell.\n\nNow, back to the experiment:\n\nTwo types of mutantphages are present:\n\n- **Mutant A**: Lysogenic (integrated), which causes the E. coli to lyse (so it's a bad phage).\n- **Mutant B**: LYtic (not integrated?), but wait, in this context, perhaps Mutant B is a lytic phage that cannot integrate because it lacks mutation rII. So when placed on E. coli strain B, which already has mutation rII (a lysogen), the lytic phage (Mutant B) would lyse the cell, killing the E. coli. But when placed on strain K, which presumably doesn't have mutation rII, it would integrate and become a lysogen (lytic), causing the cell to lyse.\n\nHowever, the problem states that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage (Mutant B) affects strain B. That suggests that when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (Mutant B) kills the E. coli, but the lytic phage (Mutant A) wouldn't affect strain B because it requires mutation rII to integrate, which isn't present here.\n\nWait, but the way the experiment is set up is that both types are present in the same solution. So if both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage (Mutant B) would lyse the E. coli, regardless of whether it's lysogenic or not. But in reality, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; it integrates and allows replication. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are considered to be either lysogenic or non-integrating. Maybe Mutant A is a non-integrating phage (Type A) which integrates upon infection, becoming a lysogen and lyzing the cell. Mutant B is a lysogenic phage that doesn't lyze but integrates and allows replication. So when mixed together, only the non-integrating phage (Mutant A) causes the lysogeny effect because the integrating phage (Mutant B) can't lyse.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the lysogenic phage would lyse the cell, but in reality, lysogenic phages don't lyse; they just replicate. So perhaps the confusion arises from terminology.\n\nLet me approach this methodically. The goal is to find the recombination frequency (RF) between the two mutations in the T_4 phage. RF is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{1}{(m+1)(n+1)} } \\]\n\nwhere m is the proportion of one mutation type and n the proportion of the other. Alternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{(m+n)^2}{(m+1)(n+1)} - 1 \\]\n\nBut I think the basic formula is:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{1}{(m+1)(n+1)} } \\]\n\nWhere m is the frequency of one mutation, n the other. Alternatively, depending on how the data is presented.\n\nGiven the experimental results, we can calculate the probabilities of each mutation occurring and then determine their combination.\n\nEach plate is treated with a certain concentration of phages. For example, in the first scenario, a concentration of 1:10^7 is used, and another of 1:10^5.\n\nWhen the E. coli is plated on strain B's lawn, the number of plumes indicates the number of successfully lysed cells. Similarly for strain K.\n\nFrom the problem, when both mutants are present (i.e., the concentration is 1:10^7), the E. coli is halved into two halves: one half is plated on strain B's lawn (resulting in 40 plumes) and the other half is plated on strain K's lawn (resulting in 4 plumes).\n\nSimilarly, when only the mutation is present (concentration 1:10^5), the E. coli is plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 4 plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the data provided.\n\nAt 1:10^7 concentration:\n\n- Strain B lawn: 40 plumes\n- Strain K lawn: 4 plumes\n\nAt 1:10^5 concentration:\n\n- Strain B lawn: 4 plumes\n- Strain K lawn: ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps at 1:10^5 concentration, the E. coli is halved again, but the problem describes it as \"plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B\" and \"plated on strain K\". So perhaps at 1:10^7, both mutants are present, and the results are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. At 1:10^5, only one mutation is present, and the results are 4 plumes on B.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact interpretation, so perhaps I should proceed with what I know.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections where the phage lysed the E. coli. So higher numbers mean more successful lysis.\n\nThe expected number of plumes depends on the concentrations and the frequencies of the mutations. Since the phages are randomly distributed, the probability of a phage infecting a cell is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the phage and the target cell's susceptibility.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently, the probability of a phage carrying either mutation is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product (for recombination).\n\nLet me denote:\n\np_A = probability of mutation A (non-integrating, thus lysogenic)\np_B = probability of mutation B (integrating, thus lysogen)\n\nWe need to find the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of cases where both mutations occur.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both mutants are present, only the lysogenic phage (which is mutation B) causes an issue. That suggests that when both are present, only mutation B leads to the issue, implying that mutation A doesn't cause any problem in the presence of mutation B.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lytic phage (mutation B) causes the E. coli to lyse. But in reality, lysogenic phages don't lyse; they just replicate. So perhaps the problem is using \"lysis\" incorrectly, confusing lysogenic and non-integrating phages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are considered to behave as follows:\n\n- Mutation A: Integrates and becomes a lysogen (lytic, which lyse the cell)\n- Mutation B: Does not integrate and remains lytic (but doesn't lyse the cell, just replicates)\n\nIf that's the case, then when both mutants are present, only mutation B (non-integrating) causes the issue, whereas mutation A (integrating) does nothing. Hence, in the experiment, when both are present, only mutation B affects the E. coli, resulting in the observed outcome.\n\nTherefore, the presence of mutation A (integrating) doesn't cause any issue when both mutants are present, suggesting that it doesn't contribute to the recombination.\n\nBut the problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of two different mutations in the same gene locus, particularly in transduction events.\n\nIf recombination occurred, it would mean that both mutations are present in a single phage, leading to the expression of the recombinant protein. However, in our experiment, when both mutants are present, neither mutation alone affects the outcome. Instead, the interaction may lead to lethality.\n\nLooking at the experimental data, when both mutants are present (1:10^7), the E. coli is halved into two halves: one half is plated on strain B's lawn (40 plumes), and the other on strain K's (4 plumes). Similarly, when only one mutation is present (1:10^5), the E. coli is plated on strain B's lawn with 4 plumes.\n\nThis suggests that when only one mutation is present, the number of plumes corresponds to the occurrence of that mutation. For example, in the 1:10^5 treatment, only 4 cells were lysed, indicating the presence of mutation B.\n\nBut when both mutations are present, the number of plumes increases significantly. On strain B, it's 40, which is much higher than the 4 on strain K. This suggests that the combined presence of both mutations causes a severe effect, possibly due to recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nEach mutation contributes to the overall probability of the combination. The expected number of plumes when both mutations are present would depend on the product of their probabilities.\n\nAssuming independence, the expected number of plumes (E) when both mutations are present is:\n\nE = (1/10^7 + p_A + p_B + p_A*p_B) * N\n\nWhere N is the total number of cells.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps a better approach is to assume that the number of plumes reflects the number of successful infections. If both mutations are present, the probability of a phage infecting a cell is the product of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nq_A = probability of mutation A\nq_B = probability of mutation B\n\nSince each phage is independent, the probability of a phage carrying either mutation is q_A + q_B - q_A*q_B (to account for recombination). However, in our experiment, the number of plumes increased significantly when both mutations are present, indicating that the combination caused a lethal effect.\n\nThe expected number of plumes when both mutations are present is likely higher than when only one mutation is present. From the data:\n\nWhen only mutation B is present (1:10^5), 4 plumes are observed on strain B.\n\nWhen both mutations are present (1:10^7), 40 plumes are observed on strain B.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful infections, increasing the number of plumes.\n\nThe ratio of plumes in the presence of both mutations compared to only one mutation gives an idea of the interaction.\n\nRatio = 40 / 4 = 10.\n\nThis implies that the interaction (recombination) caused a tenfold increase in the number of plumes when both mutations are present.\n\nRecombination frequency can be approximated by considering the change in plume count. However, this might not directly translate to RF.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of plumes as a function of the probabilities of each mutation. Let\u2019s suppose that without any mutation, all phages are non-integrating, so the probability of infection is q_non-integrating = 1 / (10^7 + 1), assuming uniform distribution.\n\nBut this line of thinking is getting too convoluted without clear mathematical relationships.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the number of plumes when both mutations are present is 10 times higher than when only one mutation is present. This suggests that the combination of both mutations is lethal and that their interaction leads to a significant increase in the number of successful infections.\n\nIn terms of recombination frequency, the presence of both mutations in the same phage leads to lethality. The calculation for RF typically involves determining the fraction of cells that express the recombinant protein. However, in this case, the lethality is linked to the interaction of both mutations, rather than the expression of a recombinant protein.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would correspond to the likelihood that both mutations occurred in the same phage molecule, leading to lethality.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the increase in plumes when both mutations are present suggests that the interaction is significant. To estimate RF, we can look at the ratio of plumes in the presence of both mutations compared to the absence of either.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for RF when two mutations are involved:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{1}{(m+1)(n+1)} } \\]\n\nWhere m and n are the fractions of cells expressing each mutation.\n\nBut without knowing the actual frequencies, it's challenging to compute.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is around 1%, corresponding to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

However, if there's a mutation elsewhere, such as in the rI region, the phage can integrate and become lytic (Type B), allowing it to lyse the cell.\n\nNow, back to the experiment:\n\nTwo types of mutantphages are present:\n\n- **Mutant A**: Lysogenic (integrated), which causes the E. coli to lyse (so it's a bad phage).\n- **Mutant B**: LYtic (not integrated?), but wait, in this context, perhaps Mutant B is a lytic phage that cannot integrate because it lacks mutation rII. So when placed on E. coli strain B, which already has mutation rII (a lysogen), the lytic phage (Mutant B) would lyse the cell, killing the E. coli. But when placed on strain K, which presumably doesn't have mutation rII, it would integrate and become a lysogen (lytic), causing the cell to lyse.\n\nHowever, the problem states that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage (Mutant B) affects strain B. That suggests that when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (Mutant B) kills the E. coli, but the lytic phage (Mutant A) wouldn't affect strain B because it requires mutation rII to integrate, which isn't present here.\n\nWait, but the way the experiment is set up is that both types are present in the same solution. So if both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage (Mutant B) would lyse the E. coli, regardless of whether it's lysogenic or not. But in reality, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; it integrates and allows replication. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are considered to be either lysogenic or non-integrating. Maybe Mutant A is a non-integrating phage (Type A) which integrates upon infection, becoming a lysogen and lyzing the cell. Mutant B is a lysogenic phage that doesn't lyze but integrates and allows replication. So when mixed together, only the non-integrating phage (Mutant A) causes the lysogeny effect because the integrating phage (Mutant B) can't lyse.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the lysogenic phage would lyse the cell, but in reality, lysogenic phages don't lyse; they just replicate. So perhaps the confusion arises from terminology.\n\nLet me approach this methodically. The goal is to find the recombination frequency (RF) between the two mutations in the T_4 phage. RF is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{1}{(m+1)(n+1)} } \\]\n\nwhere m is the proportion of one mutation type and n the proportion of the other. Alternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{(m+n)^2}{(m+1)(n+1)} - 1 \\]\n\nBut I think the basic formula is:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{1}{(m+1)(n+1)} } \\]\n\nWhere m is the frequency of one mutation, n the other. Alternatively, depending on how the data is presented.\n\nGiven the experimental results, we can calculate the probabilities of each mutation occurring and then determine their combination.\n\nEach plate is treated with a certain concentration of phages. For example, in the first scenario, a concentration of 1:10^7 is used, and another of 1:10^5.\n\nWhen the E. coli is plated on strain B's lawn, the number of plumes indicates the number of successfully lysed cells. Similarly for strain K.\n\nFrom the problem, when both mutants are present (i.e., the concentration is 1:10^7), the E. coli is halved into two halves: one half is plated on strain B's lawn (resulting in 40 plumes) and the other half is plated on strain K's lawn (resulting in 4 plumes).\n\nSimilarly, when only the mutation is present (concentration 1:10^5), the E. coli is plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 4 plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the data provided.\n\nAt 1:10^7 concentration:\n\n- Strain B lawn: 40 plumes\n- Strain K lawn: 4 plumes\n\nAt 1:10^5 concentration:\n\n- Strain B lawn: 4 plumes\n- Strain K lawn: ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps at 1:10^5 concentration, the E. coli is halved again, but the problem describes it as \"plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B\" and \"plated on strain K\". So perhaps at 1:10^7, both mutants are present, and the results are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. At 1:10^5, only one mutation is present, and the results are 4 plumes on B.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact interpretation, so perhaps I should proceed with what I know.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections where the phage lysed the E. coli. So higher numbers mean more successful lysis.\n\nThe expected number of plumes depends on the concentrations and the frequencies of the mutations. Since the phages are randomly distributed, the probability of a phage infecting a cell is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the phage and the target cell's susceptibility.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently, the probability of a phage carrying either mutation is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product (for recombination).\n\nLet me denote:\n\np_A = probability of mutation A (non-integrating, thus lysogenic)\np_B = probability of mutation B (integrating, thus lysogen)\n\nWe need to find the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of cases where both mutations occur.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both mutants are present, only the lysogenic phage (which is mutation B) causes an issue. That suggests that when both are present, only mutation B leads to the issue, implying that mutation A doesn't cause any problem in the presence of mutation B.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lytic phage (mutation B) causes the E. coli to lyse. But in reality, lysogenic phages don't lyse; they just replicate. So perhaps the problem is using \"lysis\" incorrectly, confusing lysogenic and non-integrating phages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are considered to behave as follows:\n\n- Mutation A: Integrates and becomes a lysogen (lytic, which lyse the cell)\n- Mutation B: Does not integrate and remains lytic (but doesn't lyse the cell, just replicates)\n\nIf that's the case, then when both mutants are present, only mutation B (non-integrating) causes the issue, whereas mutation A (integrating) does nothing. Hence, in the experiment, when both are present, only mutation B affects the E. coli, resulting in the observed outcome.\n\nTherefore, the presence of mutation A (integrating) doesn't cause any issue when both mutants are present, suggesting that it doesn't contribute to the recombination.\n\nBut the problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of two different mutations in the same gene locus, particularly in transduction events.\n\nIf recombination occurred, it would mean that both mutations are present in a single phage, leading to the expression of the recombinant protein. However, in our experiment, when both mutants are present, neither mutation alone affects the outcome. Instead, the interaction may lead to lethality.\n\nLooking at the experimental data, when both mutants are present (1:10^7), the E. coli is halved into two halves: one half is plated on strain B's lawn (40 plumes), and the other on strain K's (4 plumes). Similarly, when only one mutation is present (1:10^5), the E. coli is plated on strain B's lawn with 4 plumes.\n\nThis suggests that when only one mutation is present, the number of plumes corresponds to the occurrence of that mutation. For example, in the 1:10^5 treatment, only 4 cells were lysed, indicating the presence of mutation B.\n\nBut when both mutations are present, the number of plumes increases significantly. On strain B, it's 40, which is much higher than the 4 on strain K. This suggests that the combined presence of both mutations causes a severe effect, possibly due to recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nEach mutation contributes to the overall probability of the combination. The expected number of plumes when both mutations are present would depend on the product of their probabilities.\n\nAssuming independence, the expected number of plumes (E) when both mutations are present is:\n\nE = (1/10^7 + p_A + p_B + p_A*p_B) * N\n\nWhere N is the total number of cells.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps a better approach is to assume that the number of plumes reflects the number of successful infections. If both mutations are present, the probability of a phage infecting a cell is the product of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nq_A = probability of mutation A\nq_B = probability of mutation B\n\nSince each phage is independent, the probability of a phage carrying either mutation is q_A + q_B - q_A*q_B (to account for recombination). However, in our experiment, the number of plumes increased significantly when both mutations are present, indicating that the combination caused a lethal effect.\n\nThe expected number of plumes when both mutations are present is likely higher than when only one mutation is present. From the data:\n\nWhen only mutation B is present (1:10^5), 4 plumes are observed on strain B.\n\nWhen both mutations are present (1:10^7), 40 plumes are observed on strain B.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful infections, increasing the number of plumes.\n\nThe ratio of plumes in the presence of both mutations compared to only one mutation gives an idea of the interaction.\n\nRatio = 40 / 4 = 10.\n\nThis implies that the interaction (recombination) caused a tenfold increase in the number of plumes when both mutations are present.\n\nRecombination frequency can be approximated by considering the change in plume count. However, this might not directly translate to RF.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of plumes as a function of the probabilities of each mutation. Let\u2019s suppose that without any mutation, all phages are non-integrating, so the probability of infection is q_non-integrating = 1 / (10^7 + 1), assuming uniform distribution.\n\nBut this line of thinking is getting too convoluted without clear mathematical relationships.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the number of plumes when both mutations are present is 10 times higher than when only one mutation is present. This suggests that the combination of both mutations is lethal and that their interaction leads to a significant increase in the number of successful infections.\n\nIn terms of recombination frequency, the presence of both mutations in the same phage leads to lethality. The calculation for RF typically involves determining the fraction of cells that express the recombinant protein. However, in this case, the lethality is linked to the interaction of both mutations, rather than the expression of a recombinant protein.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would correspond to the likelihood that both mutations occurred in the same phage molecule, leading to lethality.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the increase in plumes when both mutations are present suggests that the interaction is significant. To estimate RF, we can look at the ratio of plumes in the presence of both mutations compared to the absence of either.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for RF when two mutations are involved:\n\n\\[ RF = \\frac{1}{(m+1)(n+1)} } \\]\n\nWhere m and n are the fractions of cells expressing each mutation.\n\nBut without knowing the actual frequencies, it's challenging to compute.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is around 1%, corresponding to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Strain K has higher recombination rate, so more phages should cause issues here as well. Here, 40 pluses were found on strain B.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination refers to how much two mutations interact. Since only the lysogenic phage was effective against strain B, any interaction must have occurred within the lysogenic phage. But wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't be affected by itself; it should handle the lysogenic phage mutation. So maybe the question is about whether the two phages affect each other or if their presence interacts in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If the lysogenic phage carries a mutation, it might interfere with the lysogenic phage. Or perhaps the experiment is testing if the two phages can coexist without interference. Since only the lysogenic phage was effective against strain B, the presence of the lysogenic phage would interfere with the lysogenic phage in the other half. That suggests that some recombination happened, allowing the lysogenic phage to handle its own mutation better than another phage without it.\n\nIn the first half, the lysogenic phage caused 4 plasmid insertions on strain B. In the second half, the same lysogenic phage caused 40 plasmid insertions on strain B. So the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10.

However, none of the options match that exactly. Wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the expected number of plasmids under the assumption of no recombination and compare it to what was observed. For the first half (low dilution), the expectation would be \u03bb = n * p, where n is the total phage number and p is the probability of carrying the mutation. Similarly, for the second half (high dilution), the expectation is different because the phage concentration is lower.\n\nBut given the numbers provided, I think the simplest way is to recognize that the ratio of plasmids in the two groups is 1:10, meaning that 10% of the phages from the high-dilution group carried the mutation. Therefore, the recombination rate is 10%, but since the options don't include 10%, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations.

The ratio of plasmids in the two plates is 4 (first half) : 40 (second half) \u2192 1:10. This implies that 1 out of every 10 phages from the second half had the mutation. So the recombination frequency is 1/10 = 10%. But since the options don't have 10%, I must reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the percentage of plasmids that were contributed by the mutation rather than the recombination rate. Alternatively, maybe the correct calculation involves using the formula for recombination frequency in such experiments, considering the dilution factors.\n\nLet me try calculating it. Suppose in the first half, the number of plasmids per phage is 4. In the second half, it's 40. The ratio is 4:40=1:10. Assuming each phage contributes an average of x plasmids, then:\n\nFor the first half:\nn1 = 4 / x\n\nFor the second half:\nn2 = 40 / x\n\nSince the total number of phages is proportional to 1/dilution factor, n1 = N * 1e7 and n2 = N * 1e5. But this approach complicates things.\n\nInstead, let's use the fact that the difference in plasmid counts reflects the effect of recombination. The expected plasmid count without recombination would be similar, but with recombination, it increases.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the expected plasmid contribution from the high-dilution phage is (1 + r)/2 and from the low-dilution is (1 - r)/2. But I'm not sure about this approach either.\n\nGiven the confusion and time constraints, I'll go with the initial observation that the ratio is 1:10, leading to a 10% recombination rate, but since the options don't include 10%, I must choose the closest. The highest option below 10% is F (0.3%), but that seems too low. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question and it's about the percentage of the population that shows recombination, which would be 10%, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the difference in plasmid counts indicates the presence of recombination. If the ratio is 1:10, then the fraction of phages that carried the mutation is 1/10, so recombination frequency is 10%. Again, this isn't among the options.

So, it looks like the lysogenic phage successfully killed some of the B cells, while the lytic phage didn't affect as many or even caused some death. \n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of genetic information from different sources, which affects how the phages integrate their mutations. If there was no recombination, each mutation would act independently. If there was complete recombination, their effects would combine perfectly. Since the lysogenic phage killed more than the lytic one, it suggests some interaction, but we need to quantify it.\n\nIn experiments like this, the number of recombinants (cells that die) can be used to estimate the probability of recombination. The formula often used is something like (number of recombinants)/(total number of viable offspring), multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. \n\nHere, the total number of viable offspring is 40 + 4 = 44. Out of these, 4 died due to recombination. So, 4/44 is approximately 9%, which isn't an option here. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the calculation should consider the possible outcomes if there were full recombination. Full recombination would mean all lysogenic phages integrate into lysogenic phage particles, leading to maximum effect. In reality, since some lysogenic and some lytic phages are present, the actual number of recombinant cells depends on the proportion of each type that integrated.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination, not the exact number. Recombination events are rare, typically less than 1% in most cases. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible, especially considering that only a few plasmids might have recombined. Alternatively, D is 0.1%, which is also low but lower. However, the experiment shows significant activity against B, suggesting some recombination occurred, though not nearly enough to reach higher percentages.\n\nWait, another approach: The ratio of lysogenic to lytic phages might indicate the likelihood of integration. If the lysogenic phage kills more, it suggests that some of its genes integrated well, possibly without full integration, leading to partial recombination. But the precise calculation isn't straightforward without more data on the frequency of each phage type.\n\nConsidering the options, 0.05% (option J) and 0.02% (option I) seem too low, while 0.3% (F) is closer to what I calculated earlier. Maybe I should double-check. If 4 out of 44 died, that's about 9%, but perhaps I should adjust for the fact that only a fraction of the cells were affected. Alternatively, the correct method involves calculating the expected number of recombinants based on the presence of each phage type.\n\nAnother way: If the lysogenic phage integrates partially, say at 0.3%, then the number of recombinant cells would be proportional to that percentage. For example, 0.3% of 44 gives around 1.32, but we observed 4 deaths. That's inconsistent. Alternatively, if the percentage is lower, say 0.1%, then 0.1% of 44 is 0.44, still less than 4. Hmm, this isn't matching up. Perhaps my initial assumption was wrong, and the correct approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmid copies or the efficiency of integration must be considered. If the recombination rate is high, fewer plasmids would integrate. Given that the result is a division where only some cells died, the recombination must be minimal. Among the options, 0.05% (J) and 0.02% (I) are very low, but perhaps the correct answer is F, 0.3%. I think I'll go with F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains split into halves. One half is then plated on strain B's lawn, and the other on strain K. \n\nThe results show four pluses on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's. So, it looks like the lysogenic phage successfully killed some of the B cells, while the lytic phage didn't affect as many or even caused some death. \n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of genetic information from different sources, which affects how the phages integrate their mutations. If there was no recombination, each mutation would act independently. If there was complete recombination, their effects would combine perfectly. Since the lysogenic phage killed more than the lytic one, it suggests some interaction, but we need to quantify it.\n\nIn experiments like this, the number of recombinants (cells that die) can be used to estimate the probability of recombination. The formula often used is something like (number of recombinants)/(total number of viable offspring), multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. \n\nHere, the total number of viable offspring is 40 + 4 = 44. Out of these, 4 died due to recombination. So, 4/44 is approximately 9%, which isn't an option here. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the calculation should consider the possible outcomes if there were full recombination. Full recombination would mean all lysogenic phages integrate into lysogenic phage particles, leading to maximum effect. In reality, since some lysogenic and some lytic phages are present, the actual number of recombinant cells depends on the proportion of each type that integrated.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination, not the exact number. Recombination events are rare, typically less than 1% in most cases. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible, especially considering that only a few plasmids might have recombined. Alternatively, D is 0.1%, which is also low but lower. However, the experiment shows significant activity against B, suggesting some recombination occurred, though not nearly enough to reach higher percentages.\n\nWait, another approach: The ratio of lysogenic to lytic phages might indicate the likelihood of integration. If the lysogenic phage kills more, it suggests that some of its genes integrated well, possibly without full integration, leading to partial recombination. But the precise calculation isn't straightforward without more data on the frequency of each phage type.\n\nConsidering the options, 0.05% (option J) and 0.02% (option I) seem too low, while 0.3% (F) is closer to what I calculated earlier. Maybe I should double-check. If 4 out of 44 died, that's about 9%, but perhaps I should adjust for the fact that only a fraction of the cells were affected. Alternatively, the correct method involves calculating the expected number of recombinants based on the presence of each phage type.\n\nAnother way: If the lysogenic phage integrates partially, say at 0.3%, then the number of recombinant cells would be proportional to that percentage. For example, 0.3% of 44 gives around 1.32, but we observed 4 deaths. That's inconsistent. Alternatively, if the percentage is lower, say 0.1%, then 0.1% of 44 is 0.44, still less than 4. Hmm, this isn't matching up. Perhaps my initial assumption was wrong, and the correct approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmid copies or the efficiency of integration must be considered. If the recombination rate is high, fewer plasmids would integrate. Given that the result is a division where only some cells died, the recombination must be minimal. Among the options, 0.05% (J) and 0.02% (I) are very low, but perhaps the correct answer is F, 0.3%. I think I'll go with F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

If each phage type has a mutation causing different outcomes, the presence of both should increase the chance of the lysogenic phage doing its thing because it doesn't lyse. So, when testing against B, we expect more plasmid loss due to the lysogenic phage. Similarly, testing against K would give us some data too, maybe showing reduced or increased expression depending on where the recombination is.\n\nThe experiment involved plate dilutions: one half was 1:10^7 (so 1/10 million), and the other was 1:10^5. Then these were plated on strains B and K respectively. The counts given were 4 on B and 40 on K. So, in the B test, there are fewer plasmids lost, suggesting less recombination because if there was significant recombination, it might cause more random loss of plasmids. Wait, no\u2014recombination would mean that the mutated phage interacts with the wild-type phage in the same region, leading to more stable interaction. That could lead to either increased or decreased plasmid loss depending on how it affects replication.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since the lysogenic phage isn't affected (it lyses), while the non-lysed phage is, perhaps recombination leads to the lysogenic phage being expressed differently, affecting its replication efficiency. So, if there's recombination, the lysogenic phage might be more effective at replicating within the host, leading to more plasmid loss. Therefore, if you have higher recombination, more plasmids are lost, meaning fewer plasmids remain, which would affect the count.\n\nLooking at the results: In the B test (with lysogenic phage), there are 4 plasmids lost. In the K test (with the non-lysed phage), there are 40 plasmids lost. Since the K test shows a much higher number, it suggests that there's more recombination because the lysogenic phage is more likely to replicate within the host, leading to more plasmid loss. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because recombination usually makes the phage more efficient, not less. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, think about the expected outcome without any recombination. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lose plasmids as much as the non-lysed one, then recombination would explain why the lysogenic phage loses plasmids more often. But in reality, when recombination happens, the phage may become more efficient, so it would replicate better, leading to more plasmids being lost. However, here, the lysogenic phage isn't losing plasmids, while the non-lysed one is. So, maybe recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively, leading to more plasmid loss than expected without recombination.\n\nWait, but in our case, the lysogenic phage isn't losing plasmids, whereas the non-lysed one is. So, if there's recombination, the lysogenic phage might be expressed more efficiently, leading to more plasmid loss. Thus, the lack of plasmid loss in the lysogenic phage indicates that recombination didn't happen, but that contradicts the results because the K test shows more plasmids lost.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that recombination increases the likelihood of the lysogenic phage replicating, thus increasing plasmid loss. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage wouldn't replicate as well, so plasmid loss would be lower. With recombination, it's higher, so more plasmids lost.\n\nIn the B test, we see less plasmid loss than expected, implying no recombination. In the K test, more plasmid loss than expected, suggesting some recombination. But the question asks for the amount of recombination, not whether it's present or not. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother angle: The presence of both mutants means that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, while the non-lysed one does. So, the lysogenic phage might be expressed more efficiently, allowing it to replicate and cause more plasmid loss. This could indicate that recombination is happening, making the lysogenic phage more active. Alternatively, if recombination wasn't occurring, the lysogenic phage would replicate less, leading to less plasmid loss.\n\nSo, looking at the counts: In the B test, 4 plasmids lost; in the K test, 40. So, the B test shows less plasmid loss, which would suggest that recombination didn't occur because the lysogenic phage isn't losing plasmids as much. Conversely, the K test shows more plasmid loss, indicating recombination did occur.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. To find this, we might calculate the recombination frequency or measure the degree of genetic interaction between the two regions.\n\nWait, another approach: The probability of recombination between two sites in a gene region can be estimated using the ratio of plasmid loss rates. If R is the recombination rate, then the expected loss rate with recombination would be proportional to the product of the individual loss rates.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\np = probability of loss in wild-type phage (non-lysed)\nq = probability of loss in lysogenic phage (lysed)\n\nWithout recombination, p * q would be the expected loss rate. With recombination, the actual loss rate could be different.\n\nFrom the experiments:\n\nIn the B test (lysogenic phage):\nPlasmids lost = 4 per million. Assuming the total population is large enough, this is p * q.\n\nIn the K test (non-lysed phage):\nPlasmids lost = 40 per million. This is p' * q', but since the phage is non-lysed, maybe the loss rate is just p'.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Perhaps a simpler way is to use the formula for recombination frequency:\n\nR = 1 - (p * q) / ((p + R) * (q + R))\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the expected plasmid loss in each condition.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expected plasmid loss would be p * q. But if there is recombination, it might change.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the probabilities. Let's assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate as well, so it loses plasmids at a lower rate. With recombination, the lysogenic phage becomes more efficient, so it loses plasmids more often.\n\nGiven that in the B test, the lysogenic phage doesn't lose plasmids (plasmids lost = 0), which implies that recombination happened. Because normally, without recombination, the lysogenic phage would lose plasmids more, so seeing zero plasmid loss suggests recombination.\n\nIn the K test, the lysogenic phage is lost more, so more plasmids lost, which would suggest that recombination increased its replication efficiency, making it more likely to lose plasmids.\n\nBut the problem states that the two mutations are in the same region, so we're measuring their recombination here.\n\nNow, from the experimental data, in the B test, there are 4 plasmids lost, and in K, 40. So, the K test has ten times more plasmids lost than the B test.\n\nAssuming that recombination caused the lysogenic phage to replicate better, leading to more plasmid loss. So, the ratio of plasmid losses between the two tests is 4 vs 40, which is 1:10.\n\nSince the K test has ten times more plasmids lost, and assuming that without recombination, the loss rate would be lower, this suggests a high degree of recombination.\n\nTo estimate the recombination fraction, we can use the formula:\n\nR = (p * q) / (p + q)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that the observed plasmid loss rates can help determine the recombination fraction.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\np = probability of loss in wild-type phage (non-lysed)\nq = probability of loss in lysogenic phage (lysed)\n\nWithout recombination, the expected plasmid loss in the B test would be p * q, and in the K test, p alone.\n\nWith recombination, the expected plasmid loss in the B test would still be p * q, but the K test would now involve recombinant interactions, possibly changing the loss rates.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to set up equations based on the observed plasmid loss.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the loss rate without recombination is p * q.\n\nWhen recombination occurs, the loss rate for the lysogenic phage changes. Suppose that with recombination, the loss rate becomes p * q + R * (1 - p * q), where R is the recombination coefficient (e.g., 98% if 2% recombination).\n\nBut I'm not confident in this approach. Instead, let's consider that in the absence of recombination, the lysogenic phage would lose plasmids at a certain rate, say x. With recombination, it would lose them faster, say y > x.\n\nGiven that in the B test, there's no recombination (since lysogenic phage doesn't lose plasmids), so the expected plasmid loss would be x. But in reality, it's zero, which implies that recombination must be such that the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently without losing plasmids.\n\nTherefore, recombination must have occurred, making the lysogenic phage more efficient at replicating, hence losing more plasmids.\n\nNow, comparing the two tests:\n\nTest B (lysogenic phage): No recombination \u2192 lysogenic phage loses plasmids at rate x.\nTest K (non-lysed phage): Recombination occurs \u2192 lysogenic phage loses plasmids at rate y > x.\n\nGiven that Test B shows no loss (x=0), and Test K shows y=40, which is 10 times higher than x=4.\n\nWait, no, Test B has 4 plasmids lost, and Test K has 40. So, in Test B, it's 4, in Test K, it's 40.\n\nBut if without recombination, the loss rate would be x, and with recombination, it's y. So, if x </think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The first half is diluted 1:10^7, which is pretty high concentration, so any mutations would have low probability of causing issues. This half is then plated on a lawn of strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5, which is lower, meaning there's a higher chance of seeing some mutations. Plated on strain K's lawn, four plaques were found, while four hundred were found on strain B.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you plate on a lawn, if the bacteria can grow, you get multiple colonies. So if the phage mutated, the bacteria might lyse them, giving more colonies. So in this case, for the first half (diluted 1:10^7), since it's a high concentration, maybe there's less chance of any mutation causing issues. So that half probably has fewer mutants or none. The second half (diluted 1:10^5) is where most mutations occur.\n\nNow, the observed results: four plaques on strain K and 40 on B. That suggests that the strain K's lawn had more mutants, perhaps. Wait, no\u2014wait, when you plate on a lawn, the number of mutants that cause lysis determine how many colonies form. If a strain is resistant, it won't lyse and won't form colonies. So if strain K's lawn had more mutants, those mutants would cause lyosis and replicate more, leading to more colonies. Similarly, for strain B, the mutants from the lysogenic phage would lyse the cells, but wait, the lysogenic phage should be stable, right? Or maybe I'm mixing up the effects.\n\nWait, let me think again. The lysogenic phage typically integrates its DNA into the host genome, allowing it to replicate without needing an external source of replication. So if the lysogenic phage causes lysogeny (it becomes stable), it could lyse the host cells during replication, causing them to die and possibly becoming free-lying phages. Alternatively, if it's lysogenic, it's still active and replicates within the host.\n\nBut in this case, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host cells, so if the host is strain B, which is resistant to lysogeny, then it wouldn't lyse. Therefore, the lysogenic phage should not affect strain B, but only the lysogenic phage shouldn't do anything because it's already lysogenic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is stable, so it doesn't lyse the host. So if the host is strain B, which is resistant to lysogeny, then the lysogenic phage wouldn't lyse it, so it wouldn't cause death. But if the host is strain K, which is susceptible to lysogeny, then the lysogenic phage would lyse it, causing it to die and potentially become free-lying phage. But why would the lysogenic phage cause death?\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host genome, making it stable, so when it replicates, it doesn't lyse the host. Therefore, if the host is strain B, which isn't lysogenic-friendly, the lysogenic phage wouldn't lyse it, so it wouldn't cause death. However, if the host is strain K, which is lysogenic-friendly, the lysogenic phage would lyse it, causing it to die and potentially become free-lying. Therefore, in the presence of lysogenic phage, strain B would survive, and strain K would die because their phages lyse them.\n\nBut the experiment shows that when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strains split. The first half was only lysogenic phage (so it shouldn't kill strain B), but it killed some strain K. The second half was only the phage that caused lytic fission (so it shouldn't kill either strain), but since it's at a lower concentration, more mutations may have occurred.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage that causes lytic fission (the one that kills the phage) would lyse the phage inside the host, but if the host is resistant to lysogeny, it would just lyse the phage and become free-lying. If the host is susceptible, it wouldn't lyse, so the phage remains. Therefore, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host if it's resistant, but not if it's susceptible.\n\nSo, back to the problem. In the first half, all the phages are lysogenic, so they don't kill either strain B or K, but they may lyse some of the K cells. In the second half, the phages are lytic, so they lyse the phage inside the host, killing the phage and making it free-lying. Since the phage inside the host doesn't affect the host's ability to replicate, but if the host is resistant to lysogeny, it would lyse the phage and become free-lying. Wait, but lysogeny is about integrating into the host genome. If the host is resistant, it won't lyse; if it's susceptible, it will.\n\nTherefore, in the first half, the lysogenic phages don't kill either strain, but they may lyse some of the K cells. In the second half, the lytic phages lyse the phage inside the host, killing the phage and making it free-lying, but if the host is resistant, it won't lyse. So if the host is susceptible, the phage inside the host won't lyse, so the lysogenic phage doesn't kill the host. But if the host is resistant, the phage inside the host would lyse, killing the host.\n\nBut in the experiment, the first half (lysogenic) was plated on strain B's lawn, so if the lysogenic phages didn't kill B, why did some K cells lyse? Because the lysogenic phages integrated into the K strain's genome, making it resistant, so when they replicated, they couldn't lyse the K cells. Therefore, the lysogenic phage in the first half didn't kill B, but the lysogenic phage in the second half (lytic) would lyse the phage inside the K strain, killing it, so the K cells would die, and the phage would lyse, but since it's lysogenic, it wouldn't lyse the host.\n\nWait, now I'm getting tangled. Maybe I should approach this differently. The key is to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 phage.\n\nWhen both mutant phages are present, each plasmid has a certain mutation rate. If the mutations are independent, the expected recombinant frequency would be (1 - p1 - p2 + q1q2), assuming dominant recombination. But since we're dealing with multiplicative factors, the formula for recombination frequency when both mutations are present is (1 - p1)(1 - p2).\n\nGiven that the test showed four plaques on strain K and 40 on B, and considering the dilution ratios, perhaps the recombination frequency is related to the ratio of the number of mutants.\n\nLet me consider that when both mutations are present, the number of mutants depends on whether they are linked. If they are not linked, the expected number of mutants would be (p1 + p2 - p1p2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if both mutations are on the same chromosome, the recombination fraction would determine the likelihood of having a double mutant.\n\nWait, maybe the number of mutants per sample gives us information about the recombination frequency. For example, if the recombination frequency is r, then the proportion of double mutants would be r. But in this case, the number of mutants on each strain varies, so perhaps it's about the combination of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are independent and non-recombinant, the probability of a double mutant would be p1 * p2. If they are linked, the probability would be (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut in this scenario, the experiment shows that when both types are present, the strain K has more mutants than strain B.

But looking at the options provided, the possible answers are percentages like 0.05% or similar.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that the number of mutants on each strain relates to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of double mutants would be (p1 * p2) / (total possible combinations). But in this case, the total number of plasmids is fixed, so maybe the product of the frequencies of each mutation gives the number of double mutants.\n\nGiven that four mutants are found on strain K and 40 on strain B, perhaps the product of the frequencies of each mutation equals 4/(4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9%, which is close to 0.09, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of mutants to total is proportional to the product of the mutation rates.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the expected number of double mutants being (p1 * p2) when both mutations are present.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B gets half from each type.\n\nThe experiment involves diluting these plasmids into different concentrations. The first half is diluted 1:10^7, which is pretty high concentration, so any mutations would have low probability of causing issues. This half is then plated on a lawn of strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5, which is lower, meaning there's a higher chance of seeing some mutations. Plated on strain K's lawn, four plaques were found, while four hundred were found on strain B.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you plate on a lawn, if the bacteria can grow, you get multiple colonies. So if the phage mutated, the bacteria might lyse them, giving more colonies. So in this case, for the first half (diluted 1:10^7), since it's a high concentration, maybe there's less chance of any mutation causing issues. So that half probably has fewer mutants or none. The second half (diluted 1:10^5) is where most mutations occur.\n\nNow, the observed results: four plaques on strain K and 40 on B. That suggests that the strain K's lawn had more mutants, perhaps. Wait, no\u2014wait, when you plate on a lawn, the number of mutants that cause lysis determine how many colonies form. If a strain is resistant, it won't lyse and won't form colonies. So if strain K's lawn had more mutants, those mutants would cause lyosis and replicate more, leading to more colonies. Similarly, for strain B, the mutants from the lysogenic phage would lyse the cells, but wait, the lysogenic phage should be stable, right? Or maybe I'm mixing up the effects.\n\nWait, let me think again. The lysogenic phage typically integrates its DNA into the host genome, allowing it to replicate without needing an external source of replication. So if the lysogenic phage causes lysogeny (it becomes stable), it could lyse the host cells during replication, causing them to die and possibly becoming free-lying phages. Alternatively, if it's lysogenic, it's still active and replicates within the host.\n\nBut in this case, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host cells, so if the host is strain B, which is resistant to lysogeny, then it wouldn't lyse. Therefore, the lysogenic phage should not affect strain B, but only the lysogenic phage shouldn't do anything because it's already lysogenic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is stable, so it doesn't lyse the host. So if the host is strain B, which is resistant to lysogeny, then the lysogenic phage wouldn't lyse it, so it wouldn't cause death. But if the host is strain K, which is susceptible to lysogeny, then the lysogenic phage would lyse it, causing it to die and potentially become free-lying phage. But why would the lysogenic phage cause death?\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host genome, making it stable, so when it replicates, it doesn't lyse the host. Therefore, if the host is strain B, which isn't lysogenic-friendly, the lysogenic phage wouldn't lyse it, so it wouldn't cause death. However, if the host is strain K, which is lysogenic-friendly, the lysogenic phage would lyse it, causing it to die and potentially become free-lying. Therefore, in the presence of lysogenic phage, strain B would survive, and strain K would die because their phages lyse them.\n\nBut the experiment shows that when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strains split. The first half was only lysogenic phage (so it shouldn't kill strain B), but it killed some strain K. The second half was only the phage that caused lytic fission (so it shouldn't kill either strain), but since it's at a lower concentration, more mutations may have occurred.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage that causes lytic fission (the one that kills the phage) would lyse the phage inside the host, but if the host is resistant to lysogeny, it would just lyse the phage and become free-lying. If the host is susceptible, it wouldn't lyse, so the phage remains. Therefore, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host if it's resistant, but not if it's susceptible.\n\nSo, back to the problem. In the first half, all the phages are lysogenic, so they don't kill either strain B or K, but they may lyse some of the K cells. In the second half, the phages are lytic, so they lyse the phage inside the host, killing the phage and making it free-lying. Since the phage inside the host doesn't affect the host's ability to replicate, but if the host is resistant to lysogeny, it would lyse the phage and become free-lying. Wait, but lysogeny is about integrating into the host genome. If the host is resistant, it won't lyse; if it's susceptible, it will.\n\nTherefore, in the first half, the lysogenic phages don't kill either strain, but they may lyse some of the K cells. In the second half, the lytic phages lyse the phage inside the host, killing the phage and making it free-lying, but if the host is resistant, it won't lyse. So if the host is susceptible, the phage inside the host won't lyse, so the lysogenic phage doesn't kill the host. But if the host is resistant, the phage inside the host would lyse, killing the host.\n\nBut in the experiment, the first half (lysogenic) was plated on strain B's lawn, so if the lysogenic phages didn't kill B, why did some K cells lyse? Because the lysogenic phages integrated into the K strain's genome, making it resistant, so when they replicated, they couldn't lyse the K cells. Therefore, the lysogenic phage in the first half didn't kill B, but the lysogenic phage in the second half (lytic) would lyse the phage inside the K strain, killing it, so the K cells would die, and the phage would lyse, but since it's lysogenic, it wouldn't lyse the host.\n\nWait, now I'm getting tangled.

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a strain K lawn. After incubation, there are four pluses on K and 40 on B. My goal is to find the percentage of recombination between these two mutations.\n\nHmm, I remember that recombination refers to how often the two mutation sites occur together. If they're tightly linked, their occurrence is positively correlated; if unlinked, they might be randomly distributed. In phage genetics, tight linkage usually leads to higher expression or more severe effects because the mutations happen close together.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutantphages are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli. So in the divided sample, half of it is lysogenic and half is not. When this half is plated on strain B, only a small number of pluses form, which suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't effective against strain B. Wait, no\u2014the problem says the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, so maybe the lysogenic phage should be effective? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the results.\n\nWait, let me read again. The initial infection by two types of mutantphages\u2014so some cells have the lysogenic mutation (they don't lyse), others have the lytic mutation (they do). When they infect strain B, only the lysogenic ones die. So in the divided sample, the half with the lysogenic mutation would die, and the other half would replicate without issues. Then, when this is plated on strain B's lawn, we expect fewer pluses because the lysogenic phage isn't causing any effect. However, the result was four pluses, which seems low. But then another part is plated on strain K, where 40 pluses appeared. That must mean that the lysogenic phage did affect the K strain, as it had more pluses.\n\nSo, the half that dies (lysogenic mutation) didn't contribute to the K lawn, but contributed to the B lawn. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is linked to the B strain but not to the K strain. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage has a certain chromosomal arrangement that allows it to infect K but not B.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination typically happens at a specific point along the chromosome. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the frequency of co-infection will increase. Here, the presence of lysogenic phage reduces the number of pluses on B (because lysogenic phages shouldn't affect B), meaning that the lysogenic phage is not linked to B. Similarly, the lysogenic phage affects K, implying it's linked to K.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, the expected outcome would be that the lysogenic phage would also affect B, leading to more pluses on B than what was observed. Instead, we saw fewer pluses on B, suggesting less recombination. Conversely, since the lysogenic phage caused more pluses on K, it must be that the lysogenic phage is more likely to be present in the K strain.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: On B, four pluses were found from the half that died, and on K, 40 pluses were found from the half that survived. The total pool for B is dilution 1:10^7, so the concentration is much lower, making the pluses rare. For K, dilution 1:10^5 makes the concentration even lower.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently except for recombination, the probability of both mutations occurring in a single phage is related to the recombination frequency (RF). RF is calculated as (1 - e^{-2R}), where R is the recombination fraction. So, if we can estimate R, we can find the RF.\n\nIn this case, the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the B half doesn't lead to pluses, while the presence in the K half does. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is linked to K but not to B. Therefore, the RF is low, indicating that the two mutations are not tightly linked.\n\nTo calculate the RF, we can use the formula:\n\nRF = 1 - e^{-(1/N)(number of recombinant events)}\n\nWhere N is the total number of offspring. Since each half is split, and the pluses indicate successful infection, we can model it as a binomial distribution.\n\nFor the B half, the number of pluses is 4, and for K, it's 40. Assuming each half is equally likely to produce pluses, we can approximate the expected number based on RF.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nNumber of pluses on B = N_B * (1 - e^{-2R})\n\nAnd similarly for K:\n\nNumber of pluses on K = N_K * (1 - e^{-2R})\n\nSince N_B and N_K are different (dilutions 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), we can set up equations to solve for R.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nN_B = 10^7 (for B half)\nN_K = 10^5 (for K half)\n\nNumber of pluses on B (P_B) = 4\nNumber of pluses on K (P_K) = 40\n\nUsing the approximation for small R (since pluses are rare):\n\nP \u2248 N * (1 - 2R + 2R^2)\n\nNeglecting higher-order terms beyond R\u00b2, which may not be necessary here.\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u2248 10^7 * (1 - 2R)\n40 \u2248 10^5 * (1 - 2R)\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n(4 / 40) \u2248 (10^7 / 10^5) * ((1 - 2R)/(1 - 2R))\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.1 \u2248 100 * 1 \u2192 0.1 \u2248 100, which is impossible. Hmm, that suggests my approach might be flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, considering the likelihood of each event:\n\nThe probability of a plasmid carrying both mutations is R. For the B half, the chance of having a plasmid with both mutations is negligible, hence fewer pluses. For the K half, the chance is higher.\n\nSo, for the B half:\n\nP_B = N_B * R \u2248 4\nFor the K half:\nP_K = N_K * R \u2248 40\n\nBut this would imply that P_K = 10*P_B, which contradicts unless R is high, but that doesn\u2019t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is different.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the expected number of pluses in each sample is proportional to R. So:\n\nP_B = k * R\nP_K = m * R\n\nWhere k and m are constants depending on dilution factors. Given that N_B = 1e7 and N_K = 1e5, and P_B=4, P_K=40, we can write:\n\nk * R = 4\nm * R = 40\n\nThus, dividing the second equation by the first gives:\n\n(m/k) = 10\n\nThis suggests that the dilution factor for K is ten times that of B, which aligns with the given data (1e5 vs 1e7).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of pluses is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Since P_B = 4 and P_K = 40, which is exactly 10x higher, the dilution factor is consistent.\n\nGiven that, we can express R as:\n\nR = P_B / k = (4) / k\n\nSimilarly, R = P_K / m = 40/m\n\nFrom the above, 4/k = 40/m \u2192 m = 10k\n\nAlso, since P_B = k*R and P_K = m*R, substituting m=10k:\n\nP_K = 10k * R\n\nBut P_K =40, and k*R=4 \u2192 40 =10*(4) \u2192 40=40, which holds true.\n\nSo, now, solving for R:\n\nFrom P_B = k*R =4 \u2192 k=R/4\n\nSubstituting into P_K:\n\nP_K =10k*R =10*(R/4)*R= (10/4)*R\u00b2=2.5 R\u00b2\n\nBut P_K=40, so:\n\n2.5 R\u00b2=40 \u2192 R\u00b2=16 \u2192 R=4\n\nWait, that can't be right because R is supposed to be a small value (less than 1% or similar). R=4 implies a high recombination frequency, which contradicts our earlier observation that the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B.\n\nThis suggests an error in the reasoning. Perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the B half leads to fewer pluses, implying that the lysogenic phage is tightly linked to B. Conversely, its presence in the K half leads to more pluses, suggesting it's loosely linked to K.\n\nRecombination frequency (RF) measures the proportion of double crossovers. For two linked genes, RF = p*q, where p and q are the frequencies of each gene. Here, R is the RF, and we need to find it.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B, the RF must be such that the lysogenic phage cannot cross between B and K. Thus, the lysogenic phage is tightly linked to B but not to K.\n\nThe presence of the lysogenic phage in the B half doesn't cause any pluses because it doesn't lyse B, whereas in the K half, it causes pluses. This indicates that the lysogenic phage is more likely to exist in the K strain but not in the B strain. Therefore, the RF is low, likely around 1-10%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1%  \nB. 2%  \nC. 1.5%  \nD. 0.1%  \nE. 0.2%  \nF. 0.3%  \nG. 0.5%  \nH. 5%  \nI. 0.02%  \nJ. 0.05%  \nK. 0.0000000002%\n\nWait, the options include F (0.3%) and J (0.05%). Based on my previous calculation, R=4 led to a high RF, which conflicts with the observations. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D (0.1%) because the presence of the lysogenic phage is more common in K but not in B, indicating a lower RF.\n\nWait, another thought: the pluses on B are 4, and on K are 40. The ratio is 1:10, which corresponds to the inverse of the dilution factors (1e7 vs 1e5). Dilution factor is 10x, so the likelihood of recombination is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Hence, RF is approximately 1/(dilution factor). For B, dilution factor is 1e7, so RF\u22481e-7, which is extremely low, but this contradicts the results.\n\nAlternatively, thinking that the recombination fraction is approximately equal to the ratio of pluses on K to B: 40/4=10. So, R=10%, which is option G (0.5%). Hmm, but 10% is quite high, and the pluses are few on B, suggesting a low RF.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the number of pluses relates to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring in each phage. If the two mutations are tightly linked, their probabilities multiply. If they're not linked, the probabilities add.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nProbability of lysogenic phage in B: p_B\nProbability of lysogenic phage in K: p_K\n\nIf tightly linked, the probability of both occurring is p_L = p_B * p_K\n\nThen, the expected number of pluses in B would be proportional to p_L, and in K as well, but scaled differently due to dilution.\n\nGiven that P_B = 4 and P_K=40, and assuming dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5, respectively, we can relate them as:\n\nP_B \u221d p_L * N_B\nP_K \u221d p_L * N_K\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nP_B / P_K = (p_L * N_B) / (p_L * N_K) )= N_B / N_K\n\nSo, 4 / 40 = 1e7 / 1e5 \u2192 0.1 = 100 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption of additive probabilities is incorrect. Instead, perhaps the probabilities are independent, and the combined probability is p_L = p_B * p_K.\n\nBut given that, the expected number of pluses would scale as p_L * N, which would still require the same ratio as before. Therefore, the only way to reconcile the ratios is if either p_L varies with dilution, which complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the probability of recombination is R, and the number of pluses depends on R. If the two mutations are tightly linked, R is small, say ~1%. If they\u2019re loose, R is larger.\n\nGiven the data, the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B (few pluses) but affects K (more pluses).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal parts, each being half the original. \n\nThen, half of this divided sample is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a strain B lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a strain K lawn. After incubation, there are four pluses on K and 40 on B. My goal is to find the percentage of recombination between these two mutations.\n\nHmm, I remember that recombination refers to how often the two mutation sites occur together. If they're tightly linked, their occurrence is positively correlated; if unlinked, they might be randomly distributed. In phage genetics, tight linkage usually leads to higher expression or more severe effects because the mutations happen close together.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutantphages are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli. So in the divided sample, half of it is lysogenic and half is not. When this half is plated on strain B, only a small number of pluses form, which suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't effective against strain B. Wait, no\u2014the problem says the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, so maybe the lysogenic phage should be effective? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the results.\n\nWait, let me read again. The initial infection by two types of mutantphages\u2014so some cells have the lysogenic mutation (they don't lyse), others have the lytic mutation (they do). When they infect strain B, only the lysogenic ones die. So in the divided sample, the half with the lysogenic mutation would die, and the other half would replicate without issues. Then, when this is plated on strain B's lawn, we expect fewer pluses because the lysogenic phage isn't causing any effect. However, the result was four pluses, which seems low. But then another part is plated on strain K, where 40 pluses appeared. That must mean that the lysogenic phage did affect the K strain, as it had more pluses.\n\nSo, the half that dies (lysogenic mutation) didn't contribute to the K lawn, but contributed to the B lawn. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is linked to the B strain but not to the K strain. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage has a certain chromosomal arrangement that allows it to infect K but not B.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination typically happens at a specific point along the chromosome. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the frequency of co-infection will increase. Here, the presence of lysogenic phage reduces the number of pluses on B (because lysogenic phages shouldn't affect B), meaning that the lysogenic phage is not linked to B. Similarly, the lysogenic phage affects K, implying it's linked to K.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, the expected outcome would be that the lysogenic phage would also affect B, leading to more pluses on B than what was observed. Instead, we saw fewer pluses on B, suggesting less recombination. Conversely, since the lysogenic phage caused more pluses on K, it must be that the lysogenic phage is more likely to be present in the K strain.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: On B, four pluses were found from the half that died, and on K, 40 pluses were found from the half that survived. The total pool for B is dilution 1:10^7, so the concentration is much lower, making the pluses rare. For K, dilution 1:10^5 makes the concentration even lower.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently except for recombination, the probability of both mutations occurring in a single phage is related to the recombination frequency (RF). RF is calculated as (1 - e^{-2R}), where R is the recombination fraction. So, if we can estimate R, we can find the RF.\n\nIn this case, the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the B half doesn't lead to pluses, while the presence in the K half does. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is linked to K but not to B. Therefore, the RF is low, indicating that the two mutations are not tightly linked.\n\nTo calculate the RF, we can use the formula:\n\nRF = 1 - e^{-(1/N)(number of recombinant events)}\n\nWhere N is the total number of offspring. Since each half is split, and the pluses indicate successful infection, we can model it as a binomial distribution.\n\nFor the B half, the number of pluses is 4, and for K, it's 40. Assuming each half is equally likely to produce pluses, we can approximate the expected number based on RF.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nNumber of pluses on B = N_B * (1 - e^{-2R})\n\nAnd similarly for K:\n\nNumber of pluses on K = N_K * (1 - e^{-2R})\n\nSince N_B and N_K are different (dilutions 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), we can set up equations to solve for R.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nN_B = 10^7 (for B half)\nN_K = 10^5 (for K half)\n\nNumber of pluses on B (P_B) = 4\nNumber of pluses on K (P_K) = 40\n\nUsing the approximation for small R (since pluses are rare):\n\nP \u2248 N * (1 - 2R + 2R^2)\n\nNeglecting higher-order terms beyond R\u00b2, which may not be necessary here.\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u2248 10^7 * (1 - 2R)\n40 \u2248 10^5 * (1 - 2R)\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n(4 / 40) \u2248 (10^7 / 10^5) * ((1 - 2R)/(1 - 2R))\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.1 \u2248 100 * 1 \u2192 0.1 \u2248 100, which is impossible. Hmm, that suggests my approach might be flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, considering the likelihood of each event:\n\nThe probability of a plasmid carrying both mutations is R. For the B half, the chance of having a plasmid with both mutations is negligible, hence fewer pluses. For the K half, the chance is higher.\n\nSo, for the B half:\n\nP_B = N_B * R \u2248 4\nFor the K half:\nP_K = N_K * R \u2248 40\n\nBut this would imply that P_K = 10*P_B, which contradicts unless R is high, but that doesn\u2019t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is different.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the expected number of pluses in each sample is proportional to R. So:\n\nP_B = k * R\nP_K = m * R\n\nWhere k and m are constants depending on dilution factors. Given that N_B = 1e7 and N_K = 1e5, and P_B=4, P_K=40, we can write:\n\nk * R = 4\nm * R = 40\n\nThus, dividing the second equation by the first gives:\n\n(m/k) = 10\n\nThis suggests that the dilution factor for K is ten times that of B, which aligns with the given data (1e5 vs 1e7).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of pluses is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Since P_B = 4 and P_K = 40, which is exactly 10x higher, the dilution factor is consistent.\n\nGiven that, we can express R as:\n\nR = P_B / k = (4) / k\n\nSimilarly, R = P_K / m = 40/m\n\nFrom the above, 4/k = 40/m \u2192 m = 10k\n\nAlso, since P_B = k*R and P_K = m*R, substituting m=10k:\n\nP_K = 10k * R\n\nBut P_K =40, and k*R=4 \u2192 40 =10*(4) \u2192 40=40, which holds true.\n\nSo, now, solving for R:\n\nFrom P_B = k*R =4 \u2192 k=R/4\n\nSubstituting into P_K:\n\nP_K =10k*R =10*(R/4)*R= (10/4)*R\u00b2=2.5 R\u00b2\n\nBut P_K=40, so:\n\n2.5 R\u00b2=40 \u2192 R\u00b2=16 \u2192 R=4\n\nWait, that can't be right because R is supposed to be a small value (less than 1% or similar). R=4 implies a high recombination frequency, which contradicts our earlier observation that the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B.\n\nThis suggests an error in the reasoning. Perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the B half leads to fewer pluses, implying that the lysogenic phage is tightly linked to B. Conversely, its presence in the K half leads to more pluses, suggesting it's loosely linked to K.\n\nRecombination frequency (RF) measures the proportion of double crossovers. For two linked genes, RF = p*q, where p and q are the frequencies of each gene. Here, R is the RF, and we need to find it.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B, the RF must be such that the lysogenic phage cannot cross between B and K. Thus, the lysogenic phage is tightly linked to B but not to K.\n\nThe presence of the lysogenic phage in the B half doesn't cause any pluses because it doesn't lyse B, whereas in the K half, it causes pluses. This indicates that the lysogenic phage is more likely to exist in the K strain but not in the B strain. Therefore, the RF is low, likely around 1-10%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1%  \nB. 2%  \nC. 1.5%  \nD. 0.1%  \nE. 0.2%  \nF. 0.3%  \nG. 0.5%  \nH. 5%  \nI. 0.02%  \nJ. 0.05%  \nK. 0.0000000002%\n\nWait, the options include F (0.3%) and J (0.05%). Based on my previous calculation, R=4 led to a high RF, which conflicts with the observations. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D (0.1%) because the presence of the lysogenic phage is more common in K but not in B, indicating a lower RF.\n\nWait, another thought: the pluses on B are 4, and on K are 40. The ratio is 1:10, which corresponds to the inverse of the dilution factors (1e7 vs 1e5). Dilution factor is 10x, so the likelihood of recombination is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Hence, RF is approximately 1/(dilution factor). For B, dilution factor is 1e7, so RF\u22481e-7, which is extremely low, but this contradicts the results.\n\nAlternatively, thinking that the recombination fraction is approximately equal to the ratio of pluses on K to B: 40/4=10. So, R=10%, which is option G (0.5%). Hmm, but 10% is quite high, and the pluses are few on B, suggesting a low RF.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the number of pluses relates to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring in each phage. If the two mutations are tightly linked, their probabilities multiply. If they're not linked, the probabilities add.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nProbability of lysogenic phage in B: p_B\nProbability of lysogenic phage in K: p_K\n\nIf tightly linked, the probability of both occurring is p_L = p_B * p_K\n\nThen, the expected number of pluses in B would be proportional to p_L, and in K as well, but scaled differently due to dilution.\n\nGiven that P_B = 4 and P_K=40, and assuming dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5, respectively, we can relate them as:\n\nP_B \u221d p_L * N_B\nP_K \u221d p_L * N_K\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nP_B / P_K = (p_L * N_B) / (p_L * N_K) )= N_B / N_K\n\nSo, 4 / 40 = 1e7 / 1e5 \u2192 0.1 = 100 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption of additive probabilities is incorrect. Instead, perhaps the probabilities are independent, and the combined probability is p_L = p_B * p_K.\n\nBut given that, the expected number of pluses would scale as p_L * N, which would still require the same ratio as before. Therefore, the only way to reconcile the ratios is if either p_L varies with dilution, which complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the probability of recombination is R, and the number of pluses depends on R. If the two mutations are tightly linked, R is small, say ~1%. If they\u2019re loose, R is larger.\n\nGiven the data, the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B (few pluses) but affects K (more pluses). Therefore, the lysogenic phage is linked to K but not to B. Thus, the recombination frequency is likely low.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is H (5%), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the exact RF is determined by the ratio of pluses on K to B: 40/4=10. If RF is 10%, that's a lot, but given the data, perhaps the correct RF is 5%.\n\nHowever, without precise calculations, it's challenging.

The results showed four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I think this has to do with how the mutations interact during replication. If the two mutations recombine, their effects might interfere with each other. Since only the lysogenic phage caused issues, maybe the recombination led them to behave more like one type or the other.\n\nIn E. coli, if a mutation leads to a dominant effect, recombination could either enhance or suppress those effects.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets halved, which suggests some selection or segregation happening.\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the population into two groups: one where the phages are at a dilution of 1:10^7 and another at 1:10^5. These are then plated onto different bacterial strains\u2014strain B for the first group and strain K for the second. The results showed four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I think this has to do with how the mutations interact during replication. If the two mutations recombine, their effects might interfere with each other. Since only the lysogenic phage caused issues, maybe the recombination led them to behave more like one type or the other.\n\nIn E. coli, if a mutation leads to a dominant effect, recombination could either enhance or suppress those effects. For example, if a mutation makes a phage active and another makes it non-inactive, recombination might make them both inactive or both active, depending on where they occurred.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 40 pluses on K and 4 on B suggest that the strain K had fewer plasmids carrying the recombined mutation. This implies that the recombination was less likely to occur there. Maybe the higher dilution (1:10^5) allows more chance for recombination compared to the lower dilution (1:10^7), as more cells are exposed to the environment.\n\nIf the two mutations were completely independent, we'd expect certain ratios, but here the ratio isn't consistent, indicating some interaction.

This means there's a dilution factor of 1e7, which is a lot, so we expect fewer plasmids. Then, another half is diluted 1:10^5, and plated on strain K. The results were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that when you have recombinant elements, the number of successful combinations depends on the proportion of each mutation. If the two mutations recombine, then certain cells will have both mutations instead of just one. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage affected strain B, maybe the other half has a different combination. \n\nWait, no, the lysogenic phage shouldn't recombine. So if the recombination occurs, some cells would have both mutations, others none, or perhaps just one. But since only the lysogenic was bad, maybe the other half didn't experience any recombination. \n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes. Without any recombination, all cells from the first half should show the same pattern as strain B, right? And without recombination, the second half would also be similar. But here, the first half shows more plasmids than the second. That suggests that the first half had more copies, meaning higher recombination. \n\nBut wait, how do I calculate recombination frequency? Maybe using the formula for expected plasmid density. If I denote p as the recombination frequency, then the expected plasmid count for each strain would depend on whether the mutations are linked. \n\nAlternatively, thinking about the ratio of plasmids. On the first half, the dilution is 1:1e7, and on the second, it's 1:1e5. The counts are 40 vs. 4. So, the first half has fewer plasmids per cell, implying more replication events due to recombination. Since recombination reduces the effective number of plasmids, the first half has higher replication efficiency. \n\nIf recombination occurred at a rate of r, then the expected number of plasmids would increase in the area where recombination happened. The difference in plasmid numbers between the two halves could indicate the presence of recombination. \n\nUsing the formula for the difference in plasmid densities between two parent strains, the recombination frequency can be calculated. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, if the first half (1e7) has a mean plasmid density of D, and the second (1e5) has D - d, then the difference d/(D + d/1e7) might give an estimate of recombination. \n\nBut maybe a simpler approach is to assume that the ratio of plasmids indicates the degree of recombination. For example, if the first half has twice as many plasmids as the second, that might suggest a high level of recombination. However, in this case, the first half has 40 plasmids and the second 4, which is a significant difference, suggesting high recombination. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the percentage of recombination. How do I convert that into a percentage? Maybe using the observed data to find the probability of recombination. If we consider that the majority of the plasmids came from recombination, the recombination frequency might be around 5% or less. \n\nLooking back at the options, J is 0.05%, and F is 0.3%. Given the significant difference in plasmid numbers, I think F (0.3%) is closer to what's expected. Alternatively, since the counts are 40 and 4, the ratio is 10 times higher, which might correspond to a recombination frequency of approximately 5%, which is option J. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the formula involves more precise calculation. \n\nAnother approach: if recombination occurs at a rate r, then the expected number of plasmids in the first half would be proportional to (1 - r), while in the second half, it would be proportional to (1 + r). Wait, actually, when recombination happens, the proportion of wildtype versus mutant increases. If r is the fraction of cells that recombine, then the mean plasmid density would change accordingly. \n\nGiven the observed plasmid counts, the ratio suggests that recombination happened significantly. Let me try calculating the recombination frequency using the formula for the difference in plasmid densities. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (P1 - P2)/(P1 + P2)\n\nWhere P1 is the mean plasmid density in the first half, and P2 in the second. But I think this is oversimplified. Instead, perhaps the correct formula considers the dilution factors. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the first half (1e7 dilution) has a mean plasmid density of 40, and the second (1e5) has 4. Assuming that the plasmid density decreases exponentially with dilution, the number of plasmids would decrease by a factor related to the dilution. \n\nIf I let x be the recombination frequency, then the expected plasmid density after dilution would be adjusted. Maybe using the formula:\n\nln(P1/P2) = ln((1 - x)/x) * ln(1e7 / 1e5)\n\nSimplifying, ln(40/4) = ln((1 - x)/x) * ln(100)\n\nln(10) \u2248 2.3026, so ln(100) \u2248 4.6052.\n\nSo,\n\nln(10) = ln((1 - x)/x) * 4.6052\n\nDivide both sides by 4.6052:\n\n0.6931 \u2248 ln((1 - x)/x)\n\nExponentiating both sides:\n\ne^(0.6931) \u2248 (1 - x)/x\n\nSince e^(0.6931) \u2248 2,\n\n2 \u2248 (1 - x)/x\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2x \u2248 1 - x\n\n3x \u2248 1\n\nx \u2248 1/3 \u2248 0.333...\n\nWhich is about 33.3%, but that's not among the options. Hmm, maybe my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the ratio of plasmids (40:4) corresponds to a recombination frequency of about 1/5, which is 20%, but that's not an option either. Wait, looking back, the answer choices don't go up to 20%, except for G (0.5%), H (0.5%), etc., but the closest is F (0.3%). \n\nMaybe a better approach is to use the fact that the difference in plasmid counts reflects the presence of recombination. The ratio of plasmids is 10:1, which suggests a high level of recombination. Using the formula for recombination frequency, the expected number of recombinants can be approximated by the ratio. \n\nIn diploid organisms, the expected number of recombinant offspring is roughly the square root of the ratio of parental to recombinant types. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Mean Plasmid Density of Recombinant Strain - Mean Plasmid Density of Parental Strain) / (Mean Plasmid Density of Recombinant Strain + Mean Plasmid Density of Parental Strain))\n\nIn our case, Mean Plasmid Density of Recombinant Strain (from the first half) is 40, Parental Strain (second half) is 4. So:\n\n(40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818, which is 81.8%, which doesn't make sense because recombination frequency cannot exceed 100%. I must have misapplied the formula. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Mean Plasmid Density of Recombinant Strain - Mean Plasmid Density of Parental Strain) / (Mean Plasmid Density of Parental Strain)\n\nWhich would be (40 - 4)/4 = 96/4 = 24, still over 100%. Not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to realize that the difference in plasmid counts gives an indication of the number of recombinant plasmids. Each recombination event creates a new plasmid. So, the total number of recombinant plasmids would be the sum of the extra plasmids in the first half compared to the second. \n\nFrom the first half: 40 plasmids\nSecond half: 4 plasmids\nDifference: 36 plasmids\n\nAssuming each recombination event adds a new plasmid, the recombination frequency would be 36 / (Total Plasmids).

Perhaps the actual relationship is linear, and the recombination frequency is directly proportional to the number of extra plasmids. \n\nThus, the recombination frequency would be 36 / 100 = 0.36, which is approximately 0.36%, corresponding to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

These are then tested separately against E. coli strain B and another strain K.\n\nSo, half the colonies are plated on strain B, and the other half on strain K. After dilution, there are 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. I remember that during these experiments, if you have two different mutation types, the number of recombinants depends on how often the two mutations occur together.\n\nWait, I think the key here is the concept of double stochasticity or reciprocal transduction. If two mutations cause independent events, the probability that both happen in the same cell is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if the lysogenic phage has a certain chance of causing issues and the lytic one doesn't, the combined effect would depend on both happening at the same time.\n\nIn the experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, only the E. coli from those phages die, leading to a higher ratio of lysis. When both types are present, half the colonies die (lytic), and the other half survive (lytic plus lysogenic). Then, these surviving colonies are tested against E. coli strain B and K.\n\nThe observed pluses are more on strain K than on B. Specifically, 40 on B and 4 on K. Since each positive colony represents a successful infection, the ratio suggests that strain K's phage had a higher chance of causing problems. This might indicate that the lysogenic phage (which usually is the one that works better) is less likely to cause issues, while the lytic phage (which doesn't work well) is more likely to do so.\n\nBut wait, the question is about recombination. Recombination would be if the two mutations are linked on the T_4 chromosome, meaning they affect nearby genes. If they're not recombined, their effects would act independently. In this case, since both types are present, we see that the presence of lysogenic affects some cells, and the lytic affects others.\n\nI think the number of recombinant colonies relates to the frequency of the combination of the two mutations. If both mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be lower compared to when they are linked.\n\nGiven that half the colonies were tested against B and the other half against K, and K had fewer pluses, perhaps the K phage's mutation leads to more recombinant cases. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage isn't as effective, so more of them cause issues when combined with the lytic ones.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose p is the probability that a cell has the lysogenic mutation, and q is the probability for the lytic mutation. Assuming independence, the probability that both mutations occur is pq. If the phages are not recombined, then the total number of recombinant colonies would be proportional to pq. However, if they are recombined, the effect could vary differently.\n\nLooking back at the data: 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. Since the entire population was split into two halves, the proportion of pluses should reflect the relative effectiveness of each mutation type. Maybe the lysogenic phage is less effective, so when it's combined with the lytic, it leads to fewer pluses? Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is more effective, so when it's present along with the lytic, it causes more pluses, but in reality, only the lysogenic does anything. Wait, no\u2014when both are present, only the lysogenic does damage. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother approach: The number of recombinant colonies is determined by how often both mutations occur in the same cell. If they are not recombined, the effect is additive; if they are, it's multiplicative. The ratio of pluses on K to B gives an idea of whether the lysogenic is more or less effective.\n\nSince there are 40 pluses on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10 times higher on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one causing issues) is less effective, so when it's combined with the lytic, it still causes issues in more cells, resulting in more pluses on K. Conversely, the lytic phage alone doesn't cause issues, so it wouldn't contribute much to the pluses when combined.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is low because the lysogenic phage is less effective, indicating that the two mutations are not tightly linked on the T_4 chromosome.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli is halved, which means some cells are dead and others are alive. These are then tested separately against E. coli strain B and another strain K.\n\nSo, half the colonies are plated on strain B, and the other half on strain K. After dilution, there are 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. I remember that during these experiments, if you have two different mutation types, the number of recombinants depends on how often the two mutations occur together.\n\nWait, I think the key here is the concept of double stochasticity or reciprocal transduction. If two mutations cause independent events, the probability that both happen in the same cell is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if the lysogenic phage has a certain chance of causing issues and the lytic one doesn't, the combined effect would depend on both happening at the same time.\n\nIn the experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, only the E. coli from those phages die, leading to a higher ratio of lysis. When both types are present, half the colonies die (lytic), and the other half survive (lytic plus lysogenic). Then, these surviving colonies are tested against E. coli strain B and K.\n\nThe observed pluses are more on strain K than on B. Specifically, 40 on B and 4 on K. Since each positive colony represents a successful infection, the ratio suggests that strain K's phage had a higher chance of causing problems. This might indicate that the lysogenic phage (which usually is the one that works better) is less likely to cause issues, while the lytic phage (which doesn't work well) is more likely to do so.\n\nBut wait, the question is about recombination. Recombination would be if the two mutations are linked on the T_4 chromosome, meaning they affect nearby genes. If they're not recombined, their effects would act independently. In this case, since both types are present, we see that the presence of lysogenic affects some cells, and the lytic affects others.\n\nI think the number of recombinant colonies relates to the frequency of the combination of the two mutations. If both mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be lower compared to when they are linked.\n\nGiven that half the colonies were tested against B and the other half against K, and K had fewer pluses, perhaps the K phage's mutation leads to more recombinant cases. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage isn't as effective, so more of them cause issues when combined with the lytic ones.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose p is the probability that a cell has the lysogenic mutation, and q is the probability for the lytic mutation. Assuming independence, the probability that both mutations occur is pq. If the phages are not recombined, then the total number of recombinant colonies would be proportional to pq. However, if they are recombined, the effect could vary differently.\n\nLooking back at the data: 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. Since the entire population was split into two halves, the proportion of pluses should reflect the relative effectiveness of each mutation type. Maybe the lysogenic phage is less effective, so when it's combined with the lytic, it leads to fewer pluses? Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is more effective, so when it's present along with the lytic, it causes more pluses, but in reality, only the lysogenic does anything. Wait, no\u2014when both are present, only the lysogenic does damage. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother approach: The number of recombinant colonies is determined by how often both mutations occur in the same cell. If they are not recombined, the effect is additive; if they are, it's multiplicative. The ratio of pluses on K to B gives an idea of whether the lysogenic is more or less effective.\n\nSince there are 40 pluses on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10 times higher on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one causing issues) is less effective, so when it's combined with the lytic, it still causes issues in more cells, resulting in more pluses on K. Conversely, the lytic phage alone doesn't cause issues, so it wouldn't contribute much to the pluses when combined.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is low because the lysogenic phage is less effective, indicating that the two mutations are not tightly linked on the T_4 chromosome.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The results show four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. So if there's a recombination event, the phages would produce different variants. If there's no recombination, their variants are similar. In this case, the lysogenic phage from the type that works should be compatible with either the B or K phage. Wait, no\u2014maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it incompatible with the K phage, leading some to lyse B while others don't. Or maybe the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause issues when it replicates within the host.\n\nWait, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, half the bacteria die. That suggests that both types of phages affect the same target. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B (it lyses), but when mixed with the B phage mutant, which is lysogenic as well, perhaps there's a point where the phages can replicate without causing issues, allowing them to replicate on the lysogenic phage of another strain. \n\nThe key here is that the number of plasmid copies determines whether the phage can integrate. If there's a recombination event, the lysogenic phage might have a different origin than the lysogenic phage in the B strain. Alternatively, since the lysogenic phage in the B strain causes death, any recombination would make the lysogenic phage incompatible with the B phage.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage in B is responsible for the death. So when the lysogenic phage from the other type (which doesn't work) is mixed with the B phage, the B phage may replicate without issues, allowing the lysogenic phage from the other type to lyse the cells. But how does recombination factor into this?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a recombination event allows for the lysogenic phage to replicate without inducing lysis, thereby reducing the number of plasmids available, making it harder for the lysogenic phage in the other type to replicate successfully. This could explain why half the bacteria died\u2014since the lysogenic phage from the other type couldn't replicate effectively, the cells didn't lyse.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. How do we determine that? Maybe looking at the number of plasmids detected. Each bacterium has a certain number of phage DNA copies. If there's a recombination event, the lysogenic phage might have a different origin than the lysogenic phage in the B strain. However, in the experiment, when both types are present, the B strain's lysogenic phage (which is bad) might replicate without issues, leading to less plasmids per cell, thus fewer deaths.\n\nIf there were no recombination, the lysogenic phage from the other type would replicate normally, allowing the B phage to replicate without issues, resulting in all plasmids being replicated, leading to higher death rates, possibly more than 40 plasmids. But here, only 40 are found, suggesting that each cell had approximately 40 plasmids. If recombination occurred, then the lysogenic phage from the other type wouldn't replicate efficiently, leading to lower plasmid counts per cell, hence fewer deaths.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency (or map units) is:\n\nmap units = 1 - (number of recombinant chromosomes)\n\nBut in this context, the number of plasmids detected can help estimate the likelihood. The expected number of plasmids per cell under normal circumstances (no recombination) would be high, say around 50-60. Here, it's around 40, which is lower. The difference indicates that there was some recombination. Specifically, the ratio of the observed plasmids to the expected plasmids gives an idea of the fraction of cells with recombined chromosomes.\n\nSo if the expectation is 50 plasmids and we observe 40, the ratio is 40/50 = 0.8, meaning that 80% of the cells have recombination. To convert this to percentage, multiply by 100: 80%. But none of the options go up to 80%, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids per cell relates to the number of regions of integration, which is inversely proportional to the map unit.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:\n\nm = 1 - (plasmid count / expected plasmid count)\n\nAssuming expected is 50, m = 1 - (40/50) = 0.2, so 20%. But again, this isn't among the choices except F.0.3 percent. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Instead, the number of plasmids detected corresponds directly to the map unit. For example, if the expected is 50 plasmids, and you detect 40, the map unit would be (50 - 40)/50 * 100 = 20%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the map unit could be calculated differently. Perhaps using the formula:\n\nm = (observed plasmids / expected plasmids) * 100\n\nBut if the expected is 50 and observed is 40, that's 80%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m = (expected - observed)/expected * 100, which would be (50-40)/50*100=20%, still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the actual calculation uses the number of plasmids per cell. Suppose that in the absence of recombination, each cell would have 50 plasmids, and some would have 40 due to recombination. Then, the recombination rate would be (50 - 40)/50 * 100 = 20%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is m = (recombination + non-recombinant)/total, but without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the number of plasmids detected in the two plates is 40 on K and 40 on B. Wait, no\u2014it says \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the K plate is 40 plasmids, and the B plate is also 40 plasmids. Hmm, but I thought earlier that in the absence of recombination, each cell would have more plasmids, like 50. If the observed is 40, then the difference is 10, which could suggest that 10% of the cells have recombination. But again, the options don't include 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plasmids detected reflects the degree of recombination. Each time there's a recombination, the number of plasmids decreases. If the expected number under no recombination is X, and the observed is Y, then the recombination rate is (X - Y)/X * 100. For example, if X is 50 and Y is 40, (50-40)/50=0.2=20%.\n\nBut the options provided don't include 20%. The closest is option B, 2 percent. Hmm, maybe my assumptions are off. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be m = (Y/X)*100, so 40/50=0.8=80%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results. The result is that half the bacteria died when plated on strain B, showing 40 plasmids. When plated on strain K, the other half died, showing 40 plasmids as well. But according to the experiment, the total number of plasmids in the two plates combined is 80, but each plate has 40. So each plate represents half the original population.\n\nWait, let me clarify: when both mutant phages are present, half the bacteria die. That means each half has 40 plasmids. When these are plated on strain B, 40 plasmids lead to 40 cells with 0 plasmids (due to recombination?), while the remaining 40 cells have plasmids. Similarly, when plated on strain K, the same logic applies. But I'm getting confused now.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the number of times a recombination occurs. If each bacterium has a certain number of plasmids, and some undergo recombination, the number reduces. If the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of plasmids per cell would be P = P0*(1 - R/100), where P0 is the number without recombination. From the data, if P0 is 50, and observed is 40, then 40=50*(1 - R/100) \u2192 0.8=1-R/100 \u2192 R/100=0.2 \u2192 R=20%.\n\nAgain, 20% isn't an option, but perhaps the actual calculation is different. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 0.2 percent, which is option E, because when recombination occurs, the chance that a phage integrates into the host is reduced. So the probability of recombination is low, leading to fewer plasmids. If the recombination frequency is 0.2 percent, then the expected number of plasmids per cell would be close to the base value. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plasmids detected can be used to estimate the map unit. The formula is:\n\nm = (plasmids detected / expected plasmids) * 100\n\nHere, plasmids detected are 40, expected is 50, so m=(40/50)*100=80%. But again, this isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is m = (expected - detected)/expected *100, which would be 10%, but that's also not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in reality, the number of plasmids detected is related to the map unit. For example, if the recombination is at a certain distance, the map unit is determined by the number of regions of integration. So if the recombination is at 10%, the map unit is 10%, corresponding to 100 plasmids lost. Thus, the expected plasmids per cell would be 50 - 10=40, leading to a recombination rate of 10%. But 10% isn't an option either.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the highest is G.5 percent. So perhaps the correct answer is C.1.5 percent. Because if the recombination is at 1.5 percent, then the expected plasmids per cell would be 50 - 1.5=48.5, but the observed is 40, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to realize that the number of plasmids detected (40) is a result of the loss of recombination. So the recombination rate is (base plasmids - observed)/base plasmids. If base is 50, then (50-40)/50=0.2=20%. Still not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids detected corresponds to the map unit. So if the observed plasmids are 40, and the expected is 50, the recombination frequency is (50-40)/50=0.2=20%. But since 20% isn't an option, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is 2 percent. So the map unit is 2%, leading to a decrease in plasmids. For example, if the expected is 50, the observed would be 50*(1 - 2%)=49. But the observed is 40, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look at the options and see which one fits best. Option D is 0.1%, which is very low, implying almost no recombination. Option C is 1.5%, which is moderate. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer to 0.1%. But my calculations keep pointing towards 20%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the experiment. It says that when both mutant phages are present, half the bacteria die. So each half has 40 plasmids. When plated on strain B, 40 plasmids mean 40 cells have 0 plasmids (due to recombination), and 40 have normal plasmids. When plated on strain K, the same happens. But how does this relate to the recombination frequency?\n\nAh! The key is that recombination leads to a reduction in the number of plasmids. So the proportion of cells with recombinant plasmids is determined by the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of cells with recombinant plasmids is r * N. If N is the total number of cells, then the number of cells with recombinant plasmids is r*N.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, half the bacteria die. Assuming that the death occurs when the lysogenic phage cannot replicate, which requires the phage to integrate into the host's genome. If there's recombination, this integration is impaired, leading to fewer plasmids and thus fewer cells dying.\n\nSo the number of dead cells is proportional to the number of recombinant plasmids. Given that half the cells die, and assuming each cell has a certain number of plasmids, the recombination frequency must account for this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Total cells after mixing: N\n- Dead cells: N/2\n- Recombinant plasmids per cell: R\n\nAssuming each cell has the same number of plasmids, say M, then the total number of plasmids is N*M.\n\nAfter recombination, some cells lose R plasmids. So the number of plasmids per recombinant cell is M - R.\n\nThe total plasmids in the mixture would remain the same, so:\n\n(N - R) * (M - R) = N*M\n\nExpanding:\n\nN*M - R*M - R*M + R\u00b2 = N*M\n\nSimplifying:\n\n-2R*M + R\u00b2 = 0\n\nWhich implies R( -2M + R ) = 0\n\nSince R \u2260 0,\n\n-2M + R = 0 \u2192 R = 2M\n\nThis suggests that the recombination loss is twice the number of plasmids per cell. But I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the expected vs observed plasmids. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids per cell decreases. The expected plasmids per cell would be M, and the observed would be M - R. If the observed is 40, and M is 50, then R = 10.\n\nThus, recombination loss is 10 plasmids per cell. The recombination frequency is R/M = 10/50 = 0.2 = 20%.\n\nBut again, 20% isn't an option. Looking back at the options, the closest is G.5 percent. But 20% is much larger than any given option except perhaps E.0.2 percent. Wait, E is 0.2%, which is 0.002 in decimal. My calculation gave 20%, which is nowhere near E.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the experiment. Maybe the death rate is due to the loss of recombination, so the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells that lost recombination. If 50% of the cells died, that could indicate a significant recombination. But 50% death rate with 40 plasmids seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to compare the expected and observed plasmids. Expected plasmids per cell: 50. Observed:40. Difference:10. So the recombination rate is 10/50=0.2=20%. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the recombination rate is such that each cell loses the same number of plasmids, and the observed number is 40 out of 50. Therefore, the recombination occurs in 10% of cells, leading to a recombination frequency of 10%. But 10% isn't an option either.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is B.2 percent, even though my calculations suggest otherwise.

From the data, if P0 is 50, and observed is 40, then 40=50*(1 - R/100) \u2192 0.8=1-R/100 \u2192 R/100=0.2 \u2192 R=20%.\n\nAgain, 20% isn't an option, but perhaps the actual calculation is different. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 0.2 percent, which is option E, because when recombination occurs, the chance that a phage integrates into the host is reduced. So the probability of recombination is low, leading to fewer plasmids. If the recombination frequency is 0.2 percent, then the expected number of plasmids per cell would be close to the base value. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plasmids detected can be used to estimate the map unit. The formula is:\n\nm = (plasmids detected / expected plasmids) * 100\n\nHere, plasmids detected are 40, expected is 50, so m=(40/50)*100=80%. But again, this isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is m = (expected - detected)/expected *100, which would be 10%, but that's also not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in reality, the number of plasmids detected is related to the map unit. For example, if the recombination is at a certain distance, the map unit is determined by the number of regions of integration. So if the recombination is at 10%, the map unit is 10%, corresponding to 100 plasmids lost. Thus, the expected plasmids per cell would be 50 - 10=40, leading to a recombination rate of 10%. But 10% isn't an option either.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the highest is G.5 percent. So perhaps the correct answer is C.1.5 percent. Because if the recombination is at 1.5 percent, then the expected plasmids per cell would be 50 - 1.5=48.5, but the observed is 40, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to realize that the number of plasmids detected (40) is a result of the loss of recombination. So the recombination rate is (base plasmids - observed)/base plasmids. If base is 50, then (50-40)/50=0.2=20%. Still not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids detected corresponds to the map unit. So if the observed plasmids are 40, and the expected is 50, the recombination frequency is (50-40)/50=0.2=20%. But since 20% isn't an option, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is 2 percent. So the map unit is 2%, leading to a decrease in plasmids. For example, if the expected is 50, the observed would be 50*(1 - 2%)=49. But the observed is 40, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look at the options and see which one fits best. Option D is 0.1%, which is very low, implying almost no recombination. Option C is 1.5%, which is moderate. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer to 0.1%. But my calculations keep pointing towards 20%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the experiment. It says that when both mutant phages are present, half the bacteria die. So each half has 40 plasmids. When plated on strain B, 40 plasmids mean 40 cells have 0 plasmids (due to recombination), and 40 have normal plasmids. When plated on strain K, the same happens. But how does this relate to the recombination frequency?\n\nAh! The key is that recombination leads to a reduction in the number of plasmids. So the proportion of cells with recombinant plasmids is determined by the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of cells with recombinant plasmids is r * N. If N is the total number of cells, then the number of cells with recombinant plasmids is r*N.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, half the bacteria die. Assuming that the death occurs when the lysogenic phage cannot replicate, which requires the phage to integrate into the host's genome. If there's recombination, this integration is impaired, leading to fewer plasmids and thus fewer cells dying.\n\nSo the number of dead cells is proportional to the number of recombinant plasmids. Given that half the cells die, and assuming each cell has a certain number of plasmids, the recombination frequency must account for this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Total cells after mixing: N\n- Dead cells: N/2\n- Recombinant plasmids per cell: R\n\nAssuming each cell has the same number of plasmids, say M, then the total number of plasmids is N*M.\n\nAfter recombination, some cells lose R plasmids. So the number of plasmids per recombinant cell is M - R.\n\nThe total plasmids in the mixture would remain the same, so:\n\n(N - R) * (M - R) = N*M\n\nExpanding:\n\nN*M - R*M - R*M + R\u00b2 = N*M\n\nSimplifying:\n\n-2R*M + R\u00b2 = 0\n\nWhich implies R( -2M + R ) = 0\n\nSince R \u2260 0,\n\n-2M + R = 0 \u2192 R = 2M\n\nThis suggests that the recombination loss is twice the number of plasmids per cell. But I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the expected vs observed plasmids. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids per cell decreases. The expected plasmids per cell would be M, and the observed would be M - R. If the observed is 40, and M is 50, then R = 10.\n\nThus, recombination loss is 10 plasmids per cell. The recombination frequency is R/M = 10/50 = 0.2 = 20%.\n\nBut again, 20% isn't an option. Looking back at the options, the closest is G.5 percent. But 20% is much larger than any given option except perhaps E.0.2 percent. Wait, E is 0.2%, which is 0.002 in decimal. My calculation gave 20%, which is nowhere near E.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the experiment. Maybe the death rate is due to the loss of recombination, so the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells that lost recombination. If 50% of the cells died, that could indicate a significant recombination. But 50% death rate with 40 plasmids seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to compare the expected and observed plasmids. Expected plasmids per cell: 50. Observed:40. Difference:10. So the recombination rate is 10/50=0.2=20%. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the recombination rate is such that each cell loses the same number of plasmids, and the observed number is 40 out of 50. Therefore, the recombination occurs in 10% of cells, leading to a recombination frequency of 10%. But 10% isn't an option either.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is B.2 percent, even though my calculations suggest otherwise. Perhaps I missed something in the problem setup.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

These are then tested against two different bacterial strains, B and K.\n\nThe key experiment here is the dilution assay. After incubation, there's a certain number of plasmid copies in each sample. They've run this twice\u2014once with a higher dilution (1:10^7) and once with a lower (1:10^5), and then plated them onto different bacterial strains. The results show more plasmids in the K culture (40 plumes) compared to B (4 plumes).\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have mixed up which culture was where. Let me clarify: half the population was treated with a high-dilution (1:10^7) phage plates, and the other half was low-dilution (1:10^5) plates. Then these were plated on E. coli strain B for K and E. coli strain K for B.\n\nSo, in the K culture, there are 40 plumes (plasmid copies per well), and in B culture, 4 plumes. Since the initial sample was split into two equal parts, if we assume each part had an average of 20 plumes each before being plated, then the total would be 40 and 8? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nThe important thing is that when you plate on a strain that has the mutation, you expect a certain number of plumes. If the mutation causes the phage to replicate (lytic), the cells will lyse, producing plumes. Conversely, if it causes lysis (lysogenic), the cells won't lyse as much, or the phage will integrate into the host genome.\n\nIn the first case, with only lysogenic phages (from E. coli strain B), they cause the lytic strain B to die. So the survivors (which must be E. coli strain K) would be positive for the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, if only the lytic phages were present, the lysogenic strain wouldn't grow, but since both are present, the lysogenic one would survive.\n\nBut wait, the initial experiment shows that both mutations can occur. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the expected numbers under different scenarios.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, the lysogenic phage would lyse E. coli B, and the lytic phage would integrate into K. But in reality, only one type is active at any time. However, during replication, some may replicate and others lyse. This leads to a phenomenon called \"double-reciprocal inhibition,\" where both mutations require specific conditions.\n\nWhen you plate on a strain without either mutation, you'd see fewer plumes than normal. Here, the high-dilution group (1:10^7) probably has the lysogenic phage, while the low-dilution (1:10^5) has the lytic phage. Because when you plate on strain K, you get 4 plumes, which suggests that the lysogenic mutation is present because the phage integrates into K. On strain B, you get 40 plumes, meaning the phage is replicating in B but not in K because it's lytic.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again. When you plate on strain B, you're testing for the lysogenic mutation. If the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't replicate in B because E. coli doesn't integrate those genes. Instead, it would lyse B. So why do you see 40 plumes?\n\nAh, maybe I got it wrong. Actually, when you plate on strain B, the presence of plumes indicates that the lysogenic phage is replicating because E. coli hasn't integrated it yet. So if the lysogenic phage is present, it should lyse B. Therefore, the number of plumes in B should be zero, but instead, it's showing 40. That doesn't add up. Maybe I need to consider the initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the high-dilution (1:10^7) represents the lysogenic phage because it's integrating into E. coli B, causing a lytic cycle. The low-dilution (1:10^5) represents the lytic phage, which integrates into E. coli K, causing a lysogenic cycle.\n\nNow, when you plate on K (the original source), you should see plumes from the lysogenic phage, because the phage didn't lyse K. When you plate on B, you should see plumes from the lysogenic phage, but since B doesn't integrate it, it's replicating and causing a lytic event, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, that still doesn't fit. Let me think differently. The high-dilution (1:10^7) is likely the lysogenic phage because it's integrating into E. coli B, causing it to lyse. The low-dilution (1:10^5) is the lytic phage, which integrates into E. coli K, causing it to lyse normally.\n\nThen, when you plate on K, you expect plumes from the lysogenic phage, because the phage didn't lyse K. When you plate on B, you expect plumes from the lysogenic phage because the phage didn't lyse B. But according to the results, you have 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. That seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the high-dilution is the lysogenic, and low-dilution is the lytic. So:\n\n- High-dilution (1:10^7): Lysogenic phage \u2192 Integrates into B \u2192 Lyse \u2192 Plume. So each plume indicates integration.\n- Low-dilution (1:10^5): Lytic phage \u2192 Integrates into K \u2192 Doesn't lyse \u2192 No plume because phage isn't replicating.\n\nBut in the experiment, when you plate on K, you get 4 plumes, implying that the lysogenic phage is replicating, but that contradicts the expectation that it's already integrated.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused about the role of the phage in each culture. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Two types of mutantphages: M1 (lytic) and M2 (lysogenic).\n2. Both are present in the same sample.\n3. Infected E. coli strain B and K.\n4. After incubation, plasmid copy numbers are measured in each subpopulation.\n\nWhen you plate on E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage (M2) is present, so you should see plumes indicating that M2 is replicating because the phage is integrating into B. However, the result shows 4 plumes, suggesting that M2 is replicating in B. On the other hand, when you plate on E. coli strain K, the lysogenic phage is present, so you should see plumes indicating its activity. But instead, you see 40 plumes, which is much higher. That doesn't make sense unless the lysogenic phage is replicating in K, but that shouldn't happen because E. coli doesn't integrate lysogenic genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of the phage in each culture. Let me think again. When you plate on K, you expect plumes from the lysogenic phage because it hasn't been integrated yet. But the result is 40 plumes, which is way higher. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating in K, which shouldn't be possible. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is replicating in B but not in K. But how?\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps I should recall the concept of double-reciprocal inhibition. In this scenario, the presence of both lysogenic and lytic phages inhibits each other. Normally, when neither is present, the maximum number of plumes is achieved. When either is present, plumes decrease.\n\nBut in this experiment, when you plate on K, which expects plumes from lysogenic phage, you don't see any; instead, you see 40 plumes, which implies that the lysogenic phage is replicating in K. That's impossible because K lacks the lysogenic gene. Unless the lysogenic phage is replicating in E. coli K due to some other reason, like multiple generations within the same cell.\n\nWait, that makes sense! If the lysogenic phage is present in sufficient quantity within the same cell, it can replicate itself, even though the cell doesn't integrate the lysogenic gene. So when you plate on K, which doesn't have the lysogenic gene, you see many plumes because the lysogenic phage is replicating inside cells of K. Similarly, when you plate on B, which lacks the lysogenic gene, you see plumes from the lytic phage, which integrates into B and causes it to lyse.\n\nThat explains the results: on K, you have 40 plumes (lysogenic phage replicating), and on B, you have 4 plumes (lytic phage replicating). Now, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the interaction between different types of mutations within the same phage.\n\nIn the context of the T_4 genome, the two types of mutations are mutually exclusive because a phage cannot be both lysogenic and lytic at the same time. However, the experiment measures their frequencies separately. The recombination rate would indicate how often the two mutations interact within the same cell.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of lysogenic phage and q is the frequency of lytic phage. However, since both are present, we need to account for their interaction.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n- In the high-dilution (1:10^7) culture, which presumably contains lysogenic phage, we observe 40 plumes. Assuming each plume corresponds to one lysogenic phage copy, the total lysogenic phage in that culture is 40. However, the actual lysogenic phage should be less because some are replicating.\n- In the low-dilution (1:10^5) culture, which contains lytic phage, we observe 4 plumes. Each plume corresponds to one lytic phage. The actual lytic phage should be less because some are replicating.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage in the high-dilution culture has a certain number, say L, and the lytic phage has Y, we can relate them through the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote r as the recombination frequency. Each lysogenic phage can potentially integrate with a lytic phage at a fraction r. So, the total lysogenic phage in high-dilution would be L = (number of plumes) * (probability of integration). Similarly, the total lytic phage in low-dilution would be Y = (number of plumes) / (1 - r), assuming that the lytic phage integrates at a rate (1 - r) relative to the lysogenic.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Instead, let's think about the relationship between the plumes observed in each culture. The high-dilution culture (lysogenic) should produce plumes proportional to the number of lysogenic phages, minus those that are replicating. Similarly, the low-dilution culture (lytic) should produce plumes proportional to the number of lytic phages, minus those that are replicating.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- L = total lysogenic phage in high-dilution\n- Y = total lytic phage in low-dilution\n\nWe know that in high-dilution, each plume corresponds to one lysogenic phage. However, since some lysogenic phages are replicating, the actual number of new lysogenic phages introduced is L * (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. So, L = Y + L * (1 - r).\n\nSimilarly, in low-dilution, each plume corresponds to one lytic phage. Some lytic phages replicate, so the actual number is Y * (1 - r). So, the number of plumes is proportional to Y * (1 - r).\n\nPutting it together:\nL = Y + L * (1 - r)\nY * (1 - r) = P_plumes_low_dilution\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Another way is to consider that the recombination frequency affects the distribution of plasmids between the two cultures.\n\nGiven that we have plumes in both cultures, the expected number of plumes in each depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\nNumber of plumes = F * N, where F is the frequency and N is the number of cells.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Let me simplify.\n\nSince we have 40 plumes in the high-dilution and 4 in the low-dilution, and knowing that each plume represents a replication event, we can estimate the frequencies.\n\nIn the high-dilution (lysogenic):\nTotal lysogenic phage = 40 / (1 - r)\n\nIn the low-dilution (lytic):\nTotal lytic phage = 4 / (1 - r)\n\nBut also, the actual number of lysogenic phages should be greater than the lytic ones, since each lysogenic phage can integrate with a lytic one at a frequency r.\n\nSo, 40 / (1 - r) > 4 / (1 - r)\n\nWhich simplifies to 40 > 4, which is true regardless of r. But we need to find r such that the plumes correspond correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes in the two cultures should reflect the product of their respective frequencies adjusted by the recombination probability.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = frequency of lysogenic phage\n- q = frequency of lytic phage\n- r = recombination frequency\n\nFrom the high-dilution culture:\nTotal lysogenic = 40 = p / (1 - r)\n\nFrom the low-dilution culture:\nTotal lytic = 4 = q / (1 - r)\n\nBut lysogenic and lytic phages are mutually exclusive, except for recombinant forms. Wait, no, the T_4 phage can't be both lysogenic and lytic. So, the actual frequencies would be:\n\nTotal phages = lysogenic + lytic + recombinant\n\nBut this complicates things. Alternatively, considering that in a normal situation without recombination, lysogenic and lytic phages would coexist without interfering. With recombination, some phages would integrate with lysogenic ones, reducing the number of free phages.\n\nHowever, in our experiment, we have separate counts for lysogenic and lytic plumes, which suggests that the phages are acting independently in each culture, which isn't realistic because they share the same cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct model is that the lysogenic phage can integrate with the lytic phage at a rate r, affecting both their frequencies.\n\nThus, the observed lysogenic plumes include those that successfully integrated (Y * (1 - r)) plus those that replicated (L * r), where L is the number of new lysogenic phages. But this gets complex.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the total number of plumes in each culture is proportional to the square root of the product of their frequencies. According to the square root rule, the number of plumes is approximately the square root of the number of cells times the square root of the product of their frequencies.\n\nSo, sqrt(L * Y) \u2248 number of plumes.\n\nApplying this approximation:\n\nFor the high-dilution (lysogenic culture):\nsqrt(40 * Y) \u2248 ?\n\nFor the low-dilution (lytic culture):\nsqrt(Y * 4) \u2248 ?\n\nBut this is speculative. Without precise calculations, it's challenging to determine r accurately.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to note that the recombination frequency is the proportion of times the two mutations interact. Given the results, we have 40 plumes in one culture and 4 in another. The difference suggests that most of the lysogenic phage is interacting with the lytic phage, hence the recombination frequency is high.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest is D (0.02%) and E (0.05%). Given that the results suggest significant interaction, E (0.05%) might be plausible, but it's very low. Alternatively, since the lysogenic phage is in high-dilution and lytic in low-dilution, the recombination could be around 2% or 5%.\n\nWait, another thought: the square root rule says that the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(frequency1 * frequency2). So, if in the high-dilution, we have 40 plumes, and in the low-dilution, 4 plumes, then:\n\nsqrt(40 * Y) \u2248 number of plumes in high-dilution\nsqrt(Y * 4) \u2248 number of plumes in low-dilution\n\nBut this leads to:\n\nsqrt(40 * Y) = X\nsqrt(Y * 4) = Y'\n\nBut without exact values, it's hard to solve for Y. Alternatively, taking the ratio:\n\nX / Y' = sqrt((40 * Y) / (Y * 4)) )= sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16\n\nBut since X is 40 and Y' is 4, 40/4 =10, which matches sqrt(10)^2=10.\n\nThis suggests that the frequencies are inversely related. Therefore, the product of their frequencies is consistent with the data.\n\nBut this still doesn't help us find r directly. Maybe we need to consider that the recombination frequency affects the expected plume count.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the concept of double-reciprocal inhibition. The maximum number of plumes is when neither mutation is present. As either mutation increases, the number decreases.\n\nThe recombination frequency determines the degree of inhibition. A higher recombination frequency reduces the effect of both mutations.\n\nGiven that the experiment shows a significant interaction, the recombination frequency is likely high. Among the options, E (0.05%) and D (0.02%) are low, while C (1.5%) and G (0.5%) are moderate and high respectively.\n\nConsidering that the results are quite pronounced (40 vs 4), the recombination frequency is likely around 2%. So option B (2%) is a possibility.\n\nBut wait, 0.05% is even lower. Given that 40 plumes in high-dilution and 4 in low-dilution, the interaction is substantial, so the recombination frequency is probably around 5%, making E the answer.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because the square root rule suggested a relation between the products, but without solving for r, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, given the results, the most probable answer is E",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two halves: one is lysed, another survives. These are then tested against two different bacterial strains, B and K.\n\nThe key experiment here is the dilution assay. After incubation, there's a certain number of plasmid copies in each sample. They've run this twice\u2014once with a higher dilution (1:10^7) and once with a lower (1:10^5), and then plated them onto different bacterial strains. The results show more plasmids in the K culture (40 plumes) compared to B (4 plumes).\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have mixed up which culture was where. Let me clarify: half the population was treated with a high-dilution (1:10^7) phage plates, and the other half was low-dilution (1:10^5) plates. Then these were plated on E. coli strain B for K and E. coli strain K for B.\n\nSo, in the K culture, there are 40 plumes (plasmid copies per well), and in B culture, 4 plumes. Since the initial sample was split into two equal parts, if we assume each part had an average of 20 plumes each before being plated, then the total would be 40 and 8? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nThe important thing is that when you plate on a strain that has the mutation, you expect a certain number of plumes. If the mutation causes the phage to replicate (lytic), the cells will lyse, producing plumes. Conversely, if it causes lysis (lysogenic), the cells won't lyse as much, or the phage will integrate into the host genome.\n\nIn the first case, with only lysogenic phages (from E. coli strain B), they cause the lytic strain B to die. So the survivors (which must be E. coli strain K) would be positive for the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, if only the lytic phages were present, the lysogenic strain wouldn't grow, but since both are present, the lysogenic one would survive.\n\nBut wait, the initial experiment shows that both mutations can occur. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the expected numbers under different scenarios.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, the lysogenic phage would lyse E. coli B, and the lytic phage would integrate into K. But in reality, only one type is active at any time. However, during replication, some may replicate and others lyse. This leads to a phenomenon called \"double-reciprocal inhibition,\" where both mutations require specific conditions.\n\nWhen you plate on a strain without either mutation, you'd see fewer plumes than normal. Here, the high-dilution group (1:10^7) probably has the lysogenic phage, while the low-dilution (1:10^5) has the lytic phage. Because when you plate on strain K, you get 4 plumes, which suggests that the lysogenic mutation is present because the phage integrates into K. On strain B, you get 40 plumes, meaning the phage is replicating in B but not in K because it's lytic.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again. When you plate on strain B, you're testing for the lysogenic mutation. If the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't replicate in B because E. coli doesn't integrate those genes. Instead, it would lyse B. So why do you see 40 plumes?\n\nAh, maybe I got it wrong. Actually, when you plate on strain B, the presence of plumes indicates that the lysogenic phage is replicating because E. coli hasn't integrated it yet. So if the lysogenic phage is present, it should lyse B. Therefore, the number of plumes in B should be zero, but instead, it's showing 40. That doesn't add up. Maybe I need to consider the initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the high-dilution (1:10^7) represents the lysogenic phage because it's integrating into E. coli B, causing a lytic cycle. The low-dilution (1:10^5) represents the lytic phage, which integrates into E. coli K, causing a lysogenic cycle.\n\nNow, when you plate on K (the original source), you should see plumes from the lysogenic phage, because the phage didn't lyse K. When you plate on B, you should see plumes from the lysogenic phage, but since B doesn't integrate it, it's replicating and causing a lytic event, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, that still doesn't fit. Let me think differently. The high-dilution (1:10^7) is likely the lysogenic phage because it's integrating into E. coli B, causing it to lyse. The low-dilution (1:10^5) is the lytic phage, which integrates into E. coli K, causing it to lyse normally.\n\nThen, when you plate on K, you expect plumes from the lysogenic phage, because the phage didn't lyse K. When you plate on B, you expect plumes from the lysogenic phage because the phage didn't lyse B. But according to the results, you have 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. That seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the high-dilution is the lysogenic, and low-dilution is the lytic. So:\n\n- High-dilution (1:10^7): Lysogenic phage \u2192 Integrates into B \u2192 Lyse \u2192 Plume. So each plume indicates integration.\n- Low-dilution (1:10^5): Lytic phage \u2192 Integrates into K \u2192 Doesn't lyse \u2192 No plume because phage isn't replicating.\n\nBut in the experiment, when you plate on K, you get 4 plumes, implying that the lysogenic phage is replicating, but that contradicts the expectation that it's already integrated.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused about the role of the phage in each culture. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Two types of mutantphages: M1 (lytic) and M2 (lysogenic).\n2. Both are present in the same sample.\n3. Infected E. coli strain B and K.\n4. After incubation, plasmid copy numbers are measured in each subpopulation.\n\nWhen you plate on E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage (M2) is present, so you should see plumes indicating that M2 is replicating because the phage is integrating into B. However, the result shows 4 plumes, suggesting that M2 is replicating in B. On the other hand, when you plate on E. coli strain K, the lysogenic phage is present, so you should see plumes indicating its activity. But instead, you see 40 plumes, which is much higher. That doesn't make sense unless the lysogenic phage is replicating in K, but that shouldn't happen because E. coli doesn't integrate lysogenic genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of the phage in each culture. Let me think again. When you plate on K, you expect plumes from the lysogenic phage because it hasn't been integrated yet. But the result is 40 plumes, which is way higher. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating in K, which shouldn't be possible. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is replicating in B but not in K. But how?\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps I should recall the concept of double-reciprocal inhibition. In this scenario, the presence of both lysogenic and lytic phages inhibits each other. Normally, when neither is present, the maximum number of plumes is achieved. When either is present, plumes decrease.\n\nBut in this experiment, when you plate on K, which expects plumes from lysogenic phage, you don't see any; instead, you see 40 plumes, which implies that the lysogenic phage is replicating in K. That's impossible because K lacks the lysogenic gene. Unless the lysogenic phage is replicating in E. coli K due to some other reason, like multiple generations within the same cell.\n\nWait, that makes sense! If the lysogenic phage is present in sufficient quantity within the same cell, it can replicate itself, even though the cell doesn't integrate the lysogenic gene. So when you plate on K, which doesn't have the lysogenic gene, you see many plumes because the lysogenic phage is replicating inside cells of K. Similarly, when you plate on B, which lacks the lysogenic gene, you see plumes from the lytic phage, which integrates into B and causes it to lyse.\n\nThat explains the results: on K, you have 40 plumes (lysogenic phage replicating), and on B, you have 4 plumes (lytic phage replicating). Now, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the interaction between different types of mutations within the same phage.\n\nIn the context of the T_4 genome, the two types of mutations are mutually exclusive because a phage cannot be both lysogenic and lytic at the same time. However, the experiment measures their frequencies separately. The recombination rate would indicate how often the two mutations interact within the same cell.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of lysogenic phage and q is the frequency of lytic phage. However, since both are present, we need to account for their interaction.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n- In the high-dilution (1:10^7) culture, which presumably contains lysogenic phage, we observe 40 plumes. Assuming each plume corresponds to one lysogenic phage copy, the total lysogenic phage in that culture is 40. However, the actual lysogenic phage should be less because some are replicating.\n- In the low-dilution (1:10^5) culture, which contains lytic phage, we observe 4 plumes. Each plume corresponds to one lytic phage. The actual lytic phage should be less because some are replicating.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage in the high-dilution culture has a certain number, say L, and the lytic phage has Y, we can relate them through the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote r as the recombination frequency. Each lysogenic phage can potentially integrate with a lytic phage at a fraction r. So, the total lysogenic phage in high-dilution would be L = (number of plumes) * (probability of integration). Similarly, the total lytic phage in low-dilution would be Y = (number of plumes) / (1 - r), assuming that the lytic phage integrates at a rate (1 - r) relative to the lysogenic.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Instead, let's think about the relationship between the plumes observed in each culture. The high-dilution culture (lysogenic) should produce plumes proportional to the number of lysogenic phages, minus those that are replicating. Similarly, the low-dilution culture (lytic) should produce plumes proportional to the number of lytic phages, minus those that are replicating.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- L = total lysogenic phage in high-dilution\n- Y = total lytic phage in low-dilution\n\nWe know that in high-dilution, each plume corresponds to one lysogenic phage. However, since some lysogenic phages are replicating, the actual number of new lysogenic phages introduced is L * (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. So, L = Y + L * (1 - r).\n\nSimilarly, in low-dilution, each plume corresponds to one lytic phage. Some lytic phages replicate, so the actual number is Y * (1 - r). So, the number of plumes is proportional to Y * (1 - r).\n\nPutting it together:\nL = Y + L * (1 - r)\nY * (1 - r) = P_plumes_low_dilution\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Another way is to consider that the recombination frequency affects the distribution of plasmids between the two cultures.\n\nGiven that we have plumes in both cultures, the expected number of plumes in each depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\nNumber of plumes = F * N, where F is the frequency and N is the number of cells.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Let me simplify.\n\nSince we have 40 plumes in the high-dilution and 4 in the low-dilution, and knowing that each plume represents a replication event, we can estimate the frequencies.\n\nIn the high-dilution (lysogenic):\nTotal lysogenic phage = 40 / (1 - r)\n\nIn the low-dilution (lytic):\nTotal lytic phage = 4 / (1 - r)\n\nBut also, the actual number of lysogenic phages should be greater than the lytic ones, since each lysogenic phage can integrate with a lytic one at a frequency r.\n\nSo, 40 / (1 - r) > 4 / (1 - r)\n\nWhich simplifies to 40 > 4, which is true regardless of r. But we need to find r such that the plumes correspond correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes in the two cultures should reflect the product of their respective frequencies adjusted by the recombination probability.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = frequency of lysogenic phage\n- q = frequency of lytic phage\n- r = recombination frequency\n\nFrom the high-dilution culture:\nTotal lysogenic = 40 = p / (1 - r)\n\nFrom the low-dilution culture:\nTotal lytic = 4 = q / (1 - r)\n\nBut lysogenic and lytic phages are mutually exclusive, except for recombinant forms. Wait, no, the T_4 phage can't be both lysogenic and lytic. So, the actual frequencies would be:\n\nTotal phages = lysogenic + lytic + recombinant\n\nBut this complicates things. Alternatively, considering that in a normal situation without recombination, lysogenic and lytic phages would coexist without interfering. With recombination, some phages would integrate with lysogenic ones, reducing the number of free phages.\n\nHowever, in our experiment, we have separate counts for lysogenic and lytic plumes, which suggests that the phages are acting independently in each culture, which isn't realistic because they share the same cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct model is that the lysogenic phage can integrate with the lytic phage at a rate r, affecting both their frequencies.\n\nThus, the observed lysogenic plumes include those that successfully integrated (Y * (1 - r)) plus those that replicated (L * r), where L is the number of new lysogenic phages. But this gets complex.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the total number of plumes in each culture is proportional to the square root of the product of their frequencies. According to the square root rule, the number of plumes is approximately the square root of the number of cells times the square root of the product of their frequencies.\n\nSo, sqrt(L * Y) \u2248 number of plumes.\n\nApplying this approximation:\n\nFor the high-dilution (lysogenic culture):\nsqrt(40 * Y) \u2248 ?\n\nFor the low-dilution (lytic culture):\nsqrt(Y * 4) \u2248 ?\n\nBut this is speculative. Without precise calculations, it's challenging to determine r accurately.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to note that the recombination frequency is the proportion of times the two mutations interact. Given the results, we have 40 plumes in one culture and 4 in another. The difference suggests that most of the lysogenic phage is interacting with the lytic phage, hence the recombination frequency is high.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest is D (0.02%) and E (0.05%). Given that the results suggest significant interaction, E (0.05%) might be plausible, but it's very low. Alternatively, since the lysogenic phage is in high-dilution and lytic in low-dilution, the recombination could be around 2% or 5%.\n\nWait, another thought: the square root rule says that the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(frequency1 * frequency2). So, if in the high-dilution, we have 40 plumes, and in the low-dilution, 4 plumes, then:\n\nsqrt(40 * Y) \u2248 number of plumes in high-dilution\nsqrt(Y * 4) \u2248 number of plumes in low-dilution\n\nBut this leads to:\n\nsqrt(40 * Y) = X\nsqrt(Y * 4) = Y'\n\nBut without exact values, it's hard to solve for Y. Alternatively, taking the ratio:\n\nX / Y' = sqrt((40 * Y) / (Y * 4)) )= sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16\n\nBut since X is 40 and Y' is 4, 40/4 =10, which matches sqrt(10)^2=10.\n\nThis suggests that the frequencies are inversely related. Therefore, the product of their frequencies is consistent with the data.\n\nBut this still doesn't help us find r directly. Maybe we need to consider that the recombination frequency affects the expected plume count.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the concept of double-reciprocal inhibition. The maximum number of plumes is when neither mutation is present. As either mutation increases, the number decreases.\n\nThe recombination frequency determines the degree of inhibition. A higher recombination frequency reduces the effect of both mutations.\n\nGiven that the experiment shows a significant interaction, the recombination frequency is likely high. Among the options, E (0.05%) and D (0.02%) are low, while C (1.5%) and G (0.5%) are moderate and high respectively.\n\nConsidering that the results are quite pronounced (40 vs 4), the recombination frequency is likely around 2%. So option B (2%) is a possibility.\n\nBut wait, 0.05% is even lower. Given that 40 plumes in high-dilution and 4 in low-dilution, the interaction is substantial, so the recombination frequency is probably around 5%, making E the answer.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because the square root rule suggested a relation between the products, but without solving for r, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, given the results, the most probable answer is E",

Wait, actually, no\u2014the first half is tested against B's lawn, and the second against K. So let me clarify:\n\n- After infection, the culture is split into two equal parts.\n- The first part is treated with strain B's lawn plates (with 40 plumes on K and 4 on B).\n- The second part is treated with strain K's lawn plates (also showing 40 plumes on K and 4 on B).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If both types of phages are present, each half will be treated separately. So one half is tested against strain B's lawn, meaning it should grow well if the mutation in that phage is functional. Similarly, the other half is tested against strain K's lawn. \n\nIn the experiment, four pluses were found on K's lawn, which suggests that some phages are working in K, possibly due to recombination or mutation. On B's lawn, there were 40 plumes, indicating successful growth without any issues since those plumes would have been from phages that didn't cause lysis, perhaps due to the lysogenic mutation being lost.\n\nNow, the key point is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two loci. In the context of phages, this could mean that one mutation allows the phage to replicate more effectively while the other affects its ability to lyse the host.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the host but the lytic one does, when both types are present, only the lysogenic one will cause problems. However, if there's recombination, the lysogenic phage might lose its ability to function properly when combined with another mutation.\n\nLooking at the numbers: on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes grew, meaning these were from phages that didn't cause lysis. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes grew. This suggests that the lysogenic phage causing issues was present in some proportion. If we assume that recombination occurred, we'd expect fewer plumes on strain K because some lysogenic phages lost their ability to function when recombined.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination. To calculate this, we can use the formula for recombinant frequency (RF):\n\nRF = [1 - (p * q)] / [(1 - p)(1 - q)]\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. Alternatively, using the percentage of recombinant plumes, which can be calculated as:\n\nPercentage recombinant = (Number of recombinant plumes / Total number of plumes) * 100\n\nFrom the data, the total number of plumes across both plates is 80 (40 on B and 40 on K? No, wait\u2014each half is 40 plumes, so total per plate is 80 plumes. Each plate is 80 plumes.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the lysogenic phage is the problem, and we're seeing some plumes on strain K, which suggests that some of the lysogenic phage mutants are now non-functional due to recombination.\n\nSo, assuming that recombination happened, the number of plumes on strain K would decrease because some of the lysogenic phages that shouldn't have worked anymore are now causing issues.\n\nIf the expected number of plumes on strain B is 80 (since all lysogenic phages should work), and on K, it's 4, that's a reduction by a factor of 20. Assuming that recombination caused this, we can estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1 - r)^n\n\nWhere n is the number of independent assortment events, typically 2.\n\nAssuming recombination occurs once, then:\n\nr = 1 - ((80 - 4)/80)\n\n= 1 - (76/80)\n\n= 1 - 0.95\n\n= 0.05\n\nWhich is 5%. That seems high, but considering that 76 out of 80 plumes are recombinant, it's plausible.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Plumes) / (Total Plumes)\n\nHere, 4 out of 80 is 0.05 or 5%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is 0.5 percent, which is close. Option F is 0.3 percent, D is 0.05%, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Let me double-check. If 4 plumes are on K, that's 5% of the total. Option D is 0.05%, which is much lower than 5%. Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the probability that a phage has recombined. If the lysogenic phage can't function when recombining, then the chance of that happening is the recombination rate.\n\nGiven that 4 plumes are on K, which means 4 phages are non-functional due to recombination. So the recombination rate would be 4/80 = 0.05, which is 5%. But none of the options match exactly; the closest is G (0.5%) and D (0.05%).\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: on B, 40 plumes, all good except none. On K, 4 plumes, which implies that 36 are normal. So the ratio is 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%. But looking at the options, D is 0.05%, which is 0.0005, which is way off.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me try again. The total number of plumes is 40 on B and 40 on K, totaling 80. Out of these, 4 are on K, meaning 36 on B. So the probability of recombination is 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%. None of the options directly give 5%. The closest is G (0.5%), which is an order of magnitude less.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach uses the formula for recombinant frequency in a dihybrid cross. The observed recombinant plumes are 4 out of 80, which gives a recombinant frequency of 5%. However, this isn't among the choices provided. The closest is G (0.5%), which is too low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the scenario. Maybe the number of plumes indicates how many times the lysogenic phage failed to lyse the host, suggesting that some recombination occurred. If the recombination rate is x, then the probability that a phage carries both mutations is x\u00b2.\n\nSuppose that the number of recombinant plumes is 4, which could indicate that some combination of the two mutations led to failure. Using the formula for dihybrid crosses, the expected recombinant plumes would be 2xy/(x+y), where x and y are the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Another approach is to realize that the number of plumes on K is 4, which is 5% of the total. Therefore, the recombination rate is approximately 5%, which corresponds to option G (0.5%). However, 5% is closer to option G (0.5%) than to option D (0.05%). But wait, 0.5% is 0.005, whereas 5% is 0.05, which is ten times larger.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate. The total number of plumes is 40 + 40 = 80. On K, 4 are recombinant, so 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%. But the options don't include 5%. The closest is G (0.5%) and D (0.05%). However, 5% is 5, not 0.5. So perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual number of plumes indicates how many times the lysogenic phage successfully replicated without causing lysis. If recombination occurred, some of these would fail. Suppose that recombination occurs at a rate of r. Then the fraction of successful replication would be (1 - r), since recombination reduces efficiency.\n\nIf the observed number of successful replications on K is 4, and the total possible is 80, then 4 = 80*(1 - r). Solving for r: 1 - r = 4/80 = 0.05 \u2192 r = 0.95. That can't be right because that would imply almost complete recombination, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of successful plumes on K is 4, implying that 4 phages did not cause lysis due to recombination. So the success rate is 4/80 = 0.05, which is 5%. Therefore, the recombination rate is 5%, which matches option G (0.5%). However, 5% is 5, not 0.5. The options don't have 5%, so perhaps I'm still misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes on K is 4, which represents the number of recombinant phages. The total number is 80, so the recombinant frequency is 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%. Since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.5%, corresponding to option G. Because sometimes the calculations involve probabilities squared, leading to a smaller number. For example, if the recombination rate is 0.05 (5%), the probability that both mutations occur is 0.05\u00b2 = 0.0025, or 0.25%, which is close to option G (0.5%). But this complicates things further.\n\nI think I'll go with option G (0.5%) as the closest approximation to the 5% recombinant frequency calculated from the data.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The closest is G (0.5%), which is too low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the scenario. Maybe the number of plumes indicates how many times the lysogenic phage failed to lyse the host, suggesting that some recombination occurred. If the recombination rate is x, then the probability that a phage carries both mutations is x\u00b2.\n\nSuppose that the number of recombinant plumes is 4, which could indicate that some combination of the two mutations led to failure. Using the formula for dihybrid crosses, the expected recombinant plumes would be 2xy/(x+y), where x and y are the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Another approach is to realize that the number of plumes on K is 4, which is 5% of the total. Therefore, the recombination rate is approximately 5%, which corresponds to option G (0.5%). However, 5% is closer to option G (0.5%) than to option D (0.05%). But wait, 0.5% is 0.005, whereas 5% is 0.05, which is ten times larger.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate. The total number of plumes is 40 + 40 = 80. On K, 4 are recombinant, so 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%. But the options don't include 5%. The closest is G (0.5%) and D (0.05%). However, 5% is 5, not 0.5. So perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual number of plumes indicates how many times the lysogenic phage successfully replicated without causing lysis. If recombination occurred, some of these would fail. Suppose that recombination occurs at a rate of r. Then the fraction of successful replication would be (1 - r), since recombination reduces efficiency.\n\nIf the observed number of successful replications on K is 4, and the total possible is 80, then 4 = 80*(1 - r). Solving for r: 1 - r = 4/80 = 0.05 \u2192 r = 0.95. That can't be right because that would imply almost complete recombination, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of successful plumes on K is 4, implying that 4 phages did not cause lysis due to recombination. So the success rate is 4/80 = 0.05, which is 5%. Therefore, the recombination rate is 5%, which matches option G (0.5%). However, 5% is 5, not 0.5. The options don't have 5%, so perhaps I'm still misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes on K is 4, which represents the number of recombinant phages. The total number is 80, so the recombinant frequency is 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%. Since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.5%, corresponding to option G. Because sometimes the calculations involve probabilities squared, leading to a smaller number. For example, if the recombination rate is 0.05 (5%), the probability that both mutations occur is 0.05\u00b2 = 0.0025, or 0.25%, which is close to option G (0.5%). But this complicates things further.\n\nI think I'll go with option G (0.5%) as the closest approximation to the 5% recombinant frequency calculated from the data.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

One half is dilute (1:10^7), meaning each bacterium has many fewer phages around, which should allow more random encounter of mutants. The other half is even less dilute (1:10^5). They then plate these on the same lawn as another strain, either B or K, depending on which half was treated.\n\nFrom the results:\n- On the B lawn, there were four pluses (lytic fission).\n- On the K lawn, four pluses were also found.\n- Total pluses found across both halves: 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, each half is tested separately. So for the first half (dilute), they're on strain B, and for the second half (more dilute), they're on strain K. Each half shows four plus colonies. So total pluses are 8.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. If both halves are on the same type of bacteria, it might complicate things. Actually, each half is placed on a different strain, so the counts should be additive.\n\nSo, from the data:\n- Dilute half (1:10^7): Plated on B, found 4 pluses.\n- More dilute half (1:10^5): Plated on K, found 4 pluses.\n\nTotal pluses: 8.\n\nNow, how do we calculate recombination? Recombination refers to the chance that a mutation from one phage and another from another phage combine into a single phage. In the context of E. coli, if a lysogenic phage mutates (like having an extra gene) and a non-lysogenic phage also mutates, their combination could lead to a new phage strain.\n\nIn experiments like this, the number of double mutants depends on the frequency of individual mutants and the probability of them combining. The formula often used is:\n\nNumber of double mutants = (p * q * r) where p, q, r are the frequencies of each mutation. However, since we have two types of mutations here, let me clarify.\n\nEach mutation occurs independently. For example, suppose mutation A occurs in 1% of phages and mutation B occurs in 1% of phages. Then, the probability that a single phage carries both A and B would be 1% * 1% = 0.01%. But in our case, we have two different mutantphages, so we need to consider their interaction.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that there are two types of mutantphages: one causing lytic fission and the other lysogenic. The recombination would occur when a mutation arises due to the interaction of these two types.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose the original phage has a certain mutation rate, say 1% for mutation X, and the other mutantphage has a mutation rate Y at, say, 1%.\n\nWhen these interact, the recombination frequency (RF) is the product of their individual frequencies. So RF = p * q.\n\nIf the total number of pluses observed is proportional to the RF, then we can set up an equation.\n\nGiven that the total pluses on K and B are 4 each, totaling 8. Assuming that the RF is the proportion of double mutants, perhaps 8 corresponds to the expected number under some RF.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation for a double mutant (both mutated) would be (p * q) times the total cells. Since we have two separate plates (one on B, one on K), maybe we can relate the observed pluses to the expected values.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the mutation rates as follows:\n- Mutation X (from phage 1): frequency p.\n- Mutation Y (from phage 2): frequency q.\n\nThe expected number of double mutants would be p * q * N, where N is the total number of phages (or bacteria). But since we don't know N, we can assume that the pluses correspond directly to the RF.\n\nGiven that on both sides, the pluses add up to 8, perhaps each side contributes equally. Alternatively, since the plates are placed on different bacterial strains, the counts might be independent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the ratio of pluses to the total. Since on K, 4 pluses were found, and on B, 4 pluses were found, the ratio is equal. This suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the expected pluses match this ratio.\n\nAssuming that the expected number of pluses is proportional to the RF, and given that each half had 4 pluses, perhaps the total pluses are twice that, so 8.\n\nTherefore, if the RF is R, and the expected number of pluses is R * total, then:\n\nR = (expected pluses) / total = 8 / (total phages exposed).\n\nBut without knowing the total number, perhaps it's easier to express R in terms of the observed pluses.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed pluses on each half are 4, the total pluses are 8, and assuming that the pluses are proportional to the RF, we can write:\n\nExpected pluses = R * (number of encounters)\n\nSince each half is treated separately, the number of encounters per bacterium varies based on dilution.\n\nFor the first half (dilute):\nNumber of encounters per bacterium = 1e7 + 1 (since it's 1:10^7)\nTotal encounters = N * (1e7 + 1)\n\nSimilarly, for the second half (less dilute):\nNumber of encounters = N * (1e5 + 1)\n\nBut since the actual counts depend on the mutation probabilities, the expected pluses would be:\n\nOn the B half: (mutation X) * (mutation Y) * N * (1e7 + 1) = 4\n\nOn the K half: Same calculation, resulting in 4.\n\nThus, setting them equal:\n\n(p * q) * N * (1e7 + 1) = 4\n\nBut without knowing N, we can solve for p*q:\n\np*q = 4 / [N * (1e7 + 1)]\n\nHowever, since both equations give the same value for p*q, we can take the average or consider that the overall RF is such that the sum of pluses gives us the expected count.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the individual mutation rates. Given that the observed pluses are 4 on each half, the total pluses suggest that the RF is high enough to cause significant interference in plasmid formation.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers are percentages, ranging from 0.05% to 5%.\n\nRecombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, typically between 0% and 100%, though lower values indicate less recombination.\n\nConsidering the observed pluses, if the recombination frequency is 0.05%, that seems low, but given the large dilution factors (1e5 vs 1e7), the chance of recombination is small.\n\nAlternatively, 0.05% might seem very low, but perhaps the calculations align differently.\n\nAnother angle: if the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of double mutants would be R multiplied by the number of encounters. Since each encounter has a probability R of being a double mutant.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that the pluses are 4 on each half, which totals 8, perhaps R is approximately 0.05% because 0.05% of 8 would be 0.04, but this isn't precise.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of pluses is proportional to the product of the mutation frequencies. Therefore, if the observed pluses are 8, and assuming that each plus comes from a double mutant, then R would be 8/N. But without N, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the square root of the observed fraction of double mutants. Wait, no, that's for interference.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for recombinant plasmids. The expected number of double mutants is p*q*N, where N is the population size. The observed number of plasmids is proportional to this.\n\nGiven that, and that the observed pluses are 8, we can estimate p*q as 8/(N*(1e7+1)).\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to find exact numbers. Perhaps the answer expects us to use the ratio of pluses.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Similarly, the same for K. So each half is on a different bacterial strain.\n\nPerhaps the pluses are proportional to the product of the mutation frequencies. So if on B, 4 pluses, and on K, 4 pluses, the total is 8. The expected number would be p*q*2 (because two halves). So 8 = 2*p*q => p*q=4.\n\nExpressed as a percentage, 4 would be 4/100=0.04, which is 0.04%, but the closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual RF is calculated using the formula involving the dilution factors. The dilution factors affect the number of encounters and thus the likelihood of recombination.\n\nThe dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5. The expected number of plasmids would be proportional to the product of the mutation frequencies and the dilution factor.\n\nSo, for the first half (dilute, 1e7):\n\nNumber of plasmids = p*q*(1e7)*N = 4\n\nSecond half (dilute, 1e5):\n\nNumber of plasmids = p*q*(1e5)*N = 4\n\nWait, but both produce 4 plasmids, so adding them together gives 8.\n\nSo, from the first equation: p*q*(1e7)*N = 4 --> Equation 1\n\nFrom the second: p*q*(1e5)*N = 4 --> Equation 2\n\nDividing Equation 1 by Equation 2: (1e7)/(1e5) = 100 = (N)/(N) = 1\n\nThis implies that 100 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plasmids formed are proportional to the product of mutation frequencies and the dilution factor. So:\n\np*q*(1e7) = 4\n\nand\n\np*q*(1e5) = 4\n\nBut again, dividing these gives 1e2 = 1, which is impossible. Hence, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the dilution factors and focus solely on the number of plasmids.\n\nIf each half produces 4 plasmids, then total plasmids are 8. Assuming that the plasmids form randomly with a probability of p*q, then the expected number of plasmids would be N * p*q.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's difficult. Maybe the problem expects a rough estimation based on the ratio of plasmids.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key lies in recognizing that the observed plasmids on each strain are proportional to the product of mutation probabilities. Thus, if the plasmids on B are 4 and on K are 4, the product p*q must be the same in both cases.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe looking at the answer choices helps. The options include 0.02% (J) and 0.05% (I), which are quite low. Another thought: perhaps the recombination is so rare that the plasmids don't accumulate much, hence the 0.02% or 0.05% figures.\n\nWait, considering that the dilutions are 1e7 and 1e5, which are huge, the chance of recombination is extremely low. Thus, the recombination frequency would likely be around 0.02% or 0.05%, corresponding to options J or I.\n\nBut why? Because the chance of any single recombination event happening is minuscule, especially with such high dilution factors. Therefore, the recombination frequency is very low, supporting options J or I.\n\nBetween J (0.02%) and I (0.05%), I think J is closer to the lower end. But sometimes, in such scenarios, the exact calculation requires knowing more parameters, but given the options, I'll go with J: 0.02%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains get a mix of these phages.\n\nThe experiment involves two halves of the culture. One half is dilute (1:10^7), meaning each bacterium has many fewer phages around, which should allow more random encounter of mutants. The other half is even less dilute (1:10^5). They then plate these on the same lawn as another strain, either B or K, depending on which half was treated.\n\nFrom the results:\n- On the B lawn, there were four pluses (lytic fission).\n- On the K lawn, four pluses were also found.\n- Total pluses found across both halves: 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, each half is tested separately. So for the first half (dilute), they're on strain B, and for the second half (more dilute), they're on strain K. Each half shows four plus colonies. So total pluses are 8.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. If both halves are on the same type of bacteria, it might complicate things. Actually, each half is placed on a different strain, so the counts should be additive.\n\nSo, from the data:\n- Dilute half (1:10^7): Plated on B, found 4 pluses.\n- More dilute half (1:10^5): Plated on K, found 4 pluses.\n\nTotal pluses: 8.\n\nNow, how do we calculate recombination? Recombination refers to the chance that a mutation from one phage and another from another phage combine into a single phage. In the context of E. coli, if a lysogenic phage mutates (like having an extra gene) and a non-lysogenic phage also mutates, their combination could lead to a new phage strain.\n\nIn experiments like this, the number of double mutants depends on the frequency of individual mutants and the probability of them combining.

The initial problem stated that the lysogenic phage is the one that causes division. So the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, while the lytic one does. In the experiment, when both mutants are present, only the lysogenic ones cause problems. So the presence of either mutation doesn't affect the outcome; it's about which type of phage is present.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage itself determines whether it causes division or lysis. So the lysogenic phage would lyse, leading to cell death, whereas the lytic phage just replicates without lysing. Therefore, when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage does anything harmful. So the question is about the mutation in the lysogenic phage, specifically whether it affects replication initiation or not.\n\nIf the mutations are on the same chromosome and recombine, they might have independent effects. If they're on different chromosomes, their effects wouldn't interfere. Since the problem refers to the T_4 genome, which often includes multiple genes, I'm thinking about recombination between these two mutations.\n\nThe number of plumes depends on how many times the phage successfully replicated. Each time it replicates, it can produce a new phage particle. If the phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate past a certain point, it can cause more division than expected, leading to more plumes.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), only four plumes appeared on strain B. That suggests that the phage was successful in replicating enough times. With a higher dilution (1:10^5), more plumes appeared on strain K. So the higher dilution shows that even with more bacteria, the phage was replicating enough times to cause some division.\n\nThe fact that both strains showed similar numbers suggests that the mutations don't lead to excessive replication beyond what is naturally expected. This might imply that the mutations aren't so disruptive that they cause too many plumes.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant bands / Total number of bands) * 100%\n\nBut looking at the data, when both mutants are present, the number of plumes on each strain isn't drastically different. It seems like the recombination didn't lead to a significant increase in plumes beyond what was observed. Maybe the recombination is low.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the number of plumes. When both mutants are present, the total plumes are split between the two strains. The number of plumes on each might indicate the probability of the mutation being effective.\n\nGiven that both strains show four plumes each, it suggests that the mutation didn't significantly impact either strain. If the mutations were recombining, it might lead to an increase in plumes due to independent events. But in this case, it decreased.\n\nWait, actually, when you mix two mutations, if they are independent (no recombination), the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is the product of their individual probabilities. If they are recombining, the probability changes.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try a different angle. The problem states that when both mutants are present, half of the colonies are on strain B and half on K. Then, each half is plated on different lichens.\n\nStrain B's half has four plumes on K. Wait, no\u2014wait, when the phage is on strain B, the presence of lysogenic phage leads to division, so if both mutants are present, only the lysogenic ones do that. But the question says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Hmm, maybe I misread that part.\n\nWait, the question says: \"The resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nSo half the colonies are on strain B's lawn, and half are on K's. The half on B are treated with a high dilution (1:10^7), meaning fewer bacteria. The half on K is treated with a lower dilution (1:10^5).\n\nOn the B lawn, four plumes were found. On the K lawn, four plumes were also found. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the K strain's lawn should have fewer plumes if the phage is less likely to replicate. Or did I get that wrong?\n\nActually, when you plate on a strain, any plasmid in the phage will lyse unless it's on the host. So if the phage is on strain B, any mutation in the phage that causes replication past a certain point will cause division, leading to plumes. Similarly for strain K.\n\nBut in this case, both strains have four plumes. Maybe it's indicating that both mutants caused division in those plasmids. But why would half of the colonies have four plumes each? That seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The initial scenario is that two types of mutant phages are present, and they both cause division in E. coli strain B. When both are present, the population is divided into two halves, each half is plated on different strains.\n\nWhen you plate on strain B, you expect that any mutation in the phage that causes division would cause division in the E. coli, leading to plumes. Similarly, when you plate on strain K, the same happens. But in the experiment, both halves had four plumes. That seems confusing. Maybe I misunderstood the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment measures the number of plumes on each strain after mixing. Since half the colonies are on B's lawn and half on K's, each group is tested separately. So on B's lawn, four plumes are found, and on K's, four are also found. But that would suggest that the mutations affected both strains similarly, which might indicate low recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So if recombination is occurring, it might mean that the two mutations are located on different copies of a gene, leading to independent effects.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for recombination frequency:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant bands / total number of bands) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes might correspond to the occurrence of recombination. If the mutations are on different chromosomes, you'd expect some interference or reduced plasmid formation. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes, which indicates the success rate of replication. Lower dilutions (higher concentrations) mean more chance for plasmid replication. Higher dilutions (lower concentration) mean less chance.\n\nSince both groups (on B and K) have the same number of plumes, it suggests that the mutations didn't lead to excessive replication beyond natural limits. This might imply low recombination because excessive recombination would lead to more plasmid replication events.\n\nTherefore, if the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%, the answer would be J. 0.05 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets divided equally into two groups.\n\nThe first group is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. This means each culture has fewer bacteria, so there's less chance of random clustering forming a lytic ring. They found four plumes on B. \n\nThe second group is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Here, each culture has more bacteria, increasing the likelihood of random clumping. On K's lawn, they found four plumes as well.\n\nNow, the goal is to determine how much these mutations recombine. Recombination would mean that the two mutations occur at different sites within the same gene, allowing them to influence the same target site (like the replication origin) independently. If they're recombined, their effects might be additive or synergistic.\n\nIn experiments like this, when the mutation occurs early enough that its effect on replication initiation is still detectable, you can see if it affects multiple regions. For instance, in E. coli, the lysogenic phage carries a promoter near the replication origin. If a mutation occurs close enough to this promoter, it can influence replication initiation.\n\nLooking at the results, since both mutations are causing issues in the lysogenic phage, which leads to lytic rings (lysis), I think the key here is whether the two mutations are affecting the same point. If they were on separate origins, then perhaps each could cause a different effect. However, if they are recombining, maybe the combined effect increases the number of plumes.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

This means there's a lot of dilution, which probably reduces the chance of random plating events leading to successful infection. Then, four plusions are found on strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Here, there's less dilution since the plates are larger, increasing the likelihood of random plating, resulting in four plusions on K as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you dilute a sample, if it's more concentrated, fewer plusions occur because it's harder for the phage to reach the bacteria. So if the first half was more diluted (1:10^7), then fewer plusions would be expected, right? Because even though the phage is active, the concentration is too low to get enough plusions without just killing everything or causing random plusions.\n\nBut in reality, sometimes you might see some plusions if the concentration isn't exactly right. However, in this case, the first half shows four plusions, and the second half shows four again. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the dilutions work here. Alternatively, perhaps the initial number of phages affects the outcome.\n\nLet me think about the process. Each phage type has a certain mutation rate in the T_4 genome. Let's denote the mutation rates as m1 for lysogenic phages and m2 for lytic phages. The recombination frequency refers to how often these mutations occur together in the phage DNA. If the mutations are independent, the probability that both are present is m1 * m2.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phage types are present, the E. coli strains are divided into two halves. One half is plated on strain B, where only lysogenic phages cause an issue. The other half is plated on strain K. Since strain B and K have different outcomes, we can infer something about their replication and mutation rates.\n\nWait, another approach: when only lysogenic phages are present (strain B), the phages replicate without lysis, leading to increased replication efficiency. Conversely, when only lytic phages are present (strain K), replication is blocked, reducing efficiency. So if both are present, the lysogenic phages take over, leading to reduced replication in strain K.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed, the E. coli in the first half (strained B) should have higher replication because the lysogenic phages don't lyse them. In the second half (strained K), the lysogenic phages lyse the cells, so there's less replication. The fact that the first half has some plusions suggests that despite the dilution, the phages are still able to infect some E. coli in that half. The second half, however, shows no plusions, meaning the phages aren't infecting any E. coli there.\n\nSo, if the phages in the first half were successfully infecting some E. coli, but the second half didn't, what does that tell us about their replication rates and mutation rates?\n\nI think the key here is to calculate the probabilities of the phages replicating successfully in each strain. For strain B, which is lysogenic, the phages shouldn't lyse it, so they should replicate better. For strain K, which is lytic, the phages lyse it, so replication should be worse.\n\nIf the mutation rate in the phages is such that the lysogenic phages can replicate in strain K, but not in strain B, then the presence of plusions in the first half indicates that some of the phages can replicate successfully in strain B, while none do in K.\n\nAssuming that the number of plusions corresponds to the number of successful infections, let's model this. Suppose that the probability of a phage successfully replicating in strain B is p_B and in strain K is p_K. The number of plusions observed should relate to these probabilities multiplied by the total number of phages.\n\nGiven that the first half is plated on B and has four plusions, and the second half is plated on K and has four plusions, we can set up equations:\n\nNumber of plusions = (Total phages) * p_B / Dilution factor\n\nSimilarly for K.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let's consider that when the phages are mixed, the dilution affects the probability. Maybe instead, the ratio of plusions can give us information about the relative replication success in each strain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when only lysogenic phages are present (strain B), the phages should replicate without issue, so the number of plusions should be high. When both types are present, the lysogenic phages take over in strain K, causing fewer plusions.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for recombination frequency, which is calculated as f = 1 - e^{-2p}, assuming independent mutation events. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of four plusions in both halves implies that the phages are replicating successfully in both strains. However, in the first half, which is more diluted, the same number of plusions occurs, suggesting that the phages are more likely to replicate in that strain due to lower dilution. Wait, that seems contradictory because if the first half is more diluted, the chance of randomly selecting a viable phage is lower, so the number of plusions should be lower unless the phages are highly effective.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem relates to the concept of interference in replication. If the two mutations are linked, the occurrence of one affects the replication of the other. But the question asks specifically about the recombination frequency between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination frequency is usually measured in terms of double crossovers, but here it's about mutations in the same gene. So the term used here might be \"recombination coefficient\" or \"coincidence,\" which measures the correlation between two mutations.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to determine the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. That could mean calculating the percentage of times both mutations occurred in the same position, i.e., co-occurrence.\n\nBut in this context, recombination frequency is typically the fraction of double crossovers. However, in this scenario, it's about two mutations in the same gene. Maybe it's referring to the coincidence of the mutations occurring in the same orientation, which affects replication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the probability that both mutations occur in the same region, affecting the replication efficiency. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe looking at the numbers given will help. The first half (more dilute) has four plusions, and the second half (less dilute) also has four plusions. If the first half had more plusions, that might indicate that the phages were more effectively infecting those bacteria, implying higher replication success.\n\nWait, but if the first half is more diluted, the chance of randomly picking a phage that can infect is lower, so the number of plusions should be lower. But in this case, it's the same number of plusions. So maybe the phages are more effective than expected, indicating that the mutations lead to increased replication in that strain.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for similar problems or examples. I recall that in some cases, the number of plusions can indicate the degree of interference in replication. If the two mutations interfere, the interference (or co-coupling) is higher.\n\nIn this case, since the first half shows more plusions than expected under pure competition, it suggests that the mutations are working together to increase replication in that strain. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be high, indicating strong interference.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest value is H.5 percent. But I thought the answer might be lower. Alternatively, maybe the calculation involves the number of plusions and the dilution factors.\n\nLet me try to model this.

Given that in the first half, four plusions are found, and in the second half, four as well, we can set up equations based on the dilution.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact dilution factors, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the difference in plusions reflects the effect of the mutations. If the mutations are redundant, more plusions would be expected; if they're interfering, fewer.\n\nSince the first half has more plusions than expected, it suggests that the mutations allow both to contribute to replication in that strain, meaning they're interfering. The second half having zero plusions indicates that in strain K, neither mutation allows replication, so the mutations must be fully disrupting replication in that strain.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, which in this case might correspond to the degree of interference, I can use the formula for interference:\n\nInterference (I) = 1 - e^{-2p}\n\nWhere p is the probability of a single mutation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains split evenly, with each half being half the original size. \n\nThe first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. This means there's a lot of dilution, which probably reduces the chance of random plating events leading to successful infection. Then, four plusions are found on strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Here, there's less dilution since the plates are larger, increasing the likelihood of random plating, resulting in four plusions on K as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you dilute a sample, if it's more concentrated, fewer plusions occur because it's harder for the phage to reach the bacteria. So if the first half was more diluted (1:10^7), then fewer plusions would be expected, right? Because even though the phage is active, the concentration is too low to get enough plusions without just killing everything or causing random plusions.\n\nBut in reality, sometimes you might see some plusions if the concentration isn't exactly right. However, in this case, the first half shows four plusions, and the second half shows four again. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the dilutions work here. Alternatively, perhaps the initial number of phages affects the outcome.\n\nLet me think about the process. Each phage type has a certain mutation rate in the T_4 genome. Let's denote the mutation rates as m1 for lysogenic phages and m2 for lytic phages. The recombination frequency refers to how often these mutations occur together in the phage DNA. If the mutations are independent, the probability that both are present is m1 * m2.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phage types are present, the E. coli strains are divided into two halves. One half is plated on strain B, where only lysogenic phages cause an issue. The other half is plated on strain K. Since strain B and K have different outcomes, we can infer something about their replication and mutation rates.\n\nWait, another approach: when only lysogenic phages are present (strain B), the phages replicate without lysis, leading to increased replication efficiency. Conversely, when only lytic phages are present (strain K), replication is blocked, reducing efficiency. So if both are present, the lysogenic phages take over, leading to reduced replication in strain K.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed, the E. coli in the first half (strained B) should have higher replication because the lysogenic phages don't lyse them. In the second half (strained K), the lysogenic phages lyse the cells, so there's less replication. The fact that the first half has some plusions suggests that despite the dilution, the phages are still able to infect some E. coli in that half. The second half, however, shows no plusions, meaning the phages aren't infecting any E. coli there.\n\nSo, if the phages in the first half were successfully infecting some E. coli, but the second half didn't, what does that tell us about their replication rates and mutation rates?\n\nI think the key here is to calculate the probabilities of the phages replicating successfully in each strain. For strain B, which is lysogenic, the phages shouldn't lyse it, so they should replicate better. For strain K, which is lytic, the phages lyse it, so replication should be worse.\n\nIf the mutation rate in the phages is such that the lysogenic phages can replicate in strain K, but not in strain B, then the presence of plusions in the first half indicates that some of the phages can replicate successfully in strain B, while none do in K.\n\nAssuming that the number of plusions corresponds to the number of successful infections, let's model this. Suppose that the probability of a phage successfully replicating in strain B is p_B and in strain K is p_K. The number of plusions observed should relate to these probabilities multiplied by the total number of phages.\n\nGiven that the first half is plated on B and has four plusions, and the second half is plated on K and has four plusions, we can set up equations:\n\nNumber of plusions = (Total phages) * p_B / Dilution factor\n\nSimilarly for K.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused.

Hmm, this seems like a case where the presence of the lysogenic mutation increases the likelihood of lysogeny in the next generation. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage has increased the chances of being expressed as a new phage.\n\nNow, the question asks about the recombination rate between the two mutations. Recombination refers to how often these mutations occur together within the same DNA segment. Since the experiment involved testing different plating strengths and seeing the distribution, I think we're dealing with something related to the number of recombinants or the efficiency of crossing over during replication.\n\nIn genetic crosses, especially involving independent assortment, the expected number of recombinant offspring can be calculated using the formula (1/4)(n choose k), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, if we consider the probability of each type of offspring arising from different parental combinations, maybe we can model this scenario.\n\nLet me break down the results:\n\n- Half of the population is plated on strain B (resulting in 4 pluses).\n- Another half is plated on strain K (resulting in 4 pluses on K and 40 on B).\n\nWait, actually, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So the first half was on B, giving 4 pluses; the second half was on K, resulting in 4 pluses on K and 40 on B.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of the lysogenic mutation (let's call it L) on the host E. coli strain K might have increased the expression of the phage. So, when L is present on K, more phages are expressed compared to when L isn't present (on B).\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we usually look at the proportion of recombinant gametes formed during meiosis. If the two mutations are linked, their recombination frequency would determine whether they are inherited together or separately. However, since this is an experiment involving different host strains and varying plating densities, it might be more about the efficiency of crossing over versus the direct effect of the mutations themselves.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers: when half the population is plated on strain K, 4 pluses appear. On strain B, 40 pluses appear. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"the other half is plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B\" for the second half, resulting in 4 pluses on B and 40 on K. Or did I misread that? Let me check again.\n\nNo, wait, the first half is plated on B, resulting in 4 pluses. Then the second half is plated on K, resulting in 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. That means that when the host is K, the number of pluses is lower than when it's B. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive and infect when the host is K, meaning that the lysogenic mutation has crossed the chromosome or is present in the host, increasing its viability.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Maybe the key point is that the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the host (strain K) allows the phage to replicate better, so it survives and becomes expressed, leading to more plasmids or more infections. If the lysogenic mutation is associated with increased recombination or expression, then the recombination frequency could indicate how much of the phage's DNA has been exchanged.\n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Perhaps a simpler approach would help. In genetic terms, if the two mutations (L and R) are linked, the probability of them occurring together (recombinant) is equal to the recombination frequency (RF). The RF is the proportion of individuals who inherit one dominant and one recessive allele that were initially separated by a crossover.\n\nGiven the experimental data, when the host is K, the number of pluses is lower than when it's B. This implies that the lysogenic mutation (L) is more prevalent in K, allowing the phage to replicate more effectively. The increase in plasmid load on K might suggest that the phage is more easily transmitted or that the host K is more resistant to lytic fission, making the lysogenic form more viable.\n\nIf the lysogenic mutation (L) is associated with increased recombination, then the presence of L in the host would lead to more efficient transmission of the phage. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be higher, meaning that the two mutations are closer together on the chromosome.\n\nLooking back at the options, the possible answers range from 0.02% to 5%, with significant differences. Given that recombination frequencies typically fall into certain ranges, and assuming that in this case, the presence of L leads to a higher likelihood of recombination, perhaps around 2% or 5%.\n\nBut without exact calculations, it's hard to pinpoint. However, given the numbers, when the host is K, the number of pluses is less than when it's B, suggesting that the lysogenic mutation is more common in K.

One half is tested against E. coli strain B, and the other against strain K. \n\nIn the first test, the E. coli strain B is plated with a half that was treated with lysogenic phage. It resulted in a saturation divided by half, meaning half of them died. Then this half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated again on strain B. Here, there were 40 plques found. On the other half, which was treated with the lytic phage, it didn't die at all, meaning no plques formed. So from this experiment alone, we know that the lysogenic phage kills E. coli strain B, while the lytic phage isn't effective here.\n\nNow, looking at the second experiment where half of the original sample is plated on strain K. This time, there were 4 plques found on K. Since strain B dies when lysogenic is present, if strain K had a mutation that somehow restores some function, maybe it could survive. However, since only 4 plques survived on K, perhaps some recombination happened between the two mutations.\n\nWait, let me think about how recombination works. Recombination means that parts of the DNA have been joined together between the two mutated genes. In phages, this would mean that the lysogenic phage has incorporated the lysogenic gene into its prophage origin DNA, along with the lysogenic mutation. So when a phage carries both a lysogenic mutation (which would kill the host if used) and a lysogenically inherited mutation (which might rescue), the combination allows the phage to replicate without killing the host.\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage killed strain B when present. If another mutation exists on the T_4 genome, such as a mutation that restores function, then when combined with the lysogenic mutation, the phage should be able to replicate without dying. Therefore, the presence of recombination would explain why some cells survived the lysogenic treatment but not the lytic one.\n\nLooking at the numbers, when the half was plated on strain B, 40 plques appeared, indicating high survival. On strain K, only 4 survived. If there was complete recombination, the number of survivors should reflect the degree of recombination. If recombination occurred, the number of surviving cells would depend on the fraction of the genome that is recombined.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating the probability of recombination between two mutations. The expected number of plques (survivors) would be proportional to the frequency of recombination. The formula is roughly plques = (R / 100)^2 * N, where R is the percentage of recombination. Wait, actually, the formula is more precise: the probability of recombination at each site is p, and the chance of having an R-locus recombinant sequence is approximately 2p(1-p) for small p. For simplicity, if the recombination rate is r%, then the expected number of plques would be (r/100)^2 times the total number of bacteria.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another approach: the number of plques depends on the number of cells that successfully replicated the phage without lysing the host. If there's complete recombination, every cell that took up the phage would have both mutations, allowing replication. But in reality, only a subset would replicate due to the nature of phage replication and selection.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plques is proportional to the efficiency of the phage infection. If there's recombination, more cells will survive, leading to higher plques. Conversely, less recombination would lead to fewer plques, but in our case, the lysogenic phage caused death, so recombination must allow the phage to survive despite the lysogenic mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the initial experiment: when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B dies. When only lytic phage is present, nothing happens. Now, when combining both, the half treated with lysogenic phage (which kills B) is now treated with both lysogenic and lytic phages? Or does each treatment use only one type?\n\nWait, the problem says the other half is treated with the lysogenic phage, which doesn't cause death, hence survives. Then that half is treated with the lytic phage, which doesn't affect it either. So in the first treatment (lysogenic only), strain B dies; in the second (lytic only), nothing happens. When both treatments are applied, the half treated with lysogenic phage (which shouldn't kill B anymore) is further treated with lytic phage. Since the phage carries both mutations, it should replicate without killing the host.\n\nTherefore, the observed outcome suggests that the lytic phage is being used to treat the lysogenic-only half, which is resistant, and vice versa. The difference is in the effectiveness of the lytic phage when used to treat the lysogenic-only half versus the lytic-only half.\n\nThe number of plques on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. Assuming that the same volume is plated, the ratio of plques would indicate the relative success rates of treating the lysogenic-only half with lysogenic vs. lytic phages. Since the lysogenic phage didn't kill B in the first treatment, but did in the second, the lytic phage worked better when used to treat the lysogenic-only half.\n\nSo the number of plques relates to the efficiency of the lytic phage when used to treat the lysogenic-only half. If the lytic phage is more effective here, it suggests that there's some recombination between the lysogenic and lytic phages' mutations.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of plques = (r/100)^2 * N\n\nWhere r is the percentage of recombination. We have 40 plques on B and 4 on K. But wait, if strain B and K have different background levels, perhaps the calculations are adjusted. Alternatively, the ratio of plques can help us determine the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that when using the lytic phage to treat the lysogenic-only half, the number of plques corresponds to the fraction of cells that can take up the phage. If recombination occurs, the plque count reflects the extent of recombination. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage didn't kill B when used alone, but did when mixed with lytic phage, the presence of recombination implies that the lysogenic mutation is compatible with the lytic phage, or vice versa. However, in reality, most lysogenic phages carry their own lysogenic mutation that prevents lysis, so mixing with lytic phage wouldn't cause death. Therefore, the lack of death when lysogenic is used alone suggests that the lysogenic mutation isn't causing the issue, while the lytic phage's effect is dependent on the presence of certain mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in the number of plques. If recombination is high, the number of plques would increase because the phage can integrate the mutation. So, if recombination is high, more cells would take up the phage successfully, resulting in more plques.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage caused death in the lysogenic-only half, but not in the lytic-only half, perhaps the lytic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate even without the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, when used to treat the lysogenic-only half, it effectively selects for the cells that have the lysogenic mutation, allowing the phage to replicate without lysing the host.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the number of successful infections would correspond to the recombination fraction. So, the ratio of plques between the two treatments could give us an idea of recombination. Specifically, the number of plques on B (40) compared to K (4) might relate to the fraction of cells that have the lysogenic mutation. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Crosses) \u00d7 (100)\n\nBut I think this applies to genetic crosses between individuals. Perhaps it's better to use the following formula for estimating recombination frequency based on the number of plques:\n\nRecombination Fraction \u2248 sqrt((Plques_B + Plques_K - Total Plques)/Total Plques)\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. If the lysogenic phage (let's call it L) causes death when used alone, but becomes effective when mixed with the lytic phage (Y). Similarly, the lytic phage Y may also become effective when used with another phage. So, if recombination occurs, the lytic phage Y has a mutation that makes it effective when used with the lysogenic phage L.\n\nThis suggests that the lytic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lysing the host. Therefore, when used to treat the lysogenic-only half, it can replicate successfully, whereas when used alone, it doesn't. The number of plques on strain B (when treated with L) is 40, and on strain K (treated with Y) is 4. If recombination occurs, the fraction of cells that successfully take up the phage would depend on the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that when recombination occurs, the number of successful infections increases. Therefore, the number of plques on strain B (40) is higher than on strain K (4). To find the recombination rate, we can compare these numbers.\n\nThe formula relating plques to recombination is:\n\nPlques = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 N\n\nAssuming N is the same for both treatments, we can set up the equation:\n\n40 = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 N\n4 = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 M\n\nWhere M is the number of cells treated with Y alone. But without knowing M, we can\u2019t directly solve for r. Alternatively, taking the ratio of plques gives:\n\n40 / 4 = [(r/100)^2 \u00d7 N] / [(r/100)^2 \u00d7 M] = N/M\n\nBut again, without knowing N and M, this might not be helpful. Maybe instead, we can consider that the number of plques is proportional to the efficiency of the phage in replicating. Since the lysogenic phage (L) killed B when used alone, but allowed it to grow when mixed with Y, the presence of recombination indicates that the phage Y has a mutation that makes it effective when paired with L.\n\nPerhaps the number of plques on B is inversely related to the recombination rate. If recombination is high, the number of plques would be lower because the phage can't replicate efficiently. Given that on B we have 40 plques and on K 4, which is 10 times less, this suggests that the recombination rate is high enough to reduce the plques by a factor of 10.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nPlques_B / Plques_K = (r/100)^2\n\nSo,\n\n40 / 4 = 10 = (r/100)^2\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\u221a10 \u2248 3.16 \u2248 r/100 \u2192 r \u2248 316%\n\nWait, that can't be right because recombination rates are usually expressed as percentages of the possible combinations, which are typically around 0.5% to 1%. So, getting 316% seems impossible. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the formula. The correct formula for the number of plques when recombining is:\n\nPlques = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 N\n\nWhere N is the number of cells treated. But since both treatments involve the same number of cells (assuming they're equally dilute), the ratio of plques is equal to the ratio of (r/100)^2.\n\nGiven that on B, plques = 40, and on K, plques = 4, the ratio is 40/4 = 10. Therefore:\n\n(r/100)^2 = 10 \u2192 r/100 = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16 \u2192 r \u2248 316%\n\nAgain, this is impossible because recombination rates cannot exceed 100%. So, clearly, my assumption is incorrect. Perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of plques depends on the efficiency of the phage. The efficiency can be modeled as e = (1 - r/100), where r is the recombination rate in percent. So, plques would scale with e^2. Therefore:\n\nplques_B / plques_K = [e_B]^2 / [e_K]^2\n\nWe don't know e_B or e_K, but perhaps we can make an assumption. If the lysogenic phage (L) kills the host when used alone, then e_L = 0 (no efficiency). However, when mixed with the lytic phage (Y), e_Y > 0. So, e_Y is greater than e_L.\n\nIf the number of plques on B is much higher than on K, it suggests that e_Y is significantly higher than e_L, which aligns with the fact that recombination allows Y to replicate even without L.\n\nAssuming that the number of plques on B is proportional to e_Y^2 and on K proportional to e_K^2, and given that plques_B = 40 and plques_K = 4, the ratio is 10. So:\n\n(e_Y / e_K)^2 = 10 \u2192 e_Y / e_K = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16\n\nWhich implies that e_Y is 3.16 times higher than e_K. Since e_Y = 1 - (r_Y / 100) and similarly for e_K, and assuming that the recombination rates for L and Y are similar (both involving T_4 genome), say r_L \u2248 r_Y = r, then:\n\n(1 - (r / 100))^Y_B / (1 - (r / 100))^Y_K = \u221a10\n\nBut without knowing the actual efficiency differences, this still doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approximation is needed. If the number of plques on B is 10 times higher than on K, and assuming that the recombination reduces the efficiency by a factor of \u221a10, then the recombination rate would be approximately 31.6%, which is not realistic. Therefore, maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, going back to the experiment: the lysogenic phage (L) kills strain B when used alone. When mixed with the lytic phage (Y), the cells that have the lysogenic mutation can take up Y and replicate without lysing. However, when treated with Y alone, those cells without the lysogenic mutation die. Therefore, the number of cells that successfully took up Y is reduced because the lytic phage Y is not effective unless combined with L.\n\nThus, the number of plques on B is determined by the fraction of cells that have the lysogenic mutation. When treated with L, those cells with the mutation survive and multiply, leading to high plques. When treated with Y, those cells with the mutation survive but do not produce Y phage because Y has a mutation that allows it to replicate regardless of the lysogenic mutation.\n\nTherefore, the number of plques on B (40) is higher than on K (4) because the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is higher on B when treated with L. The ratio of plques (40/4=10) suggests that the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is reduced by a factor of \u221a10 (~3.16).\n\nSince the recombination rate affects the likelihood of cells carrying the lysogenic mutation, the reduction in plques is proportional to the square root of the recombination fraction. Therefore, if the plques are 10 times less on K than on B, the recombination rate is \u221a(1/10)=1/\u221a10\u22480.316 or 31.6%. Again, this is too high for a recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of recombination. If the lysogenic phage (L) and the lytic phage (Y) have a recombined sequence, the phage Y now has a mutation that allows it to replicate even without the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, when treated with Y alone, the cells with the lysogenic mutation (from L) survive and multiply, but cells without the lysogenic mutation die because Y can't replicate.\n\nWhen treated with L, the lysogenic mutation allows L to replicate, but if Y has a mutation that allows it to replicate without the lysogenic mutation, then L and Y can coexist. Therefore, the number of plques on B is determined by the fraction of cells that have the lysogenic mutation, which is higher when recombination occurs.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact efficiency, it's difficult to calculate the exact recombination rate. But given that the lysogenic phage kills B when used alone, but not when mixed with Y, and that treating B with L leads to higher plques than treating with Y, the recombination likely occurs, reducing the number of cells that can take up Y.\n\nGiven the options provided, and the fact that the number of plques on B is 40 and on K is 4, which is a factor of 10 reduction, this suggests a significant reduction in the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation. The closest option to 30% is D) 0.1 percent, but that seems low. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is 10%, then the plques would decrease by a factor of 10. However, none of the options match exactly. The closest plausible answer is G) 0.5 percent, but I'm unsure.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is around 1.5%, then the plques would decrease by a factor of (\u221a1.5)^2=1.5, which would bring plques down to 26.6, but that's closer to K's 4 plques than B's 40. Hmm, not quite matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If the number of plques decreases by a factor of 10, then the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is reduced by \u221a10\u22483.16. That suggests that the recombination rate is such that only a small fraction of cells have the lysogenic mutation. The percentage of recombination would be the fraction squared. So, if the fraction is 1/3.16\u22480.316, then the recombination rate is (0.316)^2\u22480.1, which is 0.1%. That matches option D.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The recombination rate is the fraction squared. So, if the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is 1/",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli's genome splits into two halves. One half is tested against E. coli strain B, and the other against strain K. \n\nIn the first test, the E. coli strain B is plated with a half that was treated with lysogenic phage. It resulted in a saturation divided by half, meaning half of them died. Then this half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated again on strain B. Here, there were 40 plques found. On the other half, which was treated with the lytic phage, it didn't die at all, meaning no plques formed. So from this experiment alone, we know that the lysogenic phage kills E. coli strain B, while the lytic phage isn't effective here.\n\nNow, looking at the second experiment where half of the original sample is plated on strain K. This time, there were 4 plques found on K. Since strain B dies when lysogenic is present, if strain K had a mutation that somehow restores some function, maybe it could survive. However, since only 4 plques survived on K, perhaps some recombination happened between the two mutations.\n\nWait, let me think about how recombination works. Recombination means that parts of the DNA have been joined together between the two mutated genes. In phages, this would mean that the lysogenic phage has incorporated the lysogenic gene into its prophage origin DNA, along with the lysogenic mutation. So when a phage carries both a lysogenic mutation (which would kill the host if used) and a lysogenically inherited mutation (which might rescue), the combination allows the phage to replicate without killing the host.\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage killed strain B when present. If another mutation exists on the T_4 genome, such as a mutation that restores function, then when combined with the lysogenic mutation, the phage should be able to replicate without dying. Therefore, the presence of recombination would explain why some cells survived the lysogenic treatment but not the lytic one.\n\nLooking at the numbers, when the half was plated on strain B, 40 plques appeared, indicating high survival. On strain K, only 4 survived. If there was complete recombination, the number of survivors should reflect the degree of recombination. If recombination occurred, the number of surviving cells would depend on the fraction of the genome that is recombined.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating the probability of recombination between two mutations. The expected number of plques (survivors) would be proportional to the frequency of recombination. The formula is roughly plques = (R / 100)^2 * N, where R is the percentage of recombination. Wait, actually, the formula is more precise: the probability of recombination at each site is p, and the chance of having an R-locus recombinant sequence is approximately 2p(1-p) for small p. For simplicity, if the recombination rate is r%, then the expected number of plques would be (r/100)^2 times the total number of bacteria.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another approach: the number of plques depends on the number of cells that successfully replicated the phage without lysing the host. If there's complete recombination, every cell that took up the phage would have both mutations, allowing replication. But in reality, only a subset would replicate due to the nature of phage replication and selection.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plques is proportional to the efficiency of the phage infection. If there's recombination, more cells will survive, leading to higher plques. Conversely, less recombination would lead to fewer plques, but in our case, the lysogenic phage caused death, so recombination must allow the phage to survive despite the lysogenic mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the initial experiment: when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B dies. When only lytic phage is present, nothing happens. Now, when combining both, the half treated with lysogenic phage (which kills B) is now treated with both lysogenic and lytic phages? Or does each treatment use only one type?\n\nWait, the problem says the other half is treated with the lysogenic phage, which doesn't cause death, hence survives. Then that half is treated with the lytic phage, which doesn't affect it either. So in the first treatment (lysogenic only), strain B dies; in the second (lytic only), nothing happens. When both treatments are applied, the half treated with lysogenic phage (which shouldn't kill B anymore) is further treated with lytic phage. Since the phage carries both mutations, it should replicate without killing the host.\n\nTherefore, the observed outcome suggests that the lytic phage is being used to treat the lysogenic-only half, which is resistant, and vice versa. The difference is in the effectiveness of the lytic phage when used to treat the lysogenic-only half versus the lytic-only half.\n\nThe number of plques on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. Assuming that the same volume is plated, the ratio of plques would indicate the relative success rates of treating the lysogenic-only half with lysogenic vs. lytic phages. Since the lysogenic phage didn't kill B in the first treatment, but did in the second, the lytic phage worked better when used to treat the lysogenic-only half.\n\nSo the number of plques relates to the efficiency of the lytic phage when used to treat the lysogenic-only half. If the lytic phage is more effective here, it suggests that there's some recombination between the lysogenic and lytic phages' mutations.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of plques = (r/100)^2 * N\n\nWhere r is the percentage of recombination. We have 40 plques on B and 4 on K. But wait, if strain B and K have different background levels, perhaps the calculations are adjusted.

So, if recombination is high, more cells would take up the phage successfully, resulting in more plques.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage caused death in the lysogenic-only half, but not in the lytic-only half, perhaps the lytic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate even without the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, when used to treat the lysogenic-only half, it effectively selects for the cells that have the lysogenic mutation, allowing the phage to replicate without lysing the host.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the number of successful infections would correspond to the recombination fraction. So, the ratio of plques between the two treatments could give us an idea of recombination. Specifically, the number of plques on B (40) compared to K (4) might relate to the fraction of cells that have the lysogenic mutation. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Crosses) \u00d7 (100)\n\nBut I think this applies to genetic crosses between individuals. Perhaps it's better to use the following formula for estimating recombination frequency based on the number of plques:\n\nRecombination Fraction \u2248 sqrt((Plques_B + Plques_K - Total Plques)/Total Plques)\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. If the lysogenic phage (let's call it L) causes death when used alone, but becomes effective when mixed with the lytic phage (Y). Similarly, the lytic phage Y may also become effective when used with another phage. So, if recombination occurs, the lytic phage Y has a mutation that makes it effective when used with the lysogenic phage L.\n\nThis suggests that the lytic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lysing the host. Therefore, when used to treat the lysogenic-only half, it can replicate successfully, whereas when used alone, it doesn't. The number of plques on strain B (when treated with L) is 40, and on strain K (treated with Y) is 4. If recombination occurs, the fraction of cells that successfully take up the phage would depend on the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that when recombination occurs, the number of successful infections increases. Therefore, the number of plques on strain B (40) is higher than on strain K (4). To find the recombination rate, we can compare these numbers.\n\nThe formula relating plques to recombination is:\n\nPlques = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 N\n\nAssuming N is the same for both treatments, we can set up the equation:\n\n40 = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 N\n4 = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 M\n\nWhere M is the number of cells treated with Y alone. But without knowing M, we can\u2019t directly solve for r. Alternatively, taking the ratio of plques gives:\n\n40 / 4 = [(r/100)^2 \u00d7 N] / [(r/100)^2 \u00d7 M] = N/M\n\nBut again, without knowing N and M, this might not be helpful. Maybe instead, we can consider that the number of plques is proportional to the efficiency of the phage in replicating. Since the lysogenic phage (L) killed B when used alone, but allowed it to grow when mixed with Y, the presence of recombination indicates that the phage Y has a mutation that makes it effective when paired with L.\n\nPerhaps the number of plques on B is inversely related to the recombination rate. If recombination is high, the number of plques would be lower because the phage can't replicate efficiently. Given that on B we have 40 plques and on K 4, which is 10 times less, this suggests that the recombination rate is high enough to reduce the plques by a factor of 10.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nPlques_B / Plques_K = (r/100)^2\n\nSo,\n\n40 / 4 = 10 = (r/100)^2\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\u221a10 \u2248 3.16 \u2248 r/100 \u2192 r \u2248 316%\n\nWait, that can't be right because recombination rates are usually expressed as percentages of the possible combinations, which are typically around 0.5% to 1%. So, getting 316% seems impossible. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the formula. The correct formula for the number of plques when recombining is:\n\nPlques = (r/100)^2 \u00d7 N\n\nWhere N is the number of cells treated. But since both treatments involve the same number of cells (assuming they're equally dilute), the ratio of plques is equal to the ratio of (r/100)^2.\n\nGiven that on B, plques = 40, and on K, plques = 4, the ratio is 40/4 = 10. Therefore:\n\n(r/100)^2 = 10 \u2192 r/100 = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16 \u2192 r \u2248 316%\n\nAgain, this is impossible because recombination rates cannot exceed 100%. So, clearly, my assumption is incorrect. Perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of plques depends on the efficiency of the phage. The efficiency can be modeled as e = (1 - r/100), where r is the recombination rate in percent. So, plques would scale with e^2. Therefore:\n\nplques_B / plques_K = [e_B]^2 / [e_K]^2\n\nWe don't know e_B or e_K, but perhaps we can make an assumption. If the lysogenic phage (L) kills the host when used alone, then e_L = 0 (no efficiency). However, when mixed with the lytic phage (Y), e_Y > 0. So, e_Y is greater than e_L.\n\nIf the number of plques on B is much higher than on K, it suggests that e_Y is significantly higher than e_L, which aligns with the fact that recombination allows Y to replicate even without L.\n\nAssuming that the number of plques on B is proportional to e_Y^2 and on K proportional to e_K^2, and given that plques_B = 40 and plques_K = 4, the ratio is 10. So:\n\n(e_Y / e_K)^2 = 10 \u2192 e_Y / e_K = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16\n\nWhich implies that e_Y is 3.16 times higher than e_K. Since e_Y = 1 - (r_Y / 100) and similarly for e_K, and assuming that the recombination rates for L and Y are similar (both involving T_4 genome), say r_L \u2248 r_Y = r, then:\n\n(1 - (r / 100))^Y_B / (1 - (r / 100))^Y_K = \u221a10\n\nBut without knowing the actual efficiency differences, this still doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approximation is needed. If the number of plques on B is 10 times higher than on K, and assuming that the recombination reduces the efficiency by a factor of \u221a10, then the recombination rate would be approximately 31.6%, which is not realistic. Therefore, maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, going back to the experiment: the lysogenic phage (L) kills strain B when used alone. When mixed with the lytic phage (Y), the cells that have the lysogenic mutation can take up Y and replicate without lysing. However, when treated with Y alone, those cells without the lysogenic mutation die. Therefore, the number of cells that successfully took up Y is reduced because the lytic phage Y is not effective unless combined with L.\n\nThus, the number of plques on B is determined by the fraction of cells that have the lysogenic mutation. When treated with L, those cells with the mutation survive and multiply, leading to high plques. When treated with Y, those cells with the mutation survive but do not produce Y phage because Y has a mutation that allows it to replicate regardless of the lysogenic mutation.\n\nTherefore, the number of plques on B (40) is higher than on K (4) because the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is higher on B when treated with L. The ratio of plques (40/4=10) suggests that the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is reduced by a factor of \u221a10 (~3.16).\n\nSince the recombination rate affects the likelihood of cells carrying the lysogenic mutation, the reduction in plques is proportional to the square root of the recombination fraction. Therefore, if the plques are 10 times less on K than on B, the recombination rate is \u221a(1/10)=1/\u221a10\u22480.316 or 31.6%. Again, this is too high for a recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of recombination. If the lysogenic phage (L) and the lytic phage (Y) have a recombined sequence, the phage Y now has a mutation that allows it to replicate even without the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, when treated with Y alone, the cells with the lysogenic mutation (from L) survive and multiply, but cells without the lysogenic mutation die because Y can't replicate.\n\nWhen treated with L, the lysogenic mutation allows L to replicate, but if Y has a mutation that allows it to replicate without the lysogenic mutation, then L and Y can coexist. Therefore, the number of plques on B is determined by the fraction of cells that have the lysogenic mutation, which is higher when recombination occurs.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact efficiency, it's difficult to calculate the exact recombination rate. But given that the lysogenic phage kills B when used alone, but not when mixed with Y, and that treating B with L leads to higher plques than treating with Y, the recombination likely occurs, reducing the number of cells that can take up Y.\n\nGiven the options provided, and the fact that the number of plques on B is 40 and on K is 4, which is a factor of 10 reduction, this suggests a significant reduction in the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation. The closest option to 30% is D) 0.1 percent, but that seems low. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is 10%, then the plques would decrease by a factor of 10. However, none of the options match exactly. The closest plausible answer is G) 0.5 percent, but I'm unsure.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is around 1.5%, then the plques would decrease by a factor of (\u221a1.5)^2=1.5, which would bring plques down to 26.6, but that's closer to K's 4 plques than B's 40. Hmm, not quite matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If the number of plques decreases by a factor of 10, then the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is reduced by \u221a10\u22483.16. That suggests that the recombination rate is such that only a small fraction of cells have the lysogenic mutation. The percentage of recombination would be the fraction squared. So, if the fraction is 1/3.16\u22480.316, then the recombination rate is (0.316)^2\u22480.1, which is 0.1%. That matches option D.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The recombination rate is the fraction squared. So, if the fraction of cells with the lysogenic mutation is 1/",

In the first case, the phages cause a split where only the lysogenic phage affects the bacteria. Then, when plating on strain B, we see four pluses, which suggests that each bacterium has multiple plasmids.

These likely come from both wild-type and mutant plasmids. Let\u2019s say each bacterium has n plasmids. The expected number of plasmids contributing to lysogeny would be (n - r), where r is the number of recombinant plasmids per bacterium. So, the expected plasmids for lysogeny would be 40 = (m - r) * n.\n\nBut wait, maybe another approach is better. The ratio of plasmids in the two experiments can indicate the likelihood of recombination. For example, if 80% of the plasmids in the B-experiment were functional, and the same percentage applies to the K-experiment, then recombination would explain why some plasmids are lost in B but not in K.\n\nAlternatively, considering the high difference in dilution (1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5), it suggests that the loss of plasmids (due to recombination) is significant. Specifically, losing 80% of plasmids in the B-experiment would require a 90% chance of recombination, since (1 - p) = 0.8 \u2192 p = 0.2, which is 20%. But looking at the options, the closest is 2 percent (option B).\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check.

Let\u2019s assume that x% of the plasmids are lost due to recombination. \n\nIn the B-experiment, the number of plasmids per bacterium would be such that 4 pluses correspond to (1 - x/100)*m. Similarly, in the K-experiment, 40 pluses correspond to (1 - y/100)*m. But since recombination occurs once during phage infection, x and y should be related. Actually, the same recombination occurs in both experiments, so the same x applies.\n\nFrom the first experiment:\nNumber of plasmids per bacterium = m = (number of pluses)/(probability of survival)\nIf x is the fraction lost, then m = 4 / (1 - x/100)\n\nFrom the second experiment:\n40 = (m*(1 - x/100)) \u2192 40 = (4/(1 - x/100))*(1 - x/100) \u2192 40 = 4 \u2192 Which doesn't make sense.

This suggests that each mutation contributes to the outcome independently.\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the culture into two plates. One plate has a dilution of 1:10^7 and is plated on strain B's lawn. Another plate has a dilution of 1:10^5 and is plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there are four pluses on K and 40 on B. Pluses indicate successful replication or lysis, meaning the phage caused a problem.\n\nNow, I remember that recombination refers to the interaction between different alleles at the same locus. In phages, if two mutations are on the same gene, their presence might lead to independent effects, but sometimes they can cause interference. However, in this case, since only one type of phage affects the E. coli, maybe the mutations are acting separately.\n\nLet me think about how this relates to recombination. If the two mutations were on the same locus and were recombined, it could affect the fitness of the phages. For example, if one mutation makes the phage more aggressive (like lysogenic), and another makes it less effective (lytic), recombination would change the overall effect. But here, both mutations seem to have specific effects. The lysogenic phage kills E. coli, while the lytic phage doesn't. So perhaps the combination leads to either full lysogeny (both mutations present) or just lysogenicity (only lysogenic mutation).\n\nWait, the experiment shows that when both mutations are present, some cells die (lytic phage) and others don't (lysogenic). But when only lysogenic is present, all E. coli die. Similarly, when only lysic is present, all E. coli survive. So the presence of lysogenic phage alone causes death, and lysic alone causes survival. That seems contradictory unless there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nHmm, no, wait. Actually, lysogenic phages usually replicate inside the cell and integrate into the chromosome, leading to a stable phage genome. Lysogenic phages replicate outside the cell and then lyse the cell. So if you have both types, they would interfere with each other. But in this case, when lysogenic is present, E. coli dies; when lysic is present, they survive. That suggests that the lysic phage is causing the problem, regardless of the lysogenic phage. Maybe the lysic phage somehow disrupts the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate inside, making it ineffective.\n\nBut back to recombination. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact at the same locus. If they do, it could create double mutants, where neither of the original mutations is active. But in this scenario, only one mutation is seen causing issues. It seems like the mutations might be acting additively rather than interacting.\n\nAlternatively, the experiment's results suggest that the presence of both mutations leads to lethality in some cases, implying that their combined effect is lethal. But individually, they don't kill. Wait, no, actually, lysogenic phages cause death, so having both mutations would kill some cells, whereas having only lysic would allow them to live. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because lysic phages should be less harmful.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If a phage carries both mutations, it would have conflicting effects. Perhaps the lysogenic mutation (which typically doesn't lyse) causes the lysic phage to replicate inside, disrupting its own function. Or vice versa. Alternatively, the lysic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, preventing it from functioning properly.\n\nIn any case, the key point is that these two mutations don't interact to produce lethality unless both are present. So their recombination isn't affecting the lethality directly but rather their individual effects.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the presence of a recombination event between the two loci. Since the phages are on the same gene, recombination implies that the two mutations are present in the same phage copy number.\n\nIf recombination occurs, the number of recombinant phages (with both mutations) would be lower because they're fewer due to interference. Interference reduces the number of viable recombinants compared to the expected parental copies.\n\nIn this experiment, when both mutations are present, the lethality (pluses) are lower than expected. Normally, without interference, the number of recombinants would be around half the total (if they are recessive). But with interference, the number of recombinants decreases further.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, the plus count is 4, and on strain K, it's 40. The total for each plate is 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively.\n\nAssuming that without interference, the expected number of recombinants would be roughly proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let's denote p as the frequency of one mutation and q as the other. Then the expected number of recombinants would be approximately pq * N, where N is the total number of phages.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate the observed number of recombinants and compare it to the expected under independence (no interference) versus dependence (interference).\n\nFirst, calculate the expected number of recombinants under no interference. Each plate is plated at a certain dilution, so the concentration of phages is inversely related to the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means 1e-7 phages per cell. Assuming a population size of, say, 1e6 cells per plate, the total phage load is 1e6 * 1e-7 = 1 phage per plate.\n\nSo, the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is pq. Therefore, the expected number of recombinants per plate would be pq * 1 = pq.\n\nOn strain B, the number of plasmids is 1:10^7, so N_B = 1e6 / 1e7 = 0.1 phages per plate. Similarly, N_K = 1e6 / 1e5 = 10 phages per plate.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of phages on each plate depends on the dilution. For a 1:10^7 dilution, the concentration is 1e-7 phages/mL. If each plate has, say, 1 mL of media, then the number of phages per plate is 1e-7 phages/mL * 1 mL = 1e-7 phages per plate. Multiply by the number of cells, say 1e6, gives 1e-7 * 1e6 = 0.1 phages per plate.\n\nSimilarly, for a 1:10^5 dilution, the concentration is 1e-5 phages/mL. With 1 mL, that's 1e-5 phages per plate. Times 1e6 cells gives 1e-5 * 1e6 = 10 phages per plate.\n\nTherefore, the number of phages on each plate is N_B = 0.1 and N_K = 10.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants (phages with both mutations) would be N_B * N_K * pq. But since each phage has a probability pq of being a recombinant, the expectation is N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nHowever, the observed number of plasmids with both mutations is given by the counts on each plate. On strain B, 4 pluses, and on strain K, 40 pluses.\n\nPlasmids are distributed randomly among the cells, so the fraction of plasmids with both mutations is equal to the expected number. So, for strain B:\n\nNumber of plasmids with both mutations = (Expected recombinant phages) * Fraction of cells with those phages.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as:\n\nEach phage has a probability pq of being a recombinant. So, the expected number of recombinants per plate is N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nBut the actual number observed is 4 on strain B and 40 on strain K. Let's see if this matches our expectations.\n\nTotal possible phages across both plates: N_B + N_K = 0.1 + 10 = 10.1 phages.\n\nActual observed plasmids: 4 + 40 = 44.\n\nSo, the fraction of plasmids with both mutations is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%.\n\nUnder independence, the expected fraction would be pq. So, if 44 plasmids correspond to 4 recombinants, the expected fraction would be 4 / 44 \u2248 9.09%, which equals pq.\n\nThus, pq \u2248 0.0909.\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply by 100: ~9.09%. But wait, the options provided are much smaller percentages. Hmmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the calculation. Let's try again.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants is N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nWe know that the observed number is 4 on B and 40 on K, totaling 44.\n\nSo, 44 = N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nN_B is 0.1, N_K is 10, so:\n\n44 = 0.1 * 10 * pq => 44 = 1 * pq => pq = 44.\n\nWait, that can't be right because pq can't exceed 1. I must have messed up the approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each plate is independent. So for strain B, the expected number of plasmids with both mutations is pq * N_B.\n\nSimilarly, for strain K, it's pq * N_K.\n\nSo, the observed numbers are 4 and 40, which correspond to:\n\n4 = pq * N_B => 4 = pq * 0.1 => pq = 4 / 0.1 = 40.\n\n40 = pq * N_K => 40 = pq * 10 => pq = 4.\n\nThis is inconsistent because pq cannot be both 40 and 4. So clearly, my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nMaybe the correct way is to assume that the expected number of recombinants is pq multiplied by the product of the concentrations or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the expected number of recombinants is pq * min(N_B, N_K), but that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. If the expected number of recombinants is pq * N_B * N_K, and the observed number is 4 + 40 = 44.\n\nThen, 44 = pq * 0.1 * 10 => 44 = pq * 1 => pq = 44.\n\nAgain, that's impossible since probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nSo, maybe the correct formula is that the expected number of recombinants is pq * N_B + pq * N_K - pq * N_B * N_K, accounting for interference. But that still doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when multiple mutations are present, the interference reduces the number of viable recombinants. So, the observed number of plasmids with both mutations is higher than expected under independence.\n\nWait, let's try calculating the expected number of recombinants under independence. Under no interference, pq = p * q. Without considering interference, the expected number would be (p * q) * N_B * N_K.\n\nBut in reality, the number of plasmids with both mutations is 4 + 40 = 44.\n\nSo, 44 = (p * q) * 0.1 * 10 => 44 = 1 * p * q => p * q = 44.\n\nWhich is impossible because p and q are probabilities (each \u22641), so their product cannot exceed 1.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed. Maybe I should consider that each phage has a probability p of having mutation A and q of mutation B. The probability of both mutations is p*q. The expected number of such phages would be p*q*(total phages)^2.\n\nBut without interference, the variance would increase, but the expectation remains p*q*N^2, where N is the total number of phages.\n\nBut in reality, interference reduces the variance, but the expectation remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the plasmids are selected against. If the presence of both mutations is lethal, then fewer plasmids will survive. However, in this case, the lethality is observed only when both mutations are present together, but not when only one is present.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, when both mutations are present, half the cells die. When only lysogenic is present, all cells die. And when only lysic is present, most survive. So, the lethality is only when both mutations are present.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both mutations causes lethality, while the presence of either mutation allows survival. Thus, the mutation combinations are additive in terms of lethality.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination would involve the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, potentially creating recombinant phages. However, in this case, the lethality is due to the combination of two mutations, suggesting that they act additively rather than through recombination.\n\nRecombination would likely reduce the number of viable recombinant phages, thereby reducing the lethality. However, in this scenario, the lethality is already reduced by the presence of both mutations, so recombination may not play a role here.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. So, perhaps I should look for evidence of recombination in the data.\n\nSince the lethality is observed only when both mutations are present, and not when either is alone, this suggests that the mutations are acting independently. Recombination would imply that the two mutations are inherited together, thus increasing the risk of lethality when both are present. But here, the lethality is already reduced by the simultaneous presence of both mutations, indicating that recombination isn't occurring.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations\". If there's no recombination, then the mutations are independent, and the lethality wouldn't be reduced by interference. Instead, the lethality would depend solely on the sum of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut in this case, the lethality is already reduced by the presence of both mutations, suggesting that the mutations are linked, i.e., recombination occurs frequently enough to create recombinant phages that are less likely to cause lethality.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. If recombination occurs, it creates recombinant phages that are less likely to cause lethality when both mutations are present. So, the presence of recombination would reduce the lethality, even though the lethality is already reduced by the presence of both mutations.\n\nBut in the experiment, the lethality is already reduced by the presence of both mutations, so the recombination rate must be low enough to prevent the creation of many recombinant phages, which would otherwise have increased the lethality.\n\nBut the problem states that the lethality is already reduced by the simultaneous presence of both mutations. So, perhaps the recombination rate is low, meaning that few recombinant phages are produced, hence the lethality is already minimized by the presence of both mutations.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. So, if the mutations are acting independently, recombination shouldn't occur often. Conversely, if recombination occurs frequently, it would create many recombinant phages, which are less likely to cause lethality when both are present, effectively lowering the observed lethality beyond what would be expected from independent mutations.\n\nIn this case, the observed lethality is 4 out of 44 plasmids (on B) and 40 out of 44 (on K). That's about 9% lethality on B and 9% on K. If the mutations were independent, the expected lethality would be 5% (assuming each mutation has a 5% chance). However, the observed lethality is slightly higher, suggesting that there is some degree of linkage between the mutations, meaning some recombination occurs, albeit at a low rate.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, the highest is G.0.5 percent. So, perhaps the recombination rate is around 0.5%, which would explain why the lethality is slightly higher than expected for independent mutations.\n\nWait, but the question is about the amount of recombination. So, if recombination occurs at 0.5%, the expected lethality would be slightly higher than 5%, matching the observed values.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be G.0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets half-satidified, which means half of them are dead, and half are alive. This suggests that each mutation contributes to the outcome independently.\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the culture into two plates. One plate has a dilution of 1:10^7 and is plated on strain B's lawn. Another plate has a dilution of 1:10^5 and is plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there are four pluses on K and 40 on B. Pluses indicate successful replication or lysis, meaning the phage caused a problem.\n\nNow, I remember that recombination refers to the interaction between different alleles at the same locus. In phages, if two mutations are on the same gene, their presence might lead to independent effects, but sometimes they can cause interference. However, in this case, since only one type of phage affects the E. coli, maybe the mutations are acting separately.\n\nLet me think about how this relates to recombination. If the two mutations were on the same locus and were recombined, it could affect the fitness of the phages. For example, if one mutation makes the phage more aggressive (like lysogenic), and another makes it less effective (lytic), recombination would change the overall effect. But here, both mutations seem to have specific effects. The lysogenic phage kills E. coli, while the lytic phage doesn't. So perhaps the combination leads to either full lysogeny (both mutations present) or just lysogenicity (only lysogenic mutation).\n\nWait, the experiment shows that when both mutations are present, some cells die (lytic phage) and others don't (lysogenic). But when only lysogenic is present, all E. coli die. Similarly, when only lysic is present, all E. coli survive. So the presence of lysogenic phage alone causes death, and lysic alone causes survival. That seems contradictory unless there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nHmm, no, wait. Actually, lysogenic phages usually replicate inside the cell and integrate into the chromosome, leading to a stable phage genome. Lysogenic phages replicate outside the cell and then lyse the cell. So if you have both types, they would interfere with each other. But in this case, when lysogenic is present, E. coli dies; when lysic is present, they survive. That suggests that the lysic phage is causing the problem, regardless of the lysogenic phage. Maybe the lysic phage somehow disrupts the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate inside, making it ineffective.\n\nBut back to recombination. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact at the same locus. If they do, it could create double mutants, where neither of the original mutations is active. But in this scenario, only one mutation is seen causing issues. It seems like the mutations might be acting additively rather than interacting.\n\nAlternatively, the experiment's results suggest that the presence of both mutations leads to lethality in some cases, implying that their combined effect is lethal. But individually, they don't kill. Wait, no, actually, lysogenic phages cause death, so having both mutations would kill some cells, whereas having only lysic would allow them to live. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because lysic phages should be less harmful.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If a phage carries both mutations, it would have conflicting effects. Perhaps the lysogenic mutation (which typically doesn't lyse) causes the lysic phage to replicate inside, disrupting its own function. Or vice versa. Alternatively, the lysic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, preventing it from functioning properly.\n\nIn any case, the key point is that these two mutations don't interact to produce lethality unless both are present. So their recombination isn't affecting the lethality directly but rather their individual effects.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the presence of a recombination event between the two loci. Since the phages are on the same gene, recombination implies that the two mutations are present in the same phage copy number.\n\nIf recombination occurs, the number of recombinant phages (with both mutations) would be lower because they're fewer due to interference. Interference reduces the number of viable recombinants compared to the expected parental copies.\n\nIn this experiment, when both mutations are present, the lethality (pluses) are lower than expected. Normally, without interference, the number of recombinants would be around half the total (if they are recessive). But with interference, the number of recombinants decreases further.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, the plus count is 4, and on strain K, it's 40. The total for each plate is 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively.\n\nAssuming that without interference, the expected number of recombinants would be roughly proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let's denote p as the frequency of one mutation and q as the other. Then the expected number of recombinants would be approximately pq * N, where N is the total number of phages.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate the observed number of recombinants and compare it to the expected under independence (no interference) versus dependence (interference).\n\nFirst, calculate the expected number of recombinants under no interference. Each plate is plated at a certain dilution, so the concentration of phages is inversely related to the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means 1e-7 phages per cell. Assuming a population size of, say, 1e6 cells per plate, the total phage load is 1e6 * 1e-7 = 1 phage per plate.\n\nSo, the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is pq. Therefore, the expected number of recombinants per plate would be pq * 1 = pq.\n\nOn strain B, the number of plasmids is 1:10^7, so N_B = 1e6 / 1e7 = 0.1 phages per plate. Similarly, N_K = 1e6 / 1e5 = 10 phages per plate.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of phages on each plate depends on the dilution. For a 1:10^7 dilution, the concentration is 1e-7 phages/mL. If each plate has, say, 1 mL of media, then the number of phages per plate is 1e-7 phages/mL * 1 mL = 1e-7 phages per plate. Multiply by the number of cells, say 1e6, gives 1e-7 * 1e6 = 0.1 phages per plate.\n\nSimilarly, for a 1:10^5 dilution, the concentration is 1e-5 phages/mL. With 1 mL, that's 1e-5 phages per plate. Times 1e6 cells gives 1e-5 * 1e6 = 10 phages per plate.\n\nTherefore, the number of phages on each plate is N_B = 0.1 and N_K = 10.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants (phages with both mutations) would be N_B * N_K * pq. But since each phage has a probability pq of being a recombinant, the expectation is N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nHowever, the observed number of plasmids with both mutations is given by the counts on each plate. On strain B, 4 pluses, and on strain K, 40 pluses.\n\nPlasmids are distributed randomly among the cells, so the fraction of plasmids with both mutations is equal to the expected number. So, for strain B:\n\nNumber of plasmids with both mutations = (Expected recombinant phages) * Fraction of cells with those phages.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as:\n\nEach phage has a probability pq of being a recombinant. So, the expected number of recombinants per plate is N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nBut the actual number observed is 4 on strain B and 40 on strain K. Let's see if this matches our expectations.\n\nTotal possible phages across both plates: N_B + N_K = 0.1 + 10 = 10.1 phages.\n\nActual observed plasmids: 4 + 40 = 44.\n\nSo, the fraction of plasmids with both mutations is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%.\n\nUnder independence, the expected fraction would be pq. So, if 44 plasmids correspond to 4 recombinants, the expected fraction would be 4 / 44 \u2248 9.09%, which equals pq.\n\nThus, pq \u2248 0.0909.\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply by 100: ~9.09%. But wait, the options provided are much smaller percentages. Hmmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the calculation. Let's try again.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants is N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nWe know that the observed number is 4 on B and 40 on K, totaling 44.\n\nSo, 44 = N_B * N_K * pq.\n\nN_B is 0.1, N_K is 10, so:\n\n44 = 0.1 * 10 * pq => 44 = 1 * pq => pq = 44.\n\nWait, that can't be right because pq can't exceed 1. I must have messed up the approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each plate is independent. So for strain B, the expected number of plasmids with both mutations is pq * N_B.\n\nSimilarly, for strain K, it's pq * N_K.\n\nSo, the observed numbers are 4 and 40, which correspond to:\n\n4 = pq * N_B => 4 = pq * 0.1 => pq = 4 / 0.1 = 40.\n\n40 = pq * N_K => 40 = pq * 10 => pq = 4.\n\nThis is inconsistent because pq cannot be both 40 and 4. So clearly, my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nMaybe the correct way is to assume that the expected number of recombinants is pq multiplied by the product of the concentrations or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the expected number of recombinants is pq * min(N_B, N_K), but that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. If the expected number of recombinants is pq * N_B * N_K, and the observed number is 4 + 40 = 44.\n\nThen, 44 = pq * 0.1 * 10 => 44 = pq * 1 => pq = 44.\n\nAgain, that's impossible since probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nSo, maybe the correct formula is that the expected number of recombinants is pq * N_B + pq * N_K - pq * N_B * N_K, accounting for interference. But that still doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when multiple mutations are present, the interference reduces the number of viable recombinants. So, the observed number of plasmids with both mutations is higher than expected under independence.\n\nWait, let's try calculating the expected number of recombinants under independence. Under no interference, pq = p * q. Without considering interference, the expected number would be (p * q) * N_B * N_K.\n\nBut in reality, the number of plasmids with both mutations is 4 + 40 = 44.\n\nSo, 44 = (p * q) * 0.1 * 10 => 44 = 1 * p * q => p * q = 44.\n\nWhich is impossible because p and q are probabilities (each \u22641), so their product cannot exceed 1.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed. Maybe I should consider that each phage has a probability p of having mutation A and q of mutation B. The probability of both mutations is p*q. The expected number of such phages would be p*q*(total phages)^2.\n\nBut without interference, the variance would increase, but the expectation remains p*q*N^2, where N is the total number of phages.\n\nBut in reality, interference reduces the variance, but the expectation remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the plasmids are selected against. If the presence of both mutations is lethal, then fewer plasmids will survive. However, in this case, the lethality is observed only when both mutations are present together, but not when only one is present.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, when both mutations are present, half the cells die. When only lysogenic is present, all cells die. And when only lysic is present, most survive. So, the lethality is only when both mutations are present.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both mutations causes lethality, while the presence of either mutation allows survival.

The lysogenic phage affects E. coli B, while the lytic phage might affect others if there's an active lysogen. So, perhaps both are present, leading to some mixture.\n\n2. **Splitting Phase**: After infection, the cells divide into two. One half goes to strain B's lawn, and the other to strain K's lawn. The key here is that the half going to strain K was more likely to be successful because strain B isn't as affected by the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since strain B is already under the influence of the lysogenic phage, maybe the half going to strain K didn't get the lysogenic phage, whereas the half going to strain B did. So the half on B's lawn was exposed to both phages? Or just the lysogenic?\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If both mutation types are present, then for the half on strain B's lawn, the lysogenic phage from the other half (from the parent batch?) would have crossed over, causing some expression of the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, the half on strain K's lawn would have been treated without any mutation, or at least less susceptible to the lysogenic phage.\n\nSo, during the experiment, the half on strain B's lawn was exposed to both phages: the original lysogenic phage (which caused lysis) and the new lysogenic phage (mutated), possibly due to crossing over. Whereas the half on strain K's lawn wasn't exposed to either phage, assuming strain K has a different mutation or none.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the two types of mutantphages are simultaneously present, meaning both types are cross-overing, right? Because during replication, the phage's genes would cause crossing over between homologous chromosomes, producing mutated versions.\n\nNow, when the half on strain B's lawn is plated, it's exposed to both phages. The lysogenic phage from the other half (original mutation type) crosses over and introduces its own mutation. The lysogenic phage from the current half (mutant type) also crosses over, introducing another mutation. This could lead to double mutants.\n\nSimilarly, the half on strain K's lawn is not exposed to any mutation, so it should survive unless the lysogenic phage from the other half (original mutation type) somehow crosses over and introduced a mutation. Wait, no\u2014strain K is presumably without the mutation, so if the other half had a mutation, it might still introduce one upon replication.\n\nBut in reality, each half of the phage population will undergo replication independently. So, the half on strain B's lawn is subjected to both phages, leading to possible double mutation. The half on strain K's lawn is subjected to only the lysogenic phage from the other half, which may or may not have introduced a mutation.\n\nHowever, in the experiment, both strains show some plumes. On strain B, 40 plumes were found, which suggests high activity; on strain K, 4 plumes. That indicates that the strain K half was more resistant, meaning that the lysogenic phage from the other half probably introduced a mutation on strain K's lawn, making it more susceptible than normal.\n\nBut the main point is about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosome pairs during replication. In the case of two-point mapping, recombination frequency (RF) is calculated based on the parental and recombinant phenotypes.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage from the other half (parental mutation type) crosses over and introduces its own mutation, and the mutant phage from the current half crosses over and introduces a second mutation, these two mutations are linked on the same chromosome. Therefore, the distance between them determines the RF.\n\nTo calculate RF, we use the formula:\n\nRF = (number of recombinants / total number of testcrosses)\n\nBut in this context, the plumes indicate the number of successful infections. However, the exact calculation might be more complex. Alternatively, we can estimate the probability of recombination based on the observed distribution.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are located close together, the RF can be estimated using the ratio of recombinant to parental cases. For example, if in a testcross, 80% of the offspring are recombinants, then RF is 80%.\n\nAlternatively, the RF can be approximated by the percentage of double mutations. If the correct answer is D, 0.05%, that suggests a very low recombination rate, indicating that the two mutations are very close together.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest RF mentioned is H at 5%. Lower RF values correspond to closer linkage.

Wait, no\u2014strain K is presumably without the mutation, so if the other half had a mutation, it might still introduce one upon replication.\n\nBut in reality, each half of the phage population will undergo replication independently. So, the half on strain B's lawn is subjected to both phages, leading to possible double mutation. The half on strain K's lawn is subjected to only the lysogenic phage from the other half, which may or may not have introduced a mutation.\n\nHowever, in the experiment, both strains show some plumes. On strain B, 40 plumes were found, which suggests high activity; on strain K, 4 plumes. That indicates that the strain K half was more resistant, meaning that the lysogenic phage from the other half probably introduced a mutation on strain K's lawn, making it more susceptible than normal.\n\nBut the main point is about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosome pairs during replication. In the case of two-point mapping, recombination frequency (RF) is calculated based on the parental and recombinant phenotypes.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage from the other half (parental mutation type) crosses over and introduces its own mutation, and the mutant phage from the current half crosses over and introduces a second mutation, these two mutations are linked on the same chromosome. Therefore, the distance between them determines the RF.\n\nTo calculate RF, we use the formula:\n\nRF = (number of recombinants / total number of testcrosses)\n\nBut in this context, the plumes indicate the number of successful infections. However, the exact calculation might be more complex. Alternatively, we can estimate the probability of recombination based on the observed distribution.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are located close together, the RF can be estimated using the ratio of recombinant to parental cases. For example, if in a testcross, 80% of the offspring are recombinants, then RF is 80%.\n\nAlternatively, the RF can be approximated by the percentage of double mutations. If the correct answer is D, 0.05%, that suggests a very low recombination rate, indicating that the two mutations are very close together.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest RF mentioned is H at 5%. Lower RF values correspond to closer linkage. Since the question asks for the amount of recombination, and considering typical bacterial linkage distances, a low RF like 0.05% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

If there's complete recombination (like 0% or 100%), the phages would be non-specifically integrating without any specific selection pressure, leading to more random coexistence. But if there's no recombination, maybe the phages act as specific integrators, causing lytic fission regardless of whether they integrate.\n\nWait, the experiment shows that when both phages are present, only some bacteria die. So in the first dilution, most should still survive. In the second dilution, only some should die. That suggests that when both phages are present, their activity affects different subsets of cells.\n\nI think the formula for calculating the number of plumes is related to the square root of the dilution factor. For example, at a dilution of 1:10^n, the expected number of plumes is sqrt(n). Because the number of possible combinations increases with n.\n\nSo let's apply that.

Since the first dilution has higher dilution, the number of plumes is lower. Let's say R is the recombination rate. If R is high, the two phages are similar, so they might cause less independent action, thus reducing the number of plumes compared to a situation where each phage acts independently.\n\nWait, another approach: when both phages are present, the combined effect determines the number of plumes. If the phages are completely recombined, they don't interfere much, so the number of plumes would be similar to what would happen if only one type exists. If there's no recombination, the two phages might cause more interference, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nIn the problem, during the second dilution (1:10^5), four plumes were found on strain K. On the first dilution (1:10^7), how many plumes would occur? Well, under complete recombination, the two phages wouldn't affect each other much, so the number of plumes would depend on whether each phage individually would cause issues.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected number of plumes in each dilution assuming no recombination versus full recombination.\n\nUnder no recombination, the two phages would act independently. So the number of plumes would be the sum of the individual plume counts minus any overlapping effects, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the number of plumes from two phages with r% recombination can be approximated by the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = sqrt(n1 * n2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the dilution factors. But I'm not sure about the exact formula here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the fact that the ratio of plumes between the two dilutions relates to the square of the recombination rate.

Then the other half are diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. From this, we have four plques on K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that in recombinant DNA experiments, when two genes are linked, you expect a certain number of recombinant chromosomes. Each time you dilute, the chance of getting a recombinant chromosome decreases exponentially. So the more dilutions, the fewer recombinations you'd see.\n\nIn this case, the initial dilution is 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K. So the ratio is about 1:100. If there was no recombination, the expected number of recombinants should be very low. However, since some recombinants are happening, we can estimate how much recombination has occurred.\n\nThe formula I think is used here is something like (number of recombinants) = (total number of colonies) * (probability per chromosome) * (dilution factor)^n, where n is the number of times each colony was replicated or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the probability of recombination at each step.\n\nLet me try another approach. The expected number of recombinants is calculated using the product of the dilution factors raised to the power of the number of times each sample was plated. Since each sample is half the previous, perhaps the formula involves (dilution factor)^n, where n is the number of times each sample was plated.\n\nWait, the problem states that half the colonies were plated on B and the other half on K. So each of those halves was further diluted. The first dilution for B was 1:10^7, and then each subsequent sample was diluted by multiplying by 10 each time. Similarly for K, starting at 1:10^5.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expectation would be minimal. But since we're seeing some plques, let's calculate the expected recombinants. The total number of plques observed is 4 + 40 = 44. \n\nEach sample had half the original, so if the total is 44, each half would contribute about 22 plques. Now, the expected number under no recombination would be (number of plques from B) * (plque density). Plue density depends on the dilution factor.\n\nFor B: Starting at 1:10^7, the density would be 1/(10^7), so 1e-7. For K: 1/10^5 = 1e-5. Assuming equal numbers of plques from each dilution, the expected recombinants would be (22 * 1e-7) + (22 * 1e-5). That's approximately 2.2e-6 + 2.2e-4 \u2248 0.0022, which is around 0.22% of the total. Hmm, but the options don't go up to 0.3%. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a multiplier somewhere.\n\nAnother way: The expected number of recombinants is given by N = (n1 * n2) * p, where n1 and n2 are the dilution factors, and p is the probability of recombination at each step. But actually, the formula is (n1 * n2) * (p)^(k), where k is the number of steps. Wait, perhaps it's simpler: the probability of recombination occurring once is (n1 * n2) * p, where p is the probability of recombination at each event. But without knowing p, maybe it's easier to use the formula:\n\nExpected recombinants = (number of plques) * (dilution factor)^n / (number of possible combinations)\n\nBut I might be overcomplicating. Maybe a better approach is to consider that each recombination creates a unique chromosome. The number of recombinants observed is inversely proportional to the square of the dilution factor. Given that the expected number of recombinants is 44, and considering the dilution factors involved, we can set up an equation.\n\nAlternatively, since the experiment showed that when both phages are present, the colonies are halved each time, indicating some recombination. The formula for the expected number of recombinant plques is (total plques) / (dilution factor). Here, the total plques are 44, and the overall dilution is 10^5 (since each half was diluted 1:10^5). So the expected recombinants would be 44 / 1e5 = 0.00044, which is 0.044%, but that's not matching any option exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's calculated differently. The expected number of recombinants is (number of plques) * (dilution factor)^n, where n is the number of pludes. But I'm not sure. Another thought: the ratio of plques on B to K is 4:40=1:10. Since the initial dilution was 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K, the plques would be scaled accordingly. So if the expected recombinants follow a geometric progression with the dilution factors, we can model it as:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the expected number of recombinants follows (dilution factor B)^a * (dilution factor K)^b = expected number.\n\nGiven that the expected recombinants are 0.0022 (from earlier calculation), and the dilution factors are 1e-7 and 1e-5, we can solve for a and b such that (1e-7)^a * (1e-5)^b = 0.0022.\n\nTaking logarithms: -7a -5b = ln(0.0022) \u2248 -6.197.\n\nWe need additional information to find a and b. Alternatively, since the recombination occurs once, maybe a=1 and b=1, leading to (1e-7)*(1e-5)=1e-12, which is too small. Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the ratio of plques is 4:40=1:10. Since the initial dilution was 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, the plques should scale as (10^7)^a*(10^5)^b=10^{7a+5b}. We have 1/10 = 10^{-1} = 10^{7a+5b}, so 7a +5b=-1.\n\nAssuming a=1 and b=1 gives 7+5=12\u2260-1. Not working. Alternatively, a= -1 and b= (-1)/5 \u2192 -1 -0.2= -1.2\u2192 10^{-1.2}= approx 0.063, which isn't 0.1. Closest option is F:0.3%.\n\nAlternatively, if a= -0.1 and b= -0.02 \u2192 sum\u2248-0.12, 10^{-0.12}= ~0.758, still not matching.\n\nMaybe it's better to look at the options provided. The possible answers are percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 0.5%. The most plausible answer based on the calculations seems to be F:0.3%.\n\nSo I'll choose F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the probability of recombination at each step.\n\nLet me try another approach. The expected number of recombinants is calculated using the product of the dilution factors raised to the power of the number of times each sample was plated. Since each sample is half the previous, perhaps the formula involves (dilution factor)^n, where n is the number of times each sample was plated.\n\nWait, the problem states that half the colonies were plated on B and the other half on K. So each of those halves was further diluted. The first dilution for B was 1:10^7, and then each subsequent sample was diluted by multiplying by 10 each time. Similarly for K, starting at 1:10^5.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expectation would be minimal. But since we're seeing some plques, let's calculate the expected recombinants. The total number of plques observed is 4 + 40 = 44. \n\nEach sample had half the original, so if the total is 44, each half would contribute about 22 plques. Now, the expected number under no recombination would be (number of plques from B) * (plque density). Plue density depends on the dilution factor.\n\nFor B: Starting at 1:10^7, the density would be 1/(10^7), so 1e-7. For K: 1/10^5 = 1e-5. Assuming equal numbers of plques from each dilution, the expected recombinants would be (22 * 1e-7) + (22 * 1e-5). That's approximately 2.2e-6 + 2.2e-4 \u2248 0.0022, which is around 0.22% of the total. Hmm, but the options don't go up to 0.3%. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a multiplier somewhere.\n\nAnother way: The expected number of recombinants is given by N = (n1 * n2) * p, where n1 and n2 are the dilution factors, and p is the probability of recombination at each step. But actually, the formula is (n1 * n2) * (p)^(k), where k is the number of steps. Wait, perhaps it's simpler: the probability of recombination occurring once is (n1 * n2) * p, where p is the probability of recombination at each event. But without knowing p, maybe it's easier to use the formula:\n\nExpected recombinants = (number of plques) * (dilution factor)^n / (number of possible combinations)\n\nBut I might be overcomplicating. Maybe a better approach is to consider that each recombination creates a unique chromosome. The number of recombinants observed is inversely proportional to the square of the dilution factor. Given that the expected number of recombinants is 44, and considering the dilution factors involved, we can set up an equation.\n\nAlternatively, since the experiment showed that when both phages are present, the colonies are halved each time, indicating some recombination. The formula for the expected number of recombinant plques is (total plques) / (dilution factor). Here, the total plques are 44, and the overall dilution is 10^5 (since each half was diluted 1:10^5). So the expected recombinants would be 44 / 1e5 = 0.00044, which is 0.044%, but that's not matching any option exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's calculated differently. The expected number of recombinants is (number of plques) * (dilution factor)^n, where n is the number of pludes. But I'm not sure. Another thought: the ratio of plques on B to K is 4:40=1:10. Since the initial dilution was 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K, the plques would be scaled accordingly. So if the expected recombinants follow a geometric progression with the dilution factors, we can model it as:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the expected number of recombinants follows (dilution factor B)^a * (dilution factor K)^b = expected number.\n\nGiven that the expected recombinants are 0.0022 (from earlier calculation), and the dilution factors are 1e-7 and 1e-5, we can solve for a and b such that (1e-7)^a * (1e-5)^b = 0.0022.\n\nTaking logarithms: -7a -5b = ln(0.0022) \u2248 -6.197.\n\nWe need additional information to find a and b. Alternatively, since the recombination occurs once, maybe a=1 and b=1, leading to (1e-7)*(1e-5)=1e-12, which is too small. Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the ratio of plques is 4:40=1:10. Since the initial dilution was 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, the plques should scale as (10^7)^a*(10^5)^b=10^{7a+5b}. We have 1/10 = 10^{-1} = 10^{7a+5b}, so 7a +5b=-1.\n\nAssuming a=1 and b=1 gives 7+5=12\u2260-1. Not working. Alternatively, a= -1 and b= (-1)/5 \u2192 -1 -0.2= -1.2\u2192 10^{-1.2}= approx 0.063, which isn't 0.1. Closest option is F:0.3%.\n\nAlternatively, if a= -0.1 and b= -0.02 \u2192 sum\u2248-0.12, 10^{-0.12}= ~0.758, still not matching.\n\nMaybe it's better to look at the options provided. The possible answers are percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 0.5%. The most plausible answer based on the calculations seems to be F:0.3%.\n\nSo I'll choose F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Then, when you dilute by D1=1e7 and D2=1e5, the expected plques would be proportional to s1*D1 and s2*D2 respectively.

Strain K probably has a normal phage type, so if both mutants are present, only the lysogenic phage (which causes lytic fission) kills strain B, but the wild-type phage (since it's not mutated) should kill strain K normally. But in reality, since both mutant types are present, only strain B dies because the lysogenic phage is active, whereas strain K remains unaffected? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes under normal conditions without any recombination. Without any recombination, all the lysogenic phage should be present, so all cells would die except those with the wild-type phage. But in our case, some cells died (strange phage was active), others didn't. Maybe this indicates that the mutations are in different regions or on different chromosomes.\n\nThe key here is determining how many of the cells were affected by the mutation(s) in each strain. For strain B, which only shows division due to the lysogenic phage, we expect fewer plumes than if both strains had mutations. For strain K, which doesn't show such division, we'd expect more plumes from the lysogenic phage.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, after dilution, the number of plumes depends on the probability that the lysogenic phage caused the division. If there's recombination, then some cells will have the mutation in one phage and the wild-type in the other, meaning some cells will survive despite the lysogenic phage's activity.\n\nSo, when both mutantphages are present, the number of plumes observed in the strain B (diluted 1:1e7) would indicate how many cells survived, meaning the lysogenic phage did not kill them. Similarly, in the strain K sample, the higher number of plumes (40 vs. 4) suggests that the lysogenic phage killed more cells here.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities. For strain B, the probability that a cell survives is p = 4/(total cells plated * dilution factor). Since the total cells are 1e7 + 1e5, approximately 1e7, the survival rate p \u2248 4 / (1e7 * 1e7) = 4e-15.

For strain B, the probability that a cell survives is p = 4/(total cells plated * dilution factor).

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, which has 40 pluses. So, the number of pluses tells us about the likelihood of recombination between the two mutants. \n\nThe formula for calculating recombinant frequency is (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%. In this case, the total offspring would be the sum of the two groups: 4 + 40 = 44. The number of recombinants is 4. \n\nSo, 4/44 equals approximately 0.0909 or 9.09%, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the dilution factors affect how many offspring there are. Let's think again. If we take a sample from each group and plate them on different backgrounds, the dilution affects the number of potential plasmids available. \n\nIn the first group, they're plated on strain B, so any plasmids would come from their own replication. But if some cells have both mutants, then upon lysis, they could produce more phage particles with either mutation. However, since only lysogenic phage affected strain B, maybe the ones with both mutations wouldn't cause issues. \n\nWait, no. The problem states that only the lysogenic phage caused the split in strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage that didn't cause lytic fission still had the mutation. So, when they were plated on strain K, these plasmids might now integrate into K's phage genome, causing recombination. \n\nBut how does the dilution factor play into this? Each group was plated at different dilutions. The first group was plated on 1:10^7, so each cell represents 1e-7 of the original culture. The second was 1:10^5, which is more concentrated. This means that in the second group, there are fewer cells, so potentially more recombinant offspring since the same number of plasmids might be present in less dilute media. \n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids per cell. If the phages carry one mutation each, then each cell contributes two plasmid copies. But wait, actually, each phage carries one copy of each mutation. Since the phages are mutant, they have both mutations. So when they replicate, they can pass either mutation to daughter cells during division. \n\nIf a cell has both mutations, then during replication, each daughter cell will inherit one mutation. After lysis, these daughter cells could contain one mutated phage particle. However, since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it survives. Therefore, in strain B, which was treated with lysogenic phage, these daughter phage particles would lead to cell death, as they don't lyse the E. coli. \n\nWhen the cells are plated on strain K, if some of them lost their mutation due to recombination, the daughter phages would carry a mix of the two mutations. If enough of these plasmids integrated into K's phage genome, they might be expressed, leading to new phages that lyse the E. coli, thus preventing the split in strain K. \n\nNow, looking back at the data: 4 pluses on strain B and 40 on strain K. Total plasmids would be 44, as before. The expected recombinant frequency would depend on how much recombination occurred. If the experiment shows that 4 out of 44 cells lost their mutation, that suggests significant recombination. \n\nUsing the formula: Recombinant Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals) * 100% = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9.09%. That's way higher than any of the given options. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach considers the dilution effect. \n\nAnother approach: The probability that a cell retains its mutation is inversely related to the dilution. For example, if you dilute the media, the chance of having the mutation increases. If in the first group, you have a lower dilution, say 1:10^7, the chance of losing the mutation is higher. Similarly, in the second group, a higher dilution allows for more chances of recombination. \n\nLet\u2019s model it: Suppose in the first group, each cell has a certain proportion of the plasmid carrying the mutation. After being plated on strain B, cells without the mutation replicate and produce phages with both mutations, which lyse E. coli. Cells with the mutation replicate and produce phages with one mutation, which don\u2019t lyse E. coli. \n\nWhen plated on strain K, cells with the mutation may lose it via recombination. The number of plasmids transferred depends on the dilution. The dilution factor (DF) determines the probability of losing the mutation. DF = 1/(number of plasmids per cell). \n\nAssuming each cell has two plasmid copies (one from each mutation), DF = 1/2. So, in a DF of 1:10^7, the chance of losing a mutation is 1 - (1 - 1/2)^n, where n is the number of plasmids replicated. Wait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, using the formula for the expected number of recombinants: (DF^2) * N, where DF is the dilution fraction and N is the total number of cells. \n\nBut I'm getting too deep into calculations. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C, 1.5 percent, but my initial calculation suggested around 9 percent. Maybe I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, the problem might involve the interference between mutations, but that's usually negligible unless high recombination rates are observed. \n\nGiven the data, the most likely option is D, 0.05 percent, but my initial calculation points towards ~9%, which isn't among the choices. Perhaps the correct approach uses the ratio of recombinant to total plasmids. Let's see: 4 plasmids out of 44 possible. 4/44 = 0.0909, which is roughly 9.1%, but none of the options match. Alternatively, considering that the two treatments (strains B and K) each contribute to the overall rate. \n\nWait, another thought: If 4 plasmids are lost in the first treatment (strain B) and 40 in the second (strain K), perhaps the total recombinant plasmids are 4 + 40 = 44, giving a frequency of 4/44, which is about 9%. But the options don't include 9%. Maybe I should look for an alternative interpretation. \n\nPerhaps the correct method is to calculate the expected recombination frequency using the observed data. Using the formula:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (R) / (R + U)\n\nWhere R is the number of recombinant offspring and U is the number of unrecombinant. Here, R = 4, U = 40, total = 44.\n\nThus, F = 4 / 44 \u2248 0.0909, or 9.09%. None of the options match. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids is the key. If each cell produces two plasmids (each from a mutation), then the total number of plasmids in each group is proportional to the dilution. For example, in the first group, 1:10^7 dilution means that each cell represents 1e-7 of the original culture, implying that the plasmids per cell are higher, reducing the chance of loss. Conversely, in the second group, 1:10^5 dilution leads to more plasmids per cell, increasing the chance of recombination. \n\nCalculating the expected recombinant frequency: Since the dilution factors differ, the probabilities adjust. The expected recombinant plasmids per cell would be proportional to the dilution fraction squared. So, DF1 = 1e-7, DF2 = 1e-5. Expected recombinant plasmids per cell would be DF1^2 + DF2^2 = (1e-14) + (1e-10) = negligible. Wait, that can't be right. \n\nMaybe the correct formula is (DF1 * DF2) * N, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the frequency is calculated as (DF1 * DF2) / (1 + DF1 * DF2). With DF1=1e-7 and DF2=1e-5, DF1*DF2=1e-12, which is very small. Thus, the recombinant frequency would be almost zero, which isn't matching the options either. \n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try another angle. The number of plasmids lost in each group. In the first group, 4 plasmids lost out of 44 possible (if all cells had two plasmids). So, 4/44\u22489%. But the options don't have 9%. The closest is G, 0.5%, but that seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation involves the dilution effects differently. \n\nWait, another possibility: The number of plasmids lost is 4 in the first group and 40 in the second. Total plasmids lost = 44. Assuming each cell loses plasmids independently, the probability of losing a mutation is (1 - (1 - p)^n), where p is the probability of losing a single plasmid, and n is the number of times it's replicated. But without knowing n, it's hard to proceed. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll go with the initial calculation of ~9%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D, 0.05 percent, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H, 5 percent, but why? Or perhaps I should reconsider the experimental design. \n\nWait, in the first group, the cells are plated on strain B, which already has the lysogenic phage. Any plasmids lost here would mean that the cells can't replicate the lysogenic phage, leading to cell death. When these cells are plated on strain K, any plasmids lost during replication would transfer to the daughter cells, which could integrate into K's genome, allowing them to express the lysogenic phage and lyse E. coli. \n\nTherefore, the number of recombinant plasmids would determine how many cells survive. The number of surviving cells would be proportional to the number of plasmids retained plus the number lost that integrates into K's genome. \n\nThis complicates things further. Without specific data on how many plasmids were lost, it's challenging to compute precisely. Given the options, I might infer that the correct answer is C, 1.5 percent, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the expected recombination frequency based on the number of plasmids lost. \n\nAfter struggling, I think the intended answer is D, 0.05 percent, but I'm not entirely sure.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets halved\u2014so maybe some die and some replicate? \n\nThen, half of those cells are diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a strain B lawn, where 4 pluses are found. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, which has 40 pluses. So, the number of pluses tells us about the likelihood of recombination between the two mutants. \n\nThe formula for calculating recombinant frequency is (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%. In this case, the total offspring would be the sum of the two groups: 4 + 40 = 44. The number of recombinants is 4. \n\nSo, 4/44 equals approximately 0.0909 or 9.09%, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the dilution factors affect how many offspring there are. Let's think again. If we take a sample from each group and plate them on different backgrounds, the dilution affects the number of potential plasmids available. \n\nIn the first group, they're plated on strain B, so any plasmids would come from their own replication. But if some cells have both mutants, then upon lysis, they could produce more phage particles with either mutation. However, since only lysogenic phage affected strain B, maybe the ones with both mutations wouldn't cause issues. \n\nWait, no. The problem states that only the lysogenic phage caused the split in strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage that didn't cause lytic fission still had the mutation. So, when they were plated on strain K, these plasmids might now integrate into K's phage genome, causing recombination. \n\nBut how does the dilution factor play into this? Each group was plated at different dilutions. The first group was plated on 1:10^7, so each cell represents 1e-7 of the original culture. The second was 1:10^5, which is more concentrated. This means that in the second group, there are fewer cells, so potentially more recombinant offspring since the same number of plasmids might be present in less dilute media. \n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids per cell. If the phages carry one mutation each, then each cell contributes two plasmid copies. But wait, actually, each phage carries one copy of each mutation. Since the phages are mutant, they have both mutations. So when they replicate, they can pass either mutation to daughter cells during division. \n\nIf a cell has both mutations, then during replication, each daughter cell will inherit one mutation. After lysis, these daughter cells could contain one mutated phage particle. However, since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it survives. Therefore, in strain B, which was treated with lysogenic phage, these daughter phage particles would lead to cell death, as they don't lyse the E. coli. \n\nWhen the cells are plated on strain K, if some of them lost their mutation due to recombination, the daughter phages would carry a mix of the two mutations.

If the experiment shows that 4 out of 44 cells lost their mutation, that suggests significant recombination. \n\nUsing the formula: Recombinant Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals) * 100% = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9.09%.

The second half (strain K) is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? Dilution affects the likelihood of plating. If you dilute too much, fewer plasmids replicate, making it harder to get enough copies to lyse or infect. So if the phages are more common in the culture, more plasmids replicate, increasing the chance of lysing or infecting.\n\nIn this case, the E. coli strain B was treated with both mutant types. Since only the lysogenic phage did damage, some plasmids must have been lost during replication. When they're plated on strain B's lawn, those plasmids don't cause issues because the lysogenic phage isn't present anymore. However, when the same plasmid-free DNA is plated on strain K's lawn, the lysogenic phage might be able to replicate and infect, leading to more plasmids replicating and causing more damage.\n\nWait, but why are there more plasmids on K than on B? Maybe because the lysogenic phage is still present, so even without being detected, it can cause replication. Or perhaps the initial replication at low dilution rates allows for some plasmids to survive. \n\nThe key here is figuring out how many recombined plasmids were present initially. Each mutation contributes to the recombination rate. The formula I remember involves calculating the expected number of recombinant plasmids based on the observed data.\n\nLet me think about the probabilities. For each mutation type, let\u2019s say p1 is the probability of lysogenic phage and p2 for the other. If they are independent, the expected recombination would relate to the product of their frequencies.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's simpler. The experiment shows that in the presence of both mutants, the outcome depends on whether the phages are lysogenic or not. The plasmid copy number affects this. \n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of plasmids that are recombines would be r/(1-r), assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids on each lawn: On B's lawn, 4 plasmids didn't cause issues, meaning they likely lost themselves. On K's lawn, 40 plasmids caused issues, which suggests that most of them survived and replicated.\n\nWait, actually, the number of plasmids indicates the degree of loss or maintenance. So if the lysogenic phage is present, any surviving plasmids should allow the phage to replicate. Therefore, the number of plasmids on K's lawn represents the total replication plus loss, whereas on B's lawn, it's only the original plasmids.\n\nSo the ratio of plasmids on K to B could indicate the relative efficiency of replication in the presence of the other phage. This ratio relates to the recombination rate.\n\nLet me try an example. Suppose the recombination rate is r. Then, the expected number of plasmids lost due to recombination would be proportional to r. But since both phages are present, the combined effect is more complex.\n\nActually, the way this works is that each mutation has its own replication rate, and their combination leads to different outcomes. The number of plasmids on each lawn reflects the balance between the two types.\n\nGiven that 40 plasmids resulted in damage on K, and 4 on B, the ratio is 40/4 = 10 times higher. Assuming that the replication rate increases with the presence of the other phage, this ratio can help estimate the recombination rate.\n\nUsing the formula for the recombination coefficient, r, where the observed ratio is related to r as follows:\n\nln(1 - (r)/(1 + r)) \u2248 ln(r) / (1 + r)\n\nBut I might be mixing up some details here. Alternatively, using the approximation that for small r, ln(1 - r) \u2248 -r.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of plasmids on K is 10 times that on B. Since K has a higher ratio, it implies that the presence of the lysogenic phage increased the replication efficiency of the recombined plasmids. The increase factor can be used to calculate the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that the increase factor F is equal to e^{r}, then F = 10 implies r \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3, which seems high. That doesn't make sense because a recombination rate of over 2% would be unusual. Maybe my assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio is related to (1 - r)/(1 + r), which would give us 10 when solving for r. Let me set up the equation:\n\n(1 - r)/(1 + r) = 10\n\nSolving for r:\n\n1 - r = 10(1 + r)\n1 - r = 10 + 10r\n1 -10 = 10r + r\n-9 = 11r\nr = -9/11 \u2248 -0.818%\n\nThat gives a negative recombination rate, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I set it up wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Using the formula for the ratio of plasmids after selection. The ratio R = (N_B)/(N_K) = 4/40 = 1/10.\n\nAssuming that N_B is the baseline plasmid count without any mutations, and N_K includes the effect of recombination.\n\nUnder certain assumptions, the ratio R can be expressed as R = (1 - r)^n / (1 + r)^m, but this gets complicated. Alternatively, for small r, R \u2248 (1 - r).\n\nIf R = 1/10, then 1 - r \u2248 1/10 => r \u2248 0.9, which is 90%, again too high.\n\nThis suggests I'm approaching it incorrectly. Perhaps another method: The number of plasmids on each lawn corresponds to the number of active replicating plasmids. If the lysogenic phage is present, even without replication, it can cause replication. Hence, the higher number on K's lawn suggests more replication occurred despite the presence of the other phage.\n\nThe recombination rate can be estimated from the difference in plasmid counts between the two groups. The ratio of plasmids on K to B is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that the lysogenic phage's presence increases the replication efficiency by a factor, we can use the formula:\n\nr = (ln(R) - 1)/(R - 1)\n\nWhere R is the ratio of plasmids on K to B, which is 10.\n\nPlugging in R=10:\n\nr = (ln(10) - 1)/(10 -1)\nr = (2.3026 -1)/9\nr \u2248 1.3026/9 \u2248 0.1447 or 14.47%\n\nThat's over 14%, which is also very high and unlikely. Clearly, my reasoning is flawed.\n\nMaybe I should think differently. The number of plasmids lost on B's lawn compared to K's. On B's lawn, 4 plasmids didn't cause issues. On K's, 40 did. The ratio is 40/4 =10. If the lysogenic phage is present, the survival of plasmids would depend on their recombination status.\n\nAssuming that the presence of the other phage increases the survival rate of recombined plasmids, the increase factor would be 10. Thus, the recombination rate r satisfies (1 + r)/(1 - r) = 10.\n\nSolving for r:\n\n(1 + r) = 10(1 - r)\n1 + r = 10 -10r\n11r =9\nr=9/11\u22480.818 or 81.8%\n\nStill too high. Another approach: Recombination occurs when the two phages interact, allowing the host chromosome to lose the recombined plasmid. Without recombination, the host retains the full plasmid.\n\nThe number of plasmids on each lawn relates to the frequency of recombination events. If the recombination rate is r, then the proportion of recombined plasmids is r/(1 + r). But without knowing the base frequency, it's hard to apply.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids on each lawn indicates the total number of plasmids, including both wildtype and recombined ones. If the lysogenic phage is present, it can replicate even without being detected, thereby increasing the overall plasmid count.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids on K to B is 40/4=10, suggesting that the lysogenic phage's presence allowed 10 times more replication of recombined plasmids compared to just B's pure plasmids.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate r determines how much replication occurs beyond normal, the ratio could be modeled as (1 + r)/(1 - r) = 10.\n\nSolving:\n\n(1 + r)=10(1 - r)\n1 + r=10 -10r\n11r=9\nr=9/11\u22480.818 or 81.8%.\n\nAgain, same result. It's clear I'm going down the wrong path here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plasmids on each lawn is proportional to the number of times the phage replicated. Since the lysogenic phage is present, it can replicate even without being detected, thus increasing the plasmid count on K's lawn.\n\nThe ratio R = N_K / N_B = 40 /4=10.\n\nAssuming that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the replication rate by a factor, which could be approximated as R \u2248 e^{k}, where k is the replication advantage. Then, k = ln(R) = ln(10)\u22482.3.\n\nIf k is proportional to the recombination rate r, then r = k * c, where c is a constant based on other factors like the duration of replication or the number of cells. Without knowing c, it's impossible to find r exactly.\n\nSince the problem asks for the percentage recombination, perhaps the answer is around 2%. Looking back at the options, B is 2 percent. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strains split equally. \n\nThen, each group is tested separately. The first half (strain B) is dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The second half (strain K) is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? Dilution affects the likelihood of plating. If you dilute too much, fewer plasmids replicate, making it harder to get enough copies to lyse or infect. So if the phages are more common in the culture, more plasmids replicate, increasing the chance of lysing or infecting.\n\nIn this case, the E. coli strain B was treated with both mutant types. Since only the lysogenic phage did damage, some plasmids must have been lost during replication. When they're plated on strain B's lawn, those plasmids don't cause issues because the lysogenic phage isn't present anymore. However, when the same plasmid-free DNA is plated on strain K's lawn, the lysogenic phage might be able to replicate and infect, leading to more plasmids replicating and causing more damage.\n\nWait, but why are there more plasmids on K than on B? Maybe because the lysogenic phage is still present, so even without being detected, it can cause replication. Or perhaps the initial replication at low dilution rates allows for some plasmids to survive. \n\nThe key here is figuring out how many recombined plasmids were present initially. Each mutation contributes to the recombination rate. The formula I remember involves calculating the expected number of recombinant plasmids based on the observed data.\n\nLet me think about the probabilities. For each mutation type, let\u2019s say p1 is the probability of lysogenic phage and p2 for the other. If they are independent, the expected recombination would relate to the product of their frequencies.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's simpler. The experiment shows that in the presence of both mutants, the outcome depends on whether the phages are lysogenic or not. The plasmid copy number affects this. \n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of plasmids that are recombines would be r/(1-r), assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids on each lawn: On B's lawn, 4 plasmids didn't cause issues, meaning they likely lost themselves. On K's lawn, 40 plasmids caused issues, which suggests that most of them survived and replicated.\n\nWait, actually, the number of plasmids indicates the degree of loss or maintenance. So if the lysogenic phage is present, any surviving plasmids should allow the phage to replicate. Therefore, the number of plasmids on K's lawn represents the total replication plus loss, whereas on B's lawn, it's only the original plasmids.\n\nSo the ratio of plasmids on K to B could indicate the relative efficiency of replication in the presence of the other phage. This ratio relates to the recombination rate.\n\nLet me try an example. Suppose the recombination rate is r. Then, the expected number of plasmids lost due to recombination would be proportional to r. But since both phages are present, the combined effect is more complex.\n\nActually, the way this works is that each mutation has its own replication rate, and their combination leads to different outcomes. The number of plasmids on each lawn reflects the balance between the two types.\n\nGiven that 40 plasmids resulted in damage on K, and 4 on B, the ratio is 40/4 = 10 times higher. Assuming that the replication rate increases with the presence of the other phage, this ratio can help estimate the recombination rate.\n\nUsing the formula for the recombination coefficient, r, where the observed ratio is related to r as follows:\n\nln(1 - (r)/(1 + r)) \u2248 ln(r) / (1 + r)\n\nBut I might be mixing up some details here. Alternatively, using the approximation that for small r, ln(1 - r) \u2248 -r.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of plasmids on K is 10 times that on B. Since K has a higher ratio, it implies that the presence of the lysogenic phage increased the replication efficiency of the recombined plasmids. The increase factor can be used to calculate the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that the increase factor F is equal to e^{r}, then F = 10 implies r \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3, which seems high. That doesn't make sense because a recombination rate of over 2% would be unusual. Maybe my assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio is related to (1 - r)/(1 + r), which would give us 10 when solving for r. Let me set up the equation:\n\n(1 - r)/(1 + r) = 10\n\nSolving for r:\n\n1 - r = 10(1 + r)\n1 - r = 10 + 10r\n1 -10 = 10r + r\n-9 = 11r\nr = -9/11 \u2248 -0.818%\n\nThat gives a negative recombination rate, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I set it up wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Using the formula for the ratio of plasmids after selection. The ratio R = (N_B)/(N_K) = 4/40 = 1/10.\n\nAssuming that N_B is the baseline plasmid count without any mutations, and N_K includes the effect of recombination.\n\nUnder certain assumptions, the ratio R can be expressed as R = (1 - r)^n / (1 + r)^m, but this gets complicated. Alternatively, for small r, R \u2248 (1 - r).\n\nIf R = 1/10, then 1 - r \u2248 1/10 => r \u2248 0.9, which is 90%, again too high.\n\nThis suggests I'm approaching it incorrectly. Perhaps another method: The number of plasmids on each lawn corresponds to the number of active replicating plasmids. If the lysogenic phage is present, even without replication, it can cause replication. Hence, the higher number on K's lawn suggests more replication occurred despite the presence of the other phage.\n\nThe recombination rate can be estimated from the difference in plasmid counts between the two groups. The ratio of plasmids on K to B is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that the lysogenic phage's presence increases the replication efficiency by a factor, we can use the formula:\n\nr = (ln(R) - 1)/(R - 1)\n\nWhere R is the ratio of plasmids on K to B, which is 10.\n\nPlugging in R=10:\n\nr = (ln(10) - 1)/(10 -1)\nr = (2.3026 -1)/9\nr \u2248 1.3026/9 \u2248 0.1447 or 14.47%\n\nThat's over 14%, which is also very high and unlikely. Clearly, my reasoning is flawed.\n\nMaybe I should think differently. The number of plasmids lost on B's lawn compared to K's. On B's lawn, 4 plasmids didn't cause issues. On K's, 40 did. The ratio is 40/4 =10. If the lysogenic phage is present, the survival of plasmids would depend on their recombination status.\n\nAssuming that the presence of the other phage increases the survival rate of recombined plasmids, the increase factor would be 10. Thus, the recombination rate r satisfies (1 + r)/(1 - r) = 10.\n\nSolving for r:\n\n(1 + r) = 10(1 - r)\n1 + r = 10 -10r\n11r =9\nr=9/11\u22480.818 or 81.8%\n\nStill too high. Another approach: Recombination occurs when the two phages interact, allowing the host chromosome to lose the recombined plasmid. Without recombination, the host retains the full plasmid.\n\nThe number of plasmids on each lawn relates to the frequency of recombination events. If the recombination rate is r, then the proportion of recombined plasmids is r/(1 + r). But without knowing the base frequency, it's hard to apply.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids on each lawn indicates the total number of plasmids, including both wildtype and recombined ones. If the lysogenic phage is present, it can replicate even without being detected, thereby increasing the overall plasmid count.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids on K to B is 40/4=10, suggesting that the lysogenic phage's presence allowed 10 times more replication of recombined plasmids compared to just B's pure plasmids.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate r determines how much replication occurs beyond normal, the ratio could be modeled as (1 + r)/(1 - r) = 10.\n\nSolving:\n\n(1 + r)=10(1 - r)\n1 + r=10 -10r\n11r=9\nr=9/11\u22480.818 or 81.8%.\n\nAgain, same result. It's clear I'm going down the wrong path here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plasmids on each lawn is proportional to the number of times the phage replicated. Since the lysogenic phage is present, it can replicate even without being detected, thus increasing the plasmid count on K's lawn.\n\nThe ratio R = N_K / N_B = 40 /4=10.\n\nAssuming that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the replication rate by a factor, which could be approximated as R \u2248 e^{k}, where k is the replication advantage. Then, k = ln(R) = ln(10)\u22482.3.\n\nIf k is proportional to the recombination rate r, then r = k * c, where c is a constant based on other factors like the duration of replication or the number of cells. Without knowing c, it's impossible to find r exactly.\n\nSince the problem asks for the percentage recombination, perhaps the answer is around 2%. Looking back at the options, B is 2 percent. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination here refers to whether the two mutations interact or cause interference in replication. If they don't interfere, they're considered non-recombinant; if they do, they're recombinant.\n\nLooking at the numbers, the lysogenic phage should be more effective because it doesn't lyse cells. Since both types are present, the bacteria divide into two, each receiving some of the phages. However, only the lysogenic phage's offspring survive, leading to a higher number of colonies on strain K than on B.\n\nThe dilution factors suggest how much of the phage population is present. Dilution affects the probability of infection. A lower dilution (e.g., 1:10^5) means fewer phages, which would mean less chance of an individual phage causing a problem. Higher dilution (e.g., 1:10^7) allows more phages, increasing the chance of multiple infections or interference.\n\nBut wait, since only the lysogenic phage is effective, the presence of the other type might cause issues unless they're interfering. If they don't interfere, the overall effect would depend on their independent probabilities. If they do interfere, their combined effect reduces the effectiveness.\n\nThe observed 40 pluses on B and 4 on K suggests that the lysogenic phage's effect is amplified when only the lysogenic phage is present. This could indicate that they don't interfere, meaning low recombination. Low recombination implies that the two mutations don't affect each other, so the chance of both being present is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHowever, the presence of both phages also leads to division, as seen from the splitting of the culture. This suggests that both types are present in sufficient amounts to cause independent effects, except for the fact that only the lysogenic one matters. So maybe they do have some recombination, but it's low.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency (RF), we can use the formula:\n\nRF = [(p * q) - (p + q)] / (p + q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. Alternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as the proportion of doublets versus the total possible, which would relate to the recombination fraction.\n\nIn this case, since both mutations are present, and only one is effective, the doublet formation depends on whether the mutations interfere or not. If they interfere, the doublet count decreases compared to expectations without interference.\n\nIf they don't interfere, the expected doublet count would be higher. The observed doublet counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. Normally, without any interference, you'd expect a certain number, say N, and the doublets would be around N*(N-1). But in reality, the doublets are lower, suggesting some interference.\n\nWait, actually, the number of plasmids detected can help determine the interference. For example, if you have two mutations, the expected number of doublets is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of doublets \u2248 (p*q)^2 / (p + q)\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of interference, reducing the doublet count.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilutions, a higher dilution factor (more dilution) allows for more chance of both mutations occurring, potentially reducing the effective number of individuals carrying both mutations. Lower dilution might increase the chance of having both mutations, thus affecting the doublet formation.\n\nIn our case, the first sample has a dilution of 1:10^7, which is very high, meaning most phages are present, so both mutations are likely present in most cells. The second sample has a lower dilution, 1:10^5, where phages are less concentrated, but still present enough to cause some doublets.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is effective, the presence of the wild-type phage (which does not lyse) might lead to some doublets when both are present. But in our case, only the lysogenic phage was effective, so perhaps the doublets occurred when both mutations were present, but the lysogenic one caused them.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe the key point is that the presence of both mutations leads to fewer doublets than expected without interference. The calculation for RF might involve comparing the observed doublets to the expected under independence.\n\nAnother way: the probability of both mutations being present in a cell is p*q. The expected number of doublets (assuming no interference) would be (p*q)^2 * N, where N is the number of cells. But in reality, the doublets are formed when both mutations are present, and the phage survives, leading to the daughter plasmid replicating.\n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage is effective, the presence of the wild-type phage might cause the daughter plasmid to replicate even if it doesn't lyse, leading to doublets. However, if the wild-type phage didn't lyse, the daughter plasmid would replicate, forming doublets.\n\nSo, the doublets would form when both mutations are present, but the wild-type phage doesn't lyse, allowing the daughter plasmid to replicate. Therefore, the presence of the wild-type phage leads to more doublets.\n\nIn this experiment, when both types are present, the doublets increased, indicating that the presence of the wild-type phage allowed the daughter plasmid to replicate even though it didn't lyse, creating doublets.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency, which measures the likelihood that the two mutations interact. High recombination would reduce the doublets because the mutations interfere, preventing both from being present in the same cell.\n\nUsing the formula for RF:\n\nRF = [(p * q) - (p + q)] / (p + q)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Another approach is using the doublet count formula. The number of doublets can be modeled as:\n\nDoublet = [(p*q)*(p*q)] / [p + q]\n\nBut I think I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the expected number of doublets without interference is (p*q)^2 / (p + q). With interference, it's reduced.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach: the ratio of doublets observed over what would be expected under independence gives us the measure of interference.\n\nLet\u2019s denote D as the observed doublets, E as the expected under independence, and I as the interference.\n\nThen, D = E / (1 + I)\n\nRearranging, I = E / D - 1\n\nIf I > 0, there's positive interference.\n\nBut I'm not sure about this. Maybe I should consider the actual formula for RF.\n\nThe RF is often calculated as:\n\nRF = (p * q) / (p + q)\n\nWhere p and q are the allele frequencies. In this case, p and q represent the presence of each mutation.\n\nAssuming that both mutations occur at some frequency, but we need to find their frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, the RF can be estimated from the doublet count.\n\nThe formula for RF when doublets are observed is:\n\nRF = (doublets) / (total possible without interference)\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother method: the presence of both mutations in a cell leads to some number of doublets. The expectation without interference is N*(N-1)/4, assuming two alleles. But since we have two mutations, the expectation would be different.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p*q. The expected number of doublets would be proportional to (p*q)^2, but this isn't directly helpful.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of doublets observed can help estimate the interference. For instance, if the doublets are significantly higher than expected, it suggests interference.\n\nGiven that when both mutations are present, the doublets increased, that indicates some interaction between the mutations, i.e., recombination.\n\nThe exact calculation requires knowing the probabilities, but since the options are percentages, I can infer based on the relative sizes.\n\nOption F is 0.3 percent, which is close to 0.25%. Option G is 0.5%, H is 5%, etc. Given that the doublets increased, but not by much, the recombination frequency is probably low.\n\nOptions like A (1%) and others are too high, implying significant recombination, which might not fit the observed data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely option F, 0.3 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal parts, each getting half of the original culture.\n\nEach part is then treated differently: one is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination here refers to whether the two mutations interact or cause interference in replication. If they don't interfere, they're considered non-recombinant; if they do, they're recombinant.\n\nLooking at the numbers, the lysogenic phage should be more effective because it doesn't lyse cells. Since both types are present, the bacteria divide into two, each receiving some of the phages. However, only the lysogenic phage's offspring survive, leading to a higher number of colonies on strain K than on B.\n\nThe dilution factors suggest how much of the phage population is present. Dilution affects the probability of infection. A lower dilution (e.g., 1:10^5) means fewer phages, which would mean less chance of an individual phage causing a problem. Higher dilution (e.g., 1:10^7) allows more phages, increasing the chance of multiple infections or interference.\n\nBut wait, since only the lysogenic phage is effective, the presence of the other type might cause issues unless they're interfering. If they don't interfere, the overall effect would depend on their independent probabilities. If they do interfere, their combined effect reduces the effectiveness.\n\nThe observed 40 pluses on B and 4 on K suggests that the lysogenic phage's effect is amplified when only the lysogenic phage is present. This could indicate that they don't interfere, meaning low recombination. Low recombination implies that the two mutations don't affect each other, so the chance of both being present is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHowever, the presence of both phages also leads to division, as seen from the splitting of the culture. This suggests that both types are present in sufficient amounts to cause independent effects, except for the fact that only the lysogenic one matters. So maybe they do have some recombination, but it's low.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency (RF), we can use the formula:\n\nRF = [(p * q) - (p + q)] / (p + q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. Alternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as the proportion of doublets versus the total possible, which would relate to the recombination fraction.\n\nIn this case, since both mutations are present, and only one is effective, the doublet formation depends on whether the mutations interfere or not. If they interfere, the doublet count decreases compared to expectations without interference.\n\nIf they don't interfere, the expected doublet count would be higher. The observed doublet counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. Normally, without any interference, you'd expect a certain number, say N, and the doublets would be around N*(N-1). But in reality, the doublets are lower, suggesting some interference.\n\nWait, actually, the number of plasmids detected can help determine the interference. For example, if you have two mutations, the expected number of doublets is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of doublets \u2248 (p*q)^2 / (p + q)\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of interference, reducing the doublet count.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilutions, a higher dilution factor (more dilution) allows for more chance of both mutations occurring, potentially reducing the effective number of individuals carrying both mutations. Lower dilution might increase the chance of having both mutations, thus affecting the doublet formation.\n\nIn our case, the first sample has a dilution of 1:10^7, which is very high, meaning most phages are present, so both mutations are likely present in most cells.

Plumes indicate successful infection. So, the majority of the bacteria are resistant to the lysogenic phage but susceptible to the lytic one. Wait, no\u2014because if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, the lytic phage would kill them. So, maybe the resistant bacteria are those that were killed by the lysogenic phage, while the lytic phage's resistant ones might be different. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the key point is that only the lysogenic phage causes division failure. So, when the E. coli is treated with a low dilution (1:10^5), the lysogenic phage shouldn't have enough time to cause lytic fission, so most should survive. Then, when plated on strain K, which isn't affected by the lysogenic phage, you see more resistance there? Or maybe vice versa. I think I need to use the formula for recombinant rate calculation. The number of recombinants (R) is given by R = (S * D) / (1 + S * D), where S is the selection coefficient and D is the dilution factor. Alternatively, sometimes it's used as R = (S * D)/(1 - S * D).\n\nIn this case, the difference in plume numbers from the two treatments can help determine how much of the lysogenic phage has been successfully integrated into the T_4 genome. The high number of plumes on strain K suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate well, whereas the lower number on strain B indicates integration occurred.\n\nLet me try applying the formula. The dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. The ratio of plumes is 40/4=10. Using the formula R = ln(S)/ln(1/D), where S is the ratio of plumes (10). So, ln(10)=2.3026, and ln(100000)=11.5129. So, R\u22482.3026/11.5129\u22480.198 or about 20%. But wait, the options don't include 20%, so maybe I'm using the wrong approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombinant phages can be estimated by R = (N_B - N_K) / (N_B + N_K), but that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I should consider the dilution effect. The more dilution needed for the lysogenic phage to cause significant effects, the higher the recombination rate. Since the lysogenic phage was effective at a lower dilution (1:10^5), that suggests some recombination happened because without it, the phage wasn't active.\n\nThe standard method uses the formula R = (S * D)/(1 - S * D), where S is the selection coefficient. Here, S is the ratio of plumes on the two treatments. If the lysogenic phage caused fewer divisions, then S would be (number on 1e5)/(number on 1e7) = 40/4=10. So, R = 10/(1-10)= negative, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is adjusted differently.\n\nWait, let me look up the correct formula. Oh, right, the formula is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1) when selecting against the lysogenic phage. So, S is the ratio of plumes (more on lysogenic vs. non-lysogenic). Here, S = 40 (on 1e5) vs. 4 (on 1e7), so S=10. Thus, R=(10-1)/(10+1)=9/11\u22480.818 or 81.8%? That still doesn't match the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm mixing up the variables. Perhaps the correct formula is R = (S * D)/(1 - S * D), but with S being the reciprocal. If the ratio is 10, then R = 10/(1-10)=negative, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's R = (S)/(1 + S). So, R=10/(1+10)=0.909 or 90.9%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, another approach. The number of recombination events (n) can be calculated using n = (S - 1) / (S + 1), where S is the ratio of plumes. If S=10, then n=(10-1)/(10+1)=9/11\u22480.818 or 81.8%. This seems too high, but looking back at the options, the highest is F.0.3%.\n\nBut none of the options match 81.8%. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the number of recombinants is related to the logarithm of the dilution factors. Let me try calculating log(D1/D2) = log(10^7 / 10^5)=log(100)=2. So, n \u2248 2%, which is option E (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Hmm, 2% isn't an option, but 0.3% is close. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (S * D)^2, leading to (10*100000)^2=10^10, which is way too high. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought. The number of plumes (R) is proportional to the number of recombinants. The formula often used is R = (N_B - N_K)/(N_B + N_K). Here, N_B=40 and N_K=4. So, R=(40-4)/(40+4)=36/44\u22480.818 or 81.8%. Again, same issue.\n\nMaybe instead, the fraction of recombinants is (S - 1)/(S + 1), where S is the ratio of plumes. As before, 9/11\u22480.818. But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, the initial problem states that the \"resultingly saturated\" split means half the bacteria died. So, perhaps the ratio of dead to alive is 1:1. If the dead cells are those that were lysed by the phage, then the survival rate depends on the mutation status. The presence of two mutants (one causing division failure and the other lysogenically causing replication) affects the outcome.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try recalling that the number of recombinants can be approximated by the logarithm of the dilution factors. The formula R = log(D1/D2)*100 gives the percentage. Here, D1=1e7 and D2=1e5. So, D1/D2=100, log(100)=2. So, R=2% or 0.02%. Which is option E (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Closest is E.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations gave around 81%, which contradicts this. Maybe the correct formula is R = log(D1/D2)*100. So, 2%, which is option E. But why did my first approach give such a high value?\n\nPerhaps I'm misapplying the formula. The standard formula for recombinant rate when comparing two independent genes is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1), where S is the ratio of plumes. But in this experiment, the two treatments are not independent; they're sequential. So, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the expected recombinant rate under each treatment and compare.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of recombination is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1). So, S=10, R=9/11\u22480.818. But again, no matching option. However, if the formula uses natural logs, then R = ln(S)/ln(1/D). For D=1e5, ln(1e5)=11.5129, and ln(10)=2.3026. So, R\u22482.3026/11.5129\u22480.198 or ~20%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1), but expressed in terms of the dilution factors. Let's compute log(D1/D2)=log(1e7/1e5)=log(100)=2. So, R=2%, which is option E. That makes sense because the logarithmic scale shows a 2% difference in dilutions, indicating moderate recombination.\n\nSo, despite the confusion, I think the answer is E.0.05% or F.0.3%. Given that 2% isn't an option, but E is closer than F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Again, same issue.\n\nMaybe instead, the fraction of recombinants is (S - 1)/(S + 1), where S is the ratio of plumes. As before, 9/11\u22480.818. But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, the initial problem states that the \"resultingly saturated\" split means half the bacteria died. So, perhaps the ratio of dead to alive is 1:1. If the dead cells are those that were lysed by the phage, then the survival rate depends on the mutation status. The presence of two mutants (one causing division failure and the other lysogenically causing replication) affects the outcome.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try recalling that the number of recombinants can be approximated by the logarithm of the dilution factors. The formula R = log(D1/D2)*100 gives the percentage. Here, D1=1e7 and D2=1e5. So, D1/D2=100, log(100)=2. So, R=2% or 0.02%. Which is option E (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Closest is E.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations gave around 81%, which contradicts this. Maybe the correct formula is R = log(D1/D2)*100. So, 2%, which is option E. But why did my first approach give such a high value?\n\nPerhaps I'm misapplying the formula. The standard formula for recombinant rate when comparing two independent genes is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1), where S is the ratio of plumes. But in this experiment, the two treatments are not independent; they're sequential. So, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the expected recombinant rate under each treatment and compare.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of recombination is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1). So, S=10, R=9/11\u22480.818. But again, no matching option. However, if the formula uses natural logs, then R = ln(S)/ln(1/D). For D=1e5, ln(1e5)=11.5129, and ln(10)=2.3026. So, R\u22482.3026/11.5129\u22480.198 or ~20%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is R = (S - 1)/(S + 1), but expressed in terms of the dilution factors. Let's compute log(D1/D2)=log(1e7/1e5)=log(100)=2. So, R=2%, which is option E. That makes sense because the logarithmic scale shows a 2% difference in dilutions, indicating moderate recombination.\n\nSo, despite the confusion, I think the answer is E.0.05% or F.0.3%. Given that 2% isn't an option, but E is closer than F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

This means the concentration is very high, so bacteria have a hard time surviving. They get plasmid-free phages dying off quickly, leading to fewer bacteria. The second half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Here, the higher dilution allows more bacteria to survive, so some will replicate the phage again.\n\nFrom the results, there are four plumes on strain K and 40 on B. Each plume indicates a successful replication event. \n\nI remember that the number of recombinants (successful replications) relates to the efficiency of recombination between the two mutations. If the recombination rate is low, fewer plumes would form because each phage has a lower chance of combining the two mutations.\n\nThe formula for calculating the recombination coefficient (r) using the plume counts is r = ln(N1 + N2) - ln(N1), where N1 and N2 are the numbers of successful plumes on each lawn. Wait, no, actually, it's r = (ln(N1 + N2) - ln(N1)) * 100 to get percentage. So if N1=40 and N2=4, then:\n\nFirst, add them: 40 + 4 = 44.\nThen take natural logs:\nln(44) \u2248 3.784,\nln(4) \u2248 1.386.\nSubtract: 3.784 - 1.386 = 2.398.\nMultiply by 100 to get percentage: ~239.8%, which seems way too high. That must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Another approach: The probability of recombination per phage copy is p, and the expected number of plumes should relate to this. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes gives an idea about the effectiveness.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the product of the concentrations or something like that. Maybe I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, C = (number of plumes observed / expected under Poisson distribution).\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the efficiency of recombination. The expected number of plumes if there was complete recombination would be related to the product of the concentrations. But since the exact calculation isn't clear, let's think differently.\n\nThe observed recombination efficiency can be estimated by comparing the plumes from the two different dilutions. The expected number of plumes without recombination would be much less than what we observe, indicating that recombination occurred.\n\nGiven that N1=40 and N2=4, the total is 44, which suggests that each phage from strain B could potentially combine with a phage from strain K. Since there were 40 plumes on B, that implies that each phage had a 1/10 chance (since 40/400 would mean 10% efficiency) of recombining. But wait, the dilution factor is 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K. The ratio of these dilutions is 100:1, meaning that the effective dilution is 1:10^5.\n\nIf each phage from B has a 1/10 chance of recombining with a phage from K, then the expected number of plumes on K should be around 40 * 0.1 = 4, which matches our observation. Therefore, the recombination frequency (or efficiency) is approximately 10%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 2 percent, which is close but not exactly matching. However, considering rounding and possible factors, the closest option might be B (2%) as a rough estimate. Alternatively, since 10% isn't an option, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another angle: The coefficient of coincidence (C) is calculated as the observed number of plumes divided by the expected under Poisson distribution. Expected = sqrt((N1)(N2)). Here, sqrt(40*4)=sqrt(160)=~12.65. Observed=N1=40. So C=40/12.65\u22483.16, which is much greater than 1, implying overrecombinant events. That can't be right. Maybe I got it backward.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is C = (observed)/(expected) = (40)/(sqrt(40*4)) = 40/(8.944)\u22484.47. Still over 1, which suggests more than expected. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of successful plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations. Since the dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, the relative efficiency is (1e-5)/(1e-7)=100. So each phage from B has a 1/100 chance of recombining with a phage from K. Thus, the expected number of plumes on K would be 40*(1/100)=0.4, but we saw 4. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the dilution factors affect the efficiency inversely. If the dilution for B is 1e-7 and K is 1e-5, the ratio is 1e2, meaning each phage from B has a 1e-2 chance of recombining. So expected plumes on K would be 40*0.01=0.4, but we have 4. That's inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about how dilution affects recombination efficiency might be incorrect. Perhaps the actual efficiency is higher.\n\nAnother possibility: The number of plumes is directly proportional to the efficiency. Since we have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the ratio is 1:10. If the efficiency is e, then e = (plumes_B / plumes_K) = 40 /4=10. So e=10, meaning the efficiency is 10 times higher on B than K. But this doesn't make sense because K should have higher efficiency due to the higher dilution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the efficiency is inversely related. If the efficiency is e, then plumes_B = e * plumes_K. So 40=e*4 => e=10. That would imply that the efficiency is 10, which is impossible because you can't have more than 100% efficiency.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a standard formula or example. In phage genetics, the coefficient of coincidence (C) is given by C = observed / expected, where observed is the number of doublets (both phases on same lawn), and expected is the square root of the product of the individual counts.\n\nIn our case, observed is 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, no, the observed is the number of doublets. Actually, each phage from B could pair with a phage from K. So the expected number of doublets would be sqrt(40 *4)=sqrt(160)=~12.65. We observed 4 doublets, so C=4/12.65\u22480.316, which is about 31%. That\u2019s quite high, suggesting almost all pairs recombine, which contradicts the earlier observation.\n\nAlternatively, if the efficiency is high, say 10%, then expected doublets would be 40*4 *10% = 16, but we have 4. That suggests that the efficiency is much lower.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me try again. The number of doublets (both phages on same lawn) is 4 on K and 40 on B. So expected doublets assuming no recombination would be sqrt(40*4)=12.65. Actual observed is 4, so C=4/12.65\u22480.316. This suggests that only about 32% of the potential doublets recombine. So the recombination efficiency is 32%. But none of the options match that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is C = (observed) / (expected). So 4 /12.65\u22480.316, which is 31.6%. This suggests a high recombination efficiency, but that doesn't fit with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is C = (observed) / (expected). So if observed is 4, expected is 12.65, then C\u22480.316, which is 31.6%. That's a high value, but the options don't include that. The highest option is G (0.5%), so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe the formula should be C = (observed) / (expected), but the expected is (total B phages)^2? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is C = (observed) / (expected), where expected is (n1 * n2). So if n1=40 and n2=4, expected=160, and observed=4, then C=4/160=0.025 or 2.5%. That aligns with option F (0.3%). But why?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. The coefficient of coincidence C is defined as the observed number of doublets divided by the expected number of doublets. Expected number is calculated as the square root of the product of the number of single phages on each lawn. So in this case, the single phages on B are 40, and on K are 4. So expected doublets = sqrt(40*4)=sqrt(160)=~12.65. Observed doublets=4. So C=4/12.65\u22480.316 or 31.6%, which is still not matching any options except G (0.5%).\n\nWait, maybe the confusion arises from whether the doublets refer to both phages or just one. In this case, each phage from B can pair with one from K, so the number of potential doublets is 40*4=160. The observed doublets are 4, so C=4/160=0.025 or 2.5%. That's 2.5%, which corresponds to option F (0.3%). Closest to that is option F. But I thought I got 31.6% before, which didn't match any option. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the number of successful plumes instead of doublets. If we have 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, then the efficiency would be 4/40=0.1 or 10%, but that's not among the options either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given the options, and knowing that the answer is likely around 1%, I'll go with option H (0.05%) or D (0.01%). But I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2%, which is option B.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of recombination events is proportional to the product of the concentrations. Since the dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, their ratio is 100:1. So each phage from B has a 1/100 chance of recombining with a phage from K. Therefore, the expected number of doublets would be (40 * 4)/100 = 1.6. But we have 4, which is higher. So perhaps the actual efficiency is slightly higher than 100%, but that's not realistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the efficiency is 2%, which is option B. Because 2% of 40 is 0.8, but we have 4, which is twice as much. Not sure.\n\nWait, I think I've spent enough time thinking through this. Based on the calculations, the most reasonable answer from the options provided is B (2%), as it reflects a moderate recombination efficiency that fits the experimental data.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal halves, each being half the original number.\n\nThe first half is then dilated 1:10^7 and plated on a strain B lawn. This means the concentration is very high, so bacteria have a hard time surviving. They get plasmid-free phages dying off quickly, leading to fewer bacteria.

So if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, maybe it doesn't induce division, which would mean that only the lytic phage (mutant) would cause division.\n\nBut the initial statement says that both mutant types are present, leading to division in half. Hmm. Maybe the lysogenic phage is present and sometimes causes division, but the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it might not induce division as much, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the double resistivity. If both mutations are present, the phage might have double resistance, which would kill the bacteria. If both mutations don't recombine, their effects are additive, so the probability of both occurring increases.\n\nGiven the results, when both phages are present, one half dies more than the other. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, perhaps it's acting as an inducer, but I'm getting tangled up.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the plus counts. On the B lawn, 40 plusions; on K, 4. That's a big difference. Perhaps the recombination rate determines how many times both mutations occur together. If the mutations are tightly linked, you'd expect more double plusions, but here, the plusions per lawn are quite different.\n\nWait, the total number of plusions is 40+4=44. Each culture is 1/10^7 or 1/10^5 dilutions. The dilution factor affects the probability of plugging in a bacterium with both mutations.\n\nSo the expected number of double plusions (both mutations) would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the probability that a phage carries mutation X, q as mutation Y. Then, the probability of both mutations in a phage is pq.\n\nWhen the phage is plated on the lawn, the chance of a phage carrying both mutations is pq * (1/10^x), where x is the dilution factor.\n\nEach culture has two halves: one with higher dilution (1:10^7) and one with lower (1:10^5). So the total expectation for double plusions would be:\n\n(1/2)*[pq*(1/10^7)] + (1/2)*[pq*(1/10^5)]\n\nThis equals pq*(1/2)*(1/10^7 + 1/10^5)\n\nSimilarly, for the other half, the expectation would be:\n\n(1/2)*[pq*(1/10^5)] + (1/2)*[pq*(1/10^7)]\n\nWhich equals pq*(1/2)*(1/10^5 + 1/10^7)\n\nBut according to the results, on B, there are 40 plusions, and on K, 4. These are pluses, not double plusions. So the pluses would come from either a lysogenic phage without any mutation (if that's possible), or the lysogenic phage having only the mutation in the lysogenic part.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider the likelihood of the mutations affecting the outcome.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, its presence leads to division. But why did only E. coli strain B die? Maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't cause division, so only the lytic phage (mutant) causes division. But the problem says both mutants are present, leading to division in half. So perhaps the lysogenic phage somehow doesn't lyse, causing division, while the lytic phage does, killing them.\n\nBut that seems contradictory. Maybe the lysogenic phage is the one that doesn't lyse, so it doesn't cause division, but the lytic phage does. However, the problem states that both mutants are present and lead to division in half, implying that both mutations contribute to the same outcome.\n\nWait, maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it doesn't cause division, but the lytic phage does. But if both are present, maybe the lysogenic phage is active and causes division, while the lytic phage does not. But the problem says both mutants are present, leading to division in half, so perhaps the presence of both causes the same effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to lyse more easily, causing more division, while the lytic phage has another mutation that also allows it to lyse more easily, leading to more division.\n\nWait, but the problem says that only the lysogenic phage causes division in strain B, but not in strain K. So in the first case, when both are present, the E. coli strains split into two equal parts. One half is dilutated 1:10^7 and placed on B's lawn, resulting in 40 plusions. The other half is placed on K's lawn, giving 4 plusions.\n\nHmm. So on B's lawn, 40 plusions occurred when both mutants are present. On K's lawn, 4 plusions occurred. So when both mutants are present, B shows more division, and K shows less.\n\nNow, considering the double resistance scenario, if both mutants are present, the bacteria would die, but that's not happening here. Instead, some survive, showing plusions.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it might not cause division, but the lytic phage does. So in the presence of both mutants, perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't cause division, while the lytic phage does. But the problem says that when both are present, the E. coli splits into two halves, each half being treated separately.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model the expected number of plusions. The expected number of plusions would depend on the recombination rate between the two mutations.\n\nSuppose the two mutations are linked, so they occur near each other on the chromosome. Let r be the coefficient of coincidence, which measures the correlation between the occurrences of the two mutations. If they are tightly linked, r would be high, meaning that the occurrence of one mutation correlates with the occurrence of the other.\n\nIn this experiment, the number of plusions observed on each lawn can help us determine the recombination fraction, which is related to the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence C is:\n\nC = (number of double plusions) / (expected number of double plusions)\n\nAssuming that the two events (mutation X and mutation Y) are independent except for recombination, the expected number of double plusions would be:\n\nE = (frequency of mutation X) * (frequency of mutation Y) * (probability of crossing over)\n\nBut if they're tightly linked, the probability of crossing over is very low, say \u03b5. Therefore, the expected number of double plusions would be approximately:\n\nE \u2248 (frequency of X) * (frequency of Y) * (1 - \u03b5)\n\nBut since \u03b5 is small, we can approximate E as (f_X * f_Y).\n\nHowever, in our case, the observed number of plusions on each lawn is different, so we can calculate the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nOn the B lawn, 40 plusions, and on the K lawn, 4 plusions. Assuming that the double resistance is rare, the majority of plusions are single resistance.\n\nWait, but the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, the recombination rate r is related to the coefficient of coincidence C by:\n\nC \u2248 (r)/(1 - r)\n\nBecause C = r / (1 - r), assuming that the mutations are tightly linked.\n\nIf we can estimate C, we can solve for r.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nTotal plusions = 40 (on B) + 4 (on K) = 44.\n\nEach culture is treated once, so the total plusions per culture would be 40 + 4 = 44, spread equally on both halves. But actually, the half with higher dilution (1:10^7) is placed on B's lawn, and the other half on K's lawn.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual plusions are distributed as follows:\n\n- The half with higher dilution (1:10^7) is placed on B's lawn, resulting in 40 plusions.\n- The half with lower dilution (1:10^5) is placed on K's lawn, resulting in 4 plusions.\n\nTherefore, the total plusions per culture are 40 (on B) + 4 (on K) = 44.\n\nEach half culture is treated with 1/10^7 and 1/10^5 dilution, respectively.\n\nNow, the expected number of plusions for each half would be proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nFor the B half, which is 1:10^7, the expected number of plusions would be (1/10^7) * (number of plusions expected per culture).\n\nSimilarly, for the K half, which is 1:10^5, the expected number would be (1/10^5) * (number of plusions per culture).\n\nAssuming that each culture produces n plusions, the expected number on the B half would be (n / 10^7) * (40 + 4) = n * (44 / 10^7).\n\nSimilarly, on the K half, it would be n * (44 / 10^5).\n\nBut this seems too abstract. Let's instead use the fact that the coefficient of coincidence C is given by:\n\nC = (number of double plusions) / (expected number of double plusions)\n\nFrom the experiment, on the B half, 40 plusions occurred, and on the K half, 4 plusions occurred. So the total plusions across both halves are 44.\n\nAssuming that the double resistance occurs rarely, the majority of plusions are single resistance. Let\u2019s assume that the double resistance is r plusions out of 44. Then:\n\nC = r / (44 - r)\n\nWe need to estimate r.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, then the recombination rate r is low, and C would be high. Conversely, if the mutations are far apart, C approaches zero.\n\nFrom the problem, the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse, so it doesn\u2019t cause division. Only the lytic phage does. So, when both mutants are present, the E. coli cells divide because only the lytic phage (mutant) causes division. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse) doesn't cause division, while the lytic phage (mutant) does.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when both are present, the E. coli divides into two halves, each being treated with different dilutions. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't cause division, while the lytic phage does. But why would both mutants cause division? Unless the lysogenic phage can somehow cause division even without itself lyseing.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that allows it to lyse more easily, hence causing division. The lytic phage, despite having a mutation in the lysogenic region, doesn't lyse as effectively, so it doesn't cause division. But in this experiment, both mutants are present, so perhaps the lysogenic phage still causes division.\n\nBut the problem states that when both are present, the E. coli divides into two, suggesting that both mutants cause division. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, but its mutation allows it to lyse more easily, thus dividing the E. coli. The lytic phage, even though it has a mutation elsewhere, doesn't lyse as well, so it doesn't divide.\n\nBut the problem says that when both are present, the E. coli divides, so perhaps the lysogenic phage with its mutation causes division, while the lytic phage without mutation doesn't.\n\nBut the experiment includes both mutants, so perhaps the presence of both causes division, indicating that the mutation in the lysogenic phage allows it to lyse more, causing division.\n\nNow, going back to the plusions. The B lawn had 40 plusions, and the K had 4. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, then perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to division, but the lysogenic phage alone doesn't. So, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that allows it to lyse more easily, causing division, while the lytic phage has another mutation that prevents it from doing so.\n\nBut the problem mentions that when both are present, the E. coli divides into two, so perhaps the lysogenic phage, despite not lyseing, has a mutation that allows it to lyse more, leading to division.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think in terms of the expected number of plusions.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, then the recombination rate r is low, say 1%. Then, the coefficient of coincidence C would be approximately r / (1 - r). For r=1%, C\u22480.01 / 0.99\u22480.01.\n\nIf C is around 0.01, then using C=r/(1-r), solving for r gives r\u22480.01.\n\nBut let's test this. Suppose r=1% (so C\u22480.01). Then, the expected number of double plusions would be roughly 1% of the total plusions.\n\nTotal plusions are 44, so double plusions would be ~0.44, which isn't a whole number. But since the problem states that on the B half, 40 plusions occurred, which is significantly higher than expected, perhaps r is larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination rate is such that the coefficient of coincidence is higher. If r is 2%, then C\u22480.02 / 0.98\u22480.02. Total plusions are 44, so double plusions would be 0.88, which still doesn't match the observed 40 and 4.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.05% (r=0.05%), then C\u22480.05 / 0.9995\u22480.05. Double plusions would be 0.05*44\u22482.2, which is way off.\n\nWait, this approach might not be correct. Another way is to calculate the expected number of double plusions under linkage and compare it to what was observed.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked with recombination rate r, then the expected number of double plusions would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation, adjusted for crossing over. But since r is low, the crossing over probability is negligible, so E \u2248 f_X * f_Y.\n\nAssuming that the frequency of each mutation is p and q, then E \u2248 p*q.\n\nBut without knowing p and q, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of coincidence C can be calculated as:\n\nC = (observed double plusions) / (expected double plusions)\n\nIf the double plusions are rare, C is small. If they're common, C is large.\n\nIn our case, the double plusions are 40 on B and 4 on K. Given that the total is 44, the double plusions on B are almost 90% of the total. That suggests that the mutations are highly associated, i.e., tightly linked.\n\nThus, C is high. For example, if C is about 0.5, then:\n\nC = (double plusions) / (expected double plusions)\n\nSo, suppose there are D double plusions. Then,\n\nC = D / (D + (n - D))\n\nWhere n is the total plusions (44). Solving for D:\n\nD = C * n\n\nIf C=0.5,\n\nD=22\n\nThen,\n\n0.5 = 22 / 44 => Correct.\n\nBut in reality, the double plusions on B are 40, on K are 4, totaling 44. So, if D=40, then:\n\nC=40/44\u22480.909\n\nThat's a high C value, which indicates a strong linkage.\n\nNow, relating C to r:\n\nC \u2248 r / (1 - r)\n\nSolving for r,\n\nr \u2248 C * (1 - r)\n\nr + Cr \u2248 C\n\nr(1 + C) \u2248 C\n\nr \u2248 C / (",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli divides into two equal parts, each being half the original.\n\nOne half is dilute 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is dilute 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After plating, there are four plusions on K and 40 on B. I think this relates to double resistance or something about how mutations interact.\n\nWait, if only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, then any mutation in the lysogenic phage would cause issues. But here, both phages are present, so maybe some combination occurs? Or perhaps the mutations interfere with each other.\n\nThe question asks for the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If the two mutations are linked, their occurrence in a host will be correlated. So, if both mutations happen together, it suggests they are close on the chromosome.\n\nIn the experiment, since both phages are present, the presence of both mutations might indicate how often both occur together. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect fewer recombinants, but here, we see a certain number of plusions, which could relate to the frequency of recombination.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at the numbers. On the B lawn, 40 plusions, and on K, 4. So on the B lawn, the ratio is 40/(total), which depends on dilution. Similarly, on K, 4 plusions. \n\nIf the two mutations didn't recombine, you'd expect more plusions where both mutations are present. But here, 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the mutations affect the same target site or different ones.\n\nAnother approach: when both phages are present, the E. coli splits. One half has the lysogenic phage and may have double resistance, while the other has the lytic phage and no resistance. The one with lysogeny might have a lower chance of causing problems, but wait, the result was that the lysogenic phage caused division in half, so perhaps the lysogenic phage is more effective?\n\nBut the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so maybe it's the lysogenic phage that induces division. Wait, no, the lysogenic phage usually induces lysis, right? Because it integrates into the genome and uses the quorum sensing system to decide when to replicate. So if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, maybe it doesn't induce division, which would mean that only the lytic phage (mutant) would cause division.\n\nBut the initial statement says that both mutant types are present, leading to division in half. Hmm. Maybe the lysogenic phage is present and sometimes causes division, but the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it might not induce division as much, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the double resistivity. If both mutations are present, the phage might have double resistance, which would kill the bacteria. If both mutations don't recombine, their effects are additive, so the probability of both occurring increases.\n\nGiven the results, when both phages are present, one half dies more than the other. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, perhaps it's acting as an inducer, but I'm getting tangled up.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the plus counts. On the B lawn, 40 plusions; on K, 4. That's a big difference. Perhaps the recombination rate determines how many times both mutations occur together. If the mutations are tightly linked, you'd expect more double plusions, but here, the plusions per lawn are quite different.\n\nWait, the total number of plusions is 40+4=44. Each culture is 1/10^7 or 1/10^5 dilutions. The dilution factor affects the probability of plugging in a bacterium with both mutations.\n\nSo the expected number of double plusions (both mutations) would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the probability that a phage carries mutation X, q as mutation Y. Then, the probability of both mutations in a phage is pq.\n\nWhen the phage is plated on the lawn, the chance of a phage carrying both mutations is pq * (1/10^x), where x is the dilution factor.\n\nEach culture has two halves: one with higher dilution (1:10^7) and one with lower (1:10^5). So the total expectation for double plusions would be:\n\n(1/2)*[pq*(1/10^7)] + (1/2)*[pq*(1/10^5)]\n\nThis equals pq*(1/2)*(1/10^7 + 1/10^5)\n\nSimilarly, for the other half, the expectation would be:\n\n(1/2)*[pq*(1/10^5)] + (1/2)*[pq*(1/10^7)]\n\nWhich equals pq*(1/2)*(1/10^5 + 1/10^7)\n\nBut according to the results, on B, there are 40 plusions, and on K, 4. These are pluses, not double plusions. So the pluses would come from either a lysogenic phage without any mutation (if that's possible), or the lysogenic phage having only the mutation in the lysogenic part.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider the likelihood of the mutations affecting the outcome.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, its presence leads to division. But why did only E. coli strain B die? Maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't cause division, so only the lytic phage (mutant) causes division. But the problem says both mutants are present, leading to division in half. So perhaps the lysogenic phage somehow doesn't lyse, causing division, while the lytic phage does, killing them.\n\nBut that seems contradictory. Maybe the lysogenic phage is the one that doesn't lyse, so it doesn't cause division, but the lytic phage does. However, the problem states that both mutants are present and lead to division in half, implying that both mutations contribute to the same outcome.\n\nWait, maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it doesn't cause division, but the lytic phage does.

So in the first case, when both are present, the E. coli strains split into two equal parts. One half is dilutated 1:10^7 and placed on B's lawn, resulting in 40 plusions. The other half is placed on K's lawn, giving 4 plusions.\n\nHmm. So on B's lawn, 40 plusions occurred when both mutants are present. On K's lawn, 4 plusions occurred. So when both mutants are present, B shows more division, and K shows less.\n\nNow, considering the double resistance scenario, if both mutants are present, the bacteria would die, but that's not happening here. Instead, some survive, showing plusions.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it might not cause division, but the lytic phage does. So in the presence of both mutants, perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't cause division, while the lytic phage does. But the problem says that when both are present, the E. coli splits into two halves, each half being treated separately.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model the expected number of plusions. The expected number of plusions would depend on the recombination rate between the two mutations.\n\nSuppose the two mutations are linked, so they occur near each other on the chromosome. Let r be the coefficient of coincidence, which measures the correlation between the occurrences of the two mutations. If they are tightly linked, r would be high, meaning that the occurrence of one mutation correlates with the occurrence of the other.\n\nIn this experiment, the number of plusions observed on each lawn can help us determine the recombination fraction, which is related to the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence C is:\n\nC = (number of double plusions) / (expected number of double plusions)\n\nAssuming that the two events (mutation X and mutation Y) are independent except for recombination, the expected number of double plusions would be:\n\nE = (frequency of mutation X) * (frequency of mutation Y) * (probability of crossing over)\n\nBut if they're tightly linked, the probability of crossing over is very low, say \u03b5. Therefore, the expected number of double plusions would be approximately:\n\nE \u2248 (frequency of X) * (frequency of Y) * (1 - \u03b5)\n\nBut since \u03b5 is small, we can approximate E as (f_X * f_Y).\n\nHowever, in our case, the observed number of plusions on each lawn is different, so we can calculate the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nOn the B lawn, 40 plusions, and on the K lawn, 4 plusions. Assuming that the double resistance is rare, the majority of plusions are single resistance.\n\nWait, but the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, the recombination rate r is related to the coefficient of coincidence C by:\n\nC \u2248 (r)/(1 - r)\n\nBecause C = r / (1 - r), assuming that the mutations are tightly linked.\n\nIf we can estimate C, we can solve for r.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nTotal plusions = 40 (on B) + 4 (on K) = 44.\n\nEach culture is treated once, so the total plusions per culture would be 40 + 4 = 44, spread equally on both halves. But actually, the half with higher dilution (1:10^7) is placed on B's lawn, and the other half on K's lawn.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual plusions are distributed as follows:\n\n- The half with higher dilution (1:10^7) is placed on B's lawn, resulting in 40 plusions.\n- The half with lower dilution (1:10^5) is placed on K's lawn, resulting in 4 plusions.\n\nTherefore, the total plusions per culture are 40 (on B) + 4 (on K) = 44.\n\nEach half culture is treated with 1/10^7 and 1/10^5 dilution, respectively.\n\nNow, the expected number of plusions for each half would be proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nFor the B half, which is 1:10^7, the expected number of plusions would be (1/10^7) * (number of plusions expected per culture).\n\nSimilarly, for the K half, which is 1:10^5, the expected number would be (1/10^5) * (number of plusions per culture).\n\nAssuming that each culture produces n plusions, the expected number on the B half would be (n / 10^7) * (40 + 4) = n * (44 / 10^7).\n\nSimilarly, on the K half, it would be n * (44 / 10^5).\n\nBut this seems too abstract. Let's instead use the fact that the coefficient of coincidence C is given by:\n\nC = (number of double plusions) / (expected number of double plusions)\n\nFrom the experiment, on the B half, 40 plusions occurred, and on the K half, 4 plusions occurred. So the total plusions across both halves are 44.\n\nAssuming that the double resistance occurs rarely, the majority of plusions are single resistance. Let\u2019s assume that the double resistance is r plusions out of 44. Then:\n\nC = r / (44 - r)\n\nWe need to estimate r.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, then the recombination rate r is low, and C would be high. Conversely, if the mutations are far apart, C approaches zero.\n\nFrom the problem, the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse, so it doesn\u2019t cause division. Only the lytic phage does. So, when both mutants are present, the E. coli cells divide because only the lytic phage (mutant) causes division. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse) doesn't cause division, while the lytic phage (mutant) does.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when both are present, the E. coli divides into two halves, each being treated with different dilutions. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't cause division, while the lytic phage does. But why would both mutants cause division? Unless the lysogenic phage can somehow cause division even without itself lyseing.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that allows it to lyse more easily, hence causing division. The lytic phage, despite having a mutation in the lysogenic region, doesn't lyse as effectively, so it doesn't cause division. But in this experiment, both mutants are present, so perhaps the lysogenic phage still causes division.\n\nBut the problem states that when both are present, the E. coli divides into two, suggesting that both mutants cause division.

The B lawn had 40 plusions, and the K had 4. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, then perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to division, but the lysogenic phage alone doesn't. So, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that allows it to lyse more easily, causing division, while the lytic phage has another mutation that prevents it from doing so.\n\nBut the problem mentions that when both are present, the E. coli divides into two, so perhaps the lysogenic phage, despite not lyseing, has a mutation that allows it to lyse more, leading to division.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think in terms of the expected number of plusions.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, then the recombination rate r is low, say 1%. Then, the coefficient of coincidence C would be approximately r / (1 - r). For r=1%, C\u22480.01 / 0.99\u22480.01.\n\nIf C is around 0.01, then using C=r/(1-r), solving for r gives r\u22480.01.\n\nBut let's test this. Suppose r=1% (so C\u22480.01). Then, the expected number of double plusions would be roughly 1% of the total plusions.\n\nTotal plusions are 44, so double plusions would be ~0.44, which isn't a whole number. But since the problem states that on the B half, 40 plusions occurred, which is significantly higher than expected, perhaps r is larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination rate is such that the coefficient of coincidence is higher. If r is 2%, then C\u22480.02 / 0.98\u22480.02. Total plusions are 44, so double plusions would be 0.88, which still doesn't match the observed 40 and 4.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.05% (r=0.05%), then C\u22480.05 / 0.9995\u22480.05. Double plusions would be 0.05*44\u22482.2, which is way off.\n\nWait, this approach might not be correct. Another way is to calculate the expected number of double plusions under linkage and compare it to what was observed.\n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked with recombination rate r, then the expected number of double plusions would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation, adjusted for crossing over. But since r is low, the crossing over probability is negligible, so E \u2248 f_X * f_Y.\n\nAssuming that the frequency of each mutation is p and q, then E \u2248 p*q.\n\nBut without knowing p and q, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of coincidence C can be calculated as:\n\nC = (observed double plusions) / (expected double plusions)\n\nIf the double plusions are rare, C is small. If they're common, C is large.\n\nIn our case, the double plusions are 40 on B and 4 on K. Given that the total is 44, the double plusions on B are almost 90% of the total. That suggests that the mutations are highly associated, i.e., tightly linked.\n\nThus, C is high. For example, if C is about 0.5, then:\n\nC = (double plusions) / (expected double plusions)\n\nSo, suppose there are D double plusions. Then,\n\nC = D / (D + (n - D))\n\nWhere n is the total plusions (44). Solving for D:\n\nD = C * n\n\nIf C=0.5,\n\nD=22\n\nThen,\n\n0.5 = 22 / 44 => Correct.\n\nBut in reality, the double plusions on B are 40, on K are 4, totaling 44. So, if D=40, then:\n\nC=40/44\u22480.909\n\nThat's a high C value, which indicates a strong linkage.\n\nNow, relating C to r:\n\nC \u2248 r / (1 - r)\n\nSolving for r,\n\nr \u2248 C * (1 - r)\n\nr + Cr \u2248 C\n\nr(1 + C) \u2248 C\n\nr \u2248 C / (",

The other half was diluted more gently (1:10^5) and then placed on a strain K lawn. After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that in such experiments, the number of recombinants depends on how many of each type successfully replicated or integrated into the phage's DNA. Recombination refers to the chance that a mutation from one phage combines with a mutation from another phage. If both mutations are from the same phage, there's no recombination; if they're from different phages, there's recombination.\n\nIn the case where only one type is effective (like lysogenic), you'd expect fewer recombinant plasmids compared to when both types are effective. Here, since only strain B was affected, the majority of successful plasmid copies must come from the lysogenic phage. So, the presence of more plasmids on K suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one causing lytic fission) has some recombination with itself? Or maybe it's about the dilution stages.\n\nWait, actually, when both phages are present, the E. coli that lose replication origin (from the lysogenic phage) will integrate its plasmid into the lysogenic phage, creating a recombined phage. Since the lysogenic phage is active, it would replicate more efficiently, leading to more successful plasmid integration. This should increase the number of plasmids on the strain B lawn because the lysogenic phage is better at replicating. But here, on strain K, the plasmids haven't integrated as much, meaning less recombination happened.\n\nSo, the difference in the number of plasmids on each lawn (4 vs. 40) tells us about the efficiency of plasmid replication. More plasmids on strain B mean more efficient replication, suggesting that the lysogenic phage integrated well. On strain K, fewer plasmids indicate less efficient replication, implying less recombination or perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't copy the plasmid effectively.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for recombination between the two mutations, not necessarily about which phage caused what. Each mutation comes from the same phage (T_4), so the recombination refers to whether these two mutations occurred on the same phage molecule. If there was recombination, that would mean that the two mutations came from the same phage, either overlapping or complementary.\n\nThe formula I recall is that the expected number of recombinants R is given by:\n\nR = (p)(q) + 2(p)(q)(f)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the mutations, and f is the fraction of time the phage is active. But in our case, we don't have exact frequencies, so maybe a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the ratio of plasmids on each lawn. On strain B, 4 plasmids, on strain K, 40. Assuming that the total number of plasmids transferred from the lysogenic phage is similar across both lichens, but the efficiency varies due to recombination.\n\nIf there was complete recombination, all the plasmids would come from the lysogenic phage, leading to higher numbers on strain B. Conversely, if there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage might replicate without integrating, leading to fewer plasmids on strain B. However, in our case, strain K has more plasmids than strain B, which seems counterintuitive unless the lysogenic phage integrated partially.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again. If the lysogenic phage integrates fully, it should be more efficient, so more plasmids on strain B. But here, strain K has more plasmids, which implies that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate as well, possibly due to incomplete recombination or reduced activity.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the recombination between the two mutations within the T_4 phage. So, the recombination frequency (RF) is the probability that a plasmid from one phage integrates into a phage from another. In this context, both mutations are from the same phage, so RF would determine how often these two mutations appear together.\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual RF value, we can estimate based on the observed data. The number of plasmids on each lawn gives an indication of how many times the phage has replicated. If the phage had recombined, more plasmids would accumulate, but if not, fewer.\n\nGiven that strain B received more plasmids (4 vs. 40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage replicated more efficiently, implying more recombination or better replication. But since the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations, which are both derived from the same phage, perhaps the calculation involves determining how many of the plasmids were actually recombined.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected = Total Plasmids * (Probability of Recombination)^2\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is low, say 0.01, then Expected \u2248 Total Plasmids * 0.0001.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nStrain B: 4 plasmids \u2192 4 * 0.0001 = 0.0004 expected recombinants.\nStrain K: 40 plasmids \u2192 40 * 0.0001 = 0.004 expected recombinants.\n\nBut the problem states that four pluses are found on K, which corresponds to four recombinant plasmids. Similarly, four on B. Wait, maybe each plus represents a single successful integration.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: Each plus indicates one successful integration. So, if four plus are found on K, that means four recombinant plasmids. Similarly, four on B.\n\nSo, the ratio of plasmids on K to B is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. If the expected number of recombinants is proportional to the plasmid counts, then the number of recombinants per lawn should also be in the same ratio.\n\nTherefore, the number of recombinants on K is 4, and on B is 40. So, the ratio is 1:10, meaning that the number of recombinants on K is 1/10th of those on B. This suggests that the recombination event is relatively rare, implying a low recombination frequency.\n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids on K / Total Plasmids on K) / (Number of Recombinant Plasmids on B / Total Plasmids on B)\n\nBut since the number of plasmids on each lawn is equal (because they were treated similarly), the ratio of recombinant plasmids would directly reflect the ratio of recombination events.\n\nThus, RF = (4 / 40) = 0.1 or 10%.\n\nBut wait, that can\u2019t be right because the options don\u2019t go up to 10%. The highest option is F: 0.3 percent, and G: 0.5 percent. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the ratio of plasmid transfer efficiency. The ratio on K is 4 and on B is 40, so the efficiency on K is 1/10th of B. If the efficiency is related to the square of the recombination frequency (since efficiency decreases with the square of the distance between replication origins), then:\n\n(Reciprocal of efficiency on K) = (Reciprocal of efficiency on B) * (1 - RF)^2\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids transferred is inversely proportional to the efficiency squared, so sqrt(e_B / e_K) = 1 / sqrt(RF).\n\nHere, e_B / e_K = 40 / 4 = 10.\n\nSo, sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 = 1 / sqrt(RF) \u2192 RF \u2248 1 / (3.16)^2 \u2248 1 / 10 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.1 or 10%, which again conflicts with the answer choices.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: The expected number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage contributing the mutation. If both mutations are from the same phage, the probability of recombination is RF. Therefore, the expected number of recombinants would be RF * N, where N is the total number of plasmids.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's tricky. Alternatively, the number of plasmids transferred is the same for both treatments, so the ratio of plasmids gives an idea of the efficiency. Since K has 10 times fewer plasmids, the efficiency is lower, indicating lower recombination.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest match to a low recombination frequency is D: 0.1 percent and E: 0.2 percent. Since 10% isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me try again. Suppose that the number of plasmids transferred is the same for both treatments, and the efficiency on K is 1/10th of B. Then, the efficiency is related to (1 - RF)^2, because the efficiency decreases with the square of the distance between origins.\n\nSo, e_K = e_B * (1 - RF)^2\n\nWe know that e_K = e_B / 10, so:\n\ne_B / 10 = e_B * (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 Divide both sides by e_B:\n\n1/10 = (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 Take square root:\n\nsqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 = 1 - RF \u2192 RF \u2248 1 - 0.316 = 0.684 \u2192 ~68.4%\n\nThat's a high recombination frequency, which contradicts the earlier reasoning.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plasmids on each lawn reflects the efficiency of replication. Strain B had higher efficiency, meaning fewer plasmids. If recombination occurs, it affects the efficiency differently.\n\nWait, another thought: If there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate without integrating, leading to fewer plasmids. If there was recombination, some plasmids would have been integrated, increasing the number. So, in our case, K has more plasmids, implying less recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency is low.\n\nTo estimate RF, suppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage replicates and produces more plasmids. With recombination, some plasmids are already integrated before replication, reducing the number of new plasmids. But this complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the efficiency. If the lysogenic phage on K has 1/10th the efficiency of B, then the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th, assuming the same number of plasmids transferred. But I'm not sure how to calculate RF from this.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is C: 1.5 percent, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the number of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage on K has 1/10th the efficiency, then the recombination frequency is such that the number of plasmids is 1/10th, implying RF = 90%, which is too high.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe looking for a pattern: If the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th of B, and assuming that recombination reduces the efficiency, then the recombination frequency would make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: 0.2 percent because 1/10 is 10%, but I'm not seeing the direct relation.\n\nWait, going back to the formula for recombination frequency: If the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th of B, and assuming that the number of plasmids is proportional to the efficiency, then the efficiency on K is 1/10th of B. Since efficiency decreases with (1 - RF)^2, we have:\n\nEfficiency on K = Efficiency on B * (1 - RF)^2\n\n1/10 = 1 * (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 (1 - RF)^2 = 1/10 \u2192 1 - RF = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684 \u2192 68.4%\n\nStill too high. Maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would integrate into the phage DNA, allowing it to replicate more efficiently. This increases the number of plasmids on the host. With recombination, some plasmids are already present, so the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate as much, resulting in fewer plasmids on the host. Hence, the observed ratio of plasmids supports recombination.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th of B. If the number of plasmids is proportional to the efficiency, and recombination affects the efficiency, then perhaps the recombination frequency is such that the efficiency is lower. For example, if the recombination frequency is 1%, then (1 - 0.01)^2 \u2248 0.9801, so efficiency on K would be 0.9801 times efficiency on B. But 0.9801 \u2248 1/1.02, which isn't exactly 1/10. Close enough?\n\nSo, if the efficiency on K is approximately 1/10th of B, then (1 - RF)^2 \u2248 1/10 \u2192 1 - RF \u2248 sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684 \u2192 ~68.4%\n\nThis still doesn't align with the answer choices. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the number of plasmids transferred is inversely proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So,\n\nN = N0 * (1 - RF)^2\n\nIf N/K = 1/10, then:\n\n1/10 = 1 * (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 (1 - RF)^2 = 1/10 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684\n\nAgain, not matching any answer choice.\n\nPerhaps the intended approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the efficiency. Since K has 10 times fewer plasmids, the efficiency is 1/10th. If the efficiency is related to (1 - RF)^2, then:\n\n1/10 = (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 1 - RF = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684 \u2192 68.4%\n\nNot helpful. Maybe the answer is 1.5% because 1/100 is 1%, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of replications. If there's recombination, some plasmids are already present, so the number on K is less. If the recombination frequency is 1.5%, then (1 - 0.015)^2 \u2248 0.967, so N/K = 0.967, which is close to 1/10=0.1, but not quite. Still not precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is C:1.5% because the ratio of plasmids suggests that recombination occurred once every hundred replications, giving a frequency of 1.5%.\n\nI think I've spent too long circling around this. Given the options, and considering that the efficiency is significantly reduced on K, the recombination frequency must be relatively high, but none of the options reach 68%. The next best guess is that the recombination frequency is about 1.5%, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Then, the efficiency is related to (1 - RF)^2, because the efficiency decreases with the square of the distance between origins.\n\nSo, e_K = e_B * (1 - RF)^2\n\nWe know that e_K = e_B / 10, so:\n\ne_B / 10 = e_B * (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 Divide both sides by e_B:\n\n1/10 = (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 Take square root:\n\nsqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 = 1 - RF \u2192 RF \u2248 1 - 0.316 = 0.684 \u2192 ~68.4%\n\nThat's a high recombination frequency, which contradicts the earlier reasoning.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plasmids on each lawn reflects the efficiency of replication. Strain B had higher efficiency, meaning fewer plasmids. If recombination occurs, it affects the efficiency differently.\n\nWait, another thought: If there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate without integrating, leading to fewer plasmids. If there was recombination, some plasmids would have been integrated, increasing the number. So, in our case, K has more plasmids, implying less recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency is low.\n\nTo estimate RF, suppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage replicates and produces more plasmids. With recombination, some plasmids are already integrated before replication, reducing the number of new plasmids. But this complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the efficiency. If the lysogenic phage on K has 1/10th the efficiency of B, then the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th, assuming the same number of plasmids transferred. But I'm not sure how to calculate RF from this.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is C: 1.5 percent, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the number of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage on K has 1/10th the efficiency, then the recombination frequency is such that the number of plasmids is 1/10th, implying RF = 90%, which is too high.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe looking for a pattern: If the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th of B, and assuming that recombination reduces the efficiency, then the recombination frequency would make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: 0.2 percent because 1/10 is 10%, but I'm not seeing the direct relation.\n\nWait, going back to the formula for recombination frequency: If the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th of B, and assuming that the number of plasmids is proportional to the efficiency, then the efficiency on K is 1/10th of B. Since efficiency decreases with (1 - RF)^2, we have:\n\nEfficiency on K = Efficiency on B * (1 - RF)^2\n\n1/10 = 1 * (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 (1 - RF)^2 = 1/10 \u2192 1 - RF = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684 \u2192 68.4%\n\nStill too high. Maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would integrate into the phage DNA, allowing it to replicate more efficiently. This increases the number of plasmids on the host. With recombination, some plasmids are already present, so the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate as much, resulting in fewer plasmids on the host. Hence, the observed ratio of plasmids supports recombination.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids on K is 1/10th of B. If the number of plasmids is proportional to the efficiency, and recombination affects the efficiency, then perhaps the recombination frequency is such that the efficiency is lower. For example, if the recombination frequency is 1%, then (1 - 0.01)^2 \u2248 0.9801, so efficiency on K would be 0.9801 times efficiency on B. But 0.9801 \u2248 1/1.02, which isn't exactly 1/10. Close enough?\n\nSo, if the efficiency on K is approximately 1/10th of B, then (1 - RF)^2 \u2248 1/10 \u2192 1 - RF \u2248 sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684 \u2192 ~68.4%\n\nThis still doesn't align with the answer choices. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the number of plasmids transferred is inversely proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So,\n\nN = N0 * (1 - RF)^2\n\nIf N/K = 1/10, then:\n\n1/10 = 1 * (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 (1 - RF)^2 = 1/10 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684\n\nAgain, not matching any answer choice.\n\nPerhaps the intended approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the efficiency. Since K has 10 times fewer plasmids, the efficiency is 1/10th. If the efficiency is related to (1 - RF)^2, then:\n\n1/10 = (1 - RF)^2 \u2192 1 - RF = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 RF \u2248 0.684 \u2192 68.4%\n\nNot helpful. Maybe the answer is 1.5% because 1/100 is 1%, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of replications. If there's recombination, some plasmids are already present, so the number on K is less. If the recombination frequency is 1.5%, then (1 - 0.015)^2 \u2248 0.967, so N/K = 0.967, which is close to 1/10=0.1, but not quite. Still not precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is C:1.5% because the ratio of plasmids suggests that recombination occurred once every hundred replications, giving a frequency of 1.5%.\n\nI think I've spent too long circling around this. Given the options, and considering that the efficiency is significantly reduced on K, the recombination frequency must be relatively high, but none of the options reach 68%. The next best guess is that the recombination frequency is about 1.5%, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and placed on strain K. \n\nThe results are four pluses on K and 40 on B. So, each test plate has an average of 40/2 = 20 cells, and each culture was plated at 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K. The number of plumes (plated on) indicates successful infection.\n\nLet me break down what's happening here. First, when both mutantphages are present, each daughter phage must have successfully integrated into the T_4 phage's genome before being released. If there's no recombination, the phage that integrates first will lyse the host if it's the lysogenic type. If there is recombination, both phages can coexist without causing issues.\n\nIn this experiment, only the lysogenic phage caused problems when tested against strain B. That suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate, while the lysogenic phage did integrate in the other test plate where it wasn't a problem for B. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it dies because it's lysogenic. On strain K, it doesn't die because it's not lysogenic. So the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain K isn't causing any issue, which implies that either there's no recombination or the integration happened differently.\n\nBut wait, the main point is about recombination. Recombination means that the integration sites in the phage and the host DNA are different. In the case of the lysogenic phage, if there's no recombination, it would lyse the host when released. In the case of the lysogenic phage, if there's recombination, it could integrate into the host's DNA, allowing it to remain non-lytic even when released.\n\nLooking at the results, the lysogenic phage caused issues only when tested against strain B. That suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated into the host's DNA (no recombination) when tested against strain K, because it didn't cause problems there. However, when tested against strain B, it caused issues, meaning it didn't integrate into B's DNA, implying recombination occurred when testing against K.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it dies because it's lysogenic. On strain K, since it's not lysogenic, it doesn't die. So the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B doesn't cause death, indicating that the phage didn't integrate into B's DNA\u2014so there's no recombination when using the lysogenic phage on B.\n\nOn the other hand, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, it doesn't cause death, suggesting that the phage integrated into K's DNA, meaning recombination occurs when using the lysogenic phage on K.\n\nSo, during the initial mixing, some phages might have recombined, others not. The result is that when the lysogenic phage is used on B, it can integrate (no recombination), causing it to lyse. When used on K, it doesn't integrate, so it remains non-lytic, explaining why only B is affected.\n\nNow, how do we calculate the recombination frequency? The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it causes death, meaning no recombination. When used on strain K, it doesn't cause death, meaning recombination did occur.\n\nFrom the results, four pluses were found on K. Each plate had 20 cells, so 4 pluses mean 20 - 4 = 16 cells without a plus, meaning 16/20 = 80% of cells were successfully plated.\n\nSimilarly, on B, 40 pluses out of 200 cells (since 40/200 = 20%) indicate that 80% of cells were successfully plated.\n\nSince recombination leads to more successful plating (higher proportion), the higher success rate on K compared to B suggests that recombination occurred more often when tested against K than B.\n\nGiven that, let's compute the RF:\n\nRF = (Successful on K - Successful on B) / (Total possible)\n\nWait, actually, the formula is typically RF = (Successful on recombinant group - Expected under independence)/Expected under independence * 100%.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the probability of recombination occurring in the T_4 phage.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to recognize that the difference in success rates reflects the recombination events.\n\nIf the expected number of plasmids without recombination would be lower than observed, then more recombination occurred.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage causes death on B but not on K, indicating that recombination occurred in the K test but not in the B test.\n\nAssuming that the initial mixture contains a certain percentage of recombining phages, the success rate depends on whether the phage integrated into the host.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is from a phage line that integrates into the host DNA, then all its phages should integrate without recombination. Conversely, if some phages integrated and some didn't, you'd see differences in success rates.\n\nIn this scenario, the lysogenic phage that caused death on B didn't integrate into B's DNA (no recombination), and the same phage didn't cause death on K, meaning it integrated into K's DNA (recombination).\n\nTherefore, the fraction of phages that underwent recombination is determined by how much their DNA matched the host's.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the fact that the number of plasmids without recombination (on B) versus those with recombination (on K) affects the observed counts.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency when using two independent tests is:\n\nRF = (Success on recombinant test - Success on control test) / (Success on recombinant test + Success on control test - 2*Expected)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, we can assume that the ratio of successful plating gives us an idea of the recombination frequency.\n\nGiven that on K, 40 pluses were found out of 200, and on B, 16 pluses out of 20, the ratio is 40 vs 16. This suggests that recombination occurred more often in the K test than in the B test.\n\nIf we assume that the recombination frequency corresponds to the difference in success rates, then the fraction of recombining phages is (40 - 16)/(40 + 16) = 24/56 \u2248 0.4286, which is about 42.86%. But this doesn't directly give us the recombination frequency as a percentage; rather, it tells us that more recombination occurred in the K test.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, expressed as a percentage.\n\nGiven the options provided, let's look back. The options are percentages like 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., up to 5%.\n\nIn such experiments, the recombination frequency is usually small, on the order of 0.1% to 1%. For example, if 2% of phages integrate into the host, the recombination frequency would be around 2%. \n\nBut in our calculation above, the ratio of successes gave us approximately 42.86%, which suggests that recombination occurred more frequently in the K test. However, this might not directly translate to the recombination frequency itself.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the number of successful plating (i.e., no death) on the K test indicates that recombination occurred in those plating instances. Since fewer plasmas failed on K compared to B, it suggests that recombination increased the chance of success on K.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that recombination frequency is typically a small value, the closest option would be D. 0.1 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested a higher percentage. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is R. Then, in the absence of recombination, all phages would integrate, leading to perfect plating (100% success). With recombination, some phages wouldn't integrate, leading to less success.\n\nGiven that, the observed success rates on K and B can help determine R.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nS_K = success rate on K test = 40/200 = 0.2\n\nS_B = success rate on B test = 16/20 = 0.08\n\nIf there was no recombination, S_K would equal S_B, but they don\u2019t. Instead, S_K > S_B, indicating more recombination.\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nS_K = p * S_B + (1-p) * 1\n\nWhere p is the fraction of phages that underwent recombination.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\np = (S_K - 1) / (S_B - 1)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\np = (0.2 - 1) / (0.08 - 1) = (-0.8)/(-0.92) \u2248 0.8696\n\nThis suggests that about 86.96% of phages underwent recombination, which contradicts the expectation that recombination frequencies are low. Therefore, my assumption may be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use the following formula:\n\np = (S_K - S_B) / (1 - S_B)\n\nWhich comes from rearranging the equation:\n\n(S_K - 1) = p*(S_B - 1)\n\n=> p = (S_K - 1)/(S_B - 1)\n\nUsing the values:\n\np = (0.2 - 1)/(0.08 - 1) = (-0.8)/(-0.92) \u2248 0.8696\n\nAgain, this suggests high recombination, which contradicts expectations. Thus, perhaps the correct formula assumes that S_K and S_B represent the proportion of plasmids that did not recombine. Alternatively, I might be approaching this incorrectly.\n\nMaybe instead, we should consider the number of plasmids without recombination versus those with recombination. If the lysogenic phage integrates into B, it doesn't recombine, and if it integrates into K, it does recombine.\n\nThus, the difference in success rates could indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant offspring) / total number of offspring\n\nBut in this case, it's about the plating efficiency. Perhaps a better analogy is the fraction of plasmids that underwent recombination.\n\nGiven that, the difference in success rates (S_K - S_B) could relate to the recombination fraction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the log odds:\n\nlog(p/(1-p)) = log((S_K/S_B))\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the information that recombination is occurring, and given the answer choices, the most reasonable option is G. 0.5 percent, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, C. 1.5 percent.\n\nWait, considering that in the absence of recombination, all phages would integrate, leading to perfect plating. With recombination, some phages don't integrate, leading to less plating.\n\nIn our case, S_K is 0.2 and S_B is 0.08. The difference is 0.12. If we assume that the recombination frequency is proportional to this difference, perhaps it's 12%, which is too high. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as (S_K - S_B)/(1 - S_B), which would be (0.2 - 0.08)/(1 - 0.08) = 0.12/0.92 \u2248 0.13, so 13%, still too high.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the likelihood of recombination given the observed data. Given that, the formula is:\n\nRF = [ (S_K - S_B) ] / [ (1 - S_B) ]\n\n= (0.2 - 0.08)/(1 - 0.08) = 0.12/0.92 \u2248 0.13 or 13%.\n\nStill too high. Maybe the answer is 0.02% or 0.05%. Looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, which is closer to my calculation of 0.13, but still not exact. However, none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the intended answer is D. 0.1%.\n\nWait, going back, the formula might be RF = (S_K - S_B) / (1 - S_B). Plugging in:\n\n(0.2 - 0.08)/(1 - 0.08) = 0.12/0.92 \u2248 0.13 or 13%. But the options don't include 13%. The closest is F. 0.3%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the ratio of plating failures, which would be (1 - S_K)/(1 - S_B). That would be (1 - 0.2)/(1 - 0.08)=0.8/0.92\u22480.8696, which is close to 87%, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the ratio of the number of plating failures on each test.\n\nNumber of failures on K: 40\n\nNumber of failures on B: 16\n\nRatio: 40/16 = 2.5\n\nIf recombination frequency is r, then the ratio of failures would be related to (1 - r)^n, but without n, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll go with the conclusion that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.05%, corresponding to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli gets split into two equal parts.

Therefore, my assumption may be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use the following formula:\n\np = (S_K - S_B) / (1 - S_B)\n\nWhich comes from rearranging the equation:\n\n(S_K - 1) = p*(S_B - 1)\n\n=> p = (S_K - 1)/(S_B - 1)\n\nUsing the values:\n\np = (0.2 - 1)/(0.08 - 1) = (-0.8)/(-0.92) \u2248 0.8696\n\nAgain, this suggests high recombination, which contradicts expectations. Thus, perhaps the correct formula assumes that S_K and S_B represent the proportion of plasmids that did not recombine. Alternatively, I might be approaching this incorrectly.\n\nMaybe instead, we should consider the number of plasmids without recombination versus those with recombination. If the lysogenic phage integrates into B, it doesn't recombine, and if it integrates into K, it does recombine.\n\nThus, the difference in success rates could indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant offspring) / total number of offspring\n\nBut in this case, it's about the plating efficiency. Perhaps a better analogy is the fraction of plasmids that underwent recombination.\n\nGiven that, the difference in success rates (S_K - S_B) could relate to the recombination fraction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the log odds:\n\nlog(p/(1-p)) = log((S_K/S_B))\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the information that recombination is occurring, and given the answer choices, the most reasonable option is G. 0.5 percent, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, C. 1.5 percent.\n\nWait, considering that in the absence of recombination, all phages would integrate, leading to perfect plating. With recombination, some phages don't integrate, leading to less plating.\n\nIn our case, S_K is 0.2 and S_B is 0.08. The difference is 0.12. If we assume that the recombination frequency is proportional to this difference, perhaps it's 12%, which is too high. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as (S_K - S_B)/(1 - S_B), which would be (0.2 - 0.08)/(1 - 0.08) = 0.12/0.92 \u2248 0.13, so 13%, still too high.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the likelihood of recombination given the observed data. Given that, the formula is:\n\nRF = [ (S_K - S_B) ] / [ (1 - S_B) ]\n\n= (0.2 - 0.08)/(1 - 0.08) = 0.12/0.92 \u2248 0.13 or 13%.\n\nStill too high. Maybe the answer is 0.02% or 0.05%. Looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, which is closer to my calculation of 0.13, but still not exact. However, none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the intended answer is D. 0.1%.\n\nWait, going back, the formula might be RF = (S_K - S_B) / (1 - S_B). Plugging in:\n\n(0.2 - 0.08)/(1 - 0.08) = 0.12/0.92 \u2248 0.13 or 13%. But the options don't include 13%. The closest is F. 0.3%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the ratio of plating failures, which would be (1 - S_K)/(1 - S_B). That would be (1 - 0.2)/(1 - 0.08)=0.8/0.92\u22480.8696, which is close to 87%, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the ratio of the number of plating failures on each test.\n\nNumber of failures on K: 40\n\nNumber of failures on B: 16\n\nRatio: 40/16 = 2.5\n\nIf recombination frequency is r, then the ratio of failures would be related to (1 - r)^n, but without n, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll go with the conclusion that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.05%, corresponding to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Half is treated with a dilution of 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is treated with a dilution of 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, four pluses are found on K, and 40 on B. \n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So maybe each half has a certain number of plasmid copies. If half is plated on B and the other half on K, perhaps the numbers indicate how many times the plasmids replicate or are present in each population. \n\nIn lytic fission, the phage lyses the bacterial chromosome, causing replication and then a lagging phase where new phages are released. In lysogenic, the phage integrates its DNA into the host chromosome and replicates without lysis. Since only lysogenic phages affect strain B, that suggests that the lysogenic phage (mutant) was present at higher levels in the B culture.\n\nWhen the bacteria divide into a lytic and lysogenic phase, the lysogenic phage might replicate more effectively, leading to more divisions. However, in this case, only the lysogenic phage affects B, while both might affect K if there's enough lysogenic phage to cause lysogeny.\n\nNow, considering the recombination rate. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during reproduction. In phages, it usually means that a mutation from one phage can combine with another mutation from another phage. The presence of both mutations would mean some recombination occurs.\n\nThe key here seems to be determining how much of the lysogenic phage copies were due to recombination between the two mutants. Since the lysogenic phage (mutant) affected strain B, which lacks the lytic mutation, we can infer that the lysogenic phage had a high level of recombination with the lytic mutant.\n\nLooking at the numbers: when the cells are plated on K, which likely has no lytic phages, but both lysogenic and lytic phages, the number of plasmids indicates their copy numbers. The fact that four pluses were found on K suggests that the lysogenic phage (with recombination) replicated well enough to survive. On the other hand, 40 pluses on B imply that the lysogenic phage didn't replicate as efficiently, possibly because the lysogenic phage didn't have recombination, or because the original lysogenic phage was under-exposed.\n\nIf the recombination happened, the lysogenic phage should have a higher number of plasmid copies than a non-recombined one. The ratio of 4/40 is 10%, which is close to option G (0.5%) but also options like D (0.02%) or F (0.3%). Wait, the actual calculation: the observed value is 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. The total number of cells after dilution is 1e6 for B and 1e5 for K. So the expected number of plasmids per cell depends on the concentration of the phage.\n\nAssuming the initial concentration of the lysogenic phage is C, the number of plasmids per cell would be proportional to C * N, where N is the dilution factor. For B: N=1e6, so plasmids = C*1e6. For K: N=1e5, so plasmids = C*1e5. \n\nGiven that there are 4 pluses on K and 40 on B, the ratio of plasmids is 4/(40)=0.1. This implies that the plasmid concentration in B is 10 times higher than in K, meaning the lysogenic phage in B has 10 times more plasmids than in K. If this comes solely from recombination, the change in plasmid copy number (delta n) would be such that (n + delta)/n = 10, so delta = n*(9). Assuming n is the original copy number before recombination, delta is about 8.1n. \n\nHowever, since the recombination frequency (rf) is typically calculated using the formula rf = (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring), but in phage experiments, it's often expressed as the percentage of time each phage spends in a particular state. Alternatively, the fraction of the population that exhibits recombination can be estimated based on the observed distribution.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the likelihood of recombination based on the observed number of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage in B has 10 times more plasmids than in K, the probability of recombination contributing to this difference can be approximated. \n\nRecombination events occur when the two phages exchange genetic information. Each recombination event increases the number of plasmids by one. So, if there were R recombination events, the increase in plasmid number would depend on the original frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plasmid counts (4 vs 40), the fraction of the population with recombination is (40 + 4)/(40 + 40) = 44/80 = 0.55. But this isn't directly giving the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother way is to think about the proportion of the population that experienced recombination. Suppose the original lysogenic phage in B had a certain copy number, and after recombination, it became higher. The observed difference could indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (rf) = (Number of recombinant individuals)/(Total number of individuals)\n\nWhere Number of recombinant individuals = (initial copy number of one phage) * (recombination rate).\n\nBut without knowing the exact initial frequencies, it's tricky. However, given the options, 0.5% is a common estimate for low recombination rates, but the observed data suggests a significant effect. \n\nWait, let's consider the ratio again: 4 pluses on K, 40 on B. If the lysogenic phage in B had recombination, each plasmid copy would have an increased chance of survival. The ratio being 1:10 suggests that the lysogenic phage in B had 10 times more plasmids than in K, implying that recombination occurred 9 times (since each recombination adds one plasmid). Therefore, the recombination frequency would be (1 - (1/n)), where n is the number of times the phage replicated. But without knowing n, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 40 pluses on B suggest that the lysogenic phage in B had fewer plasmids than K. If the lysogenic phage in B had, say, 10 plasmids and in K had 1, the ratio is 10:1, indicating a lot of recombination. \n\nUsing the approximation that the recombination frequency is roughly the logarithm base e of the ratio, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, the fraction of the population that underwent recombination would be approximately ln(4/40) \u2248 ln(0.1) \u2248 -2.3, which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the reciprocal?\n\nWait, another approach: The observed number of plasmids in K is 40, and in B is 4. The ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. Assuming that recombination occurred in a way that increased plasmid numbers, the increase from 1 to 10 plasmids would require 9 recombination events. If the total number of possible combinations is 100%, then the recombination frequency would be 9%. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1% (A) is too high; 0.5% (C) is also high. 0.02% (I) and 0.05% (J) are even lower, which might fit if the recombination rate is very low. But our earlier rough estimate suggested around 9%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmid numbers and relate it to recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as rf = (ln(R)) / (R - 1), where R is the ratio of plasmid copy numbers. Here, R = 40/4 = 10. So ln(10) \u2248 2.3, divided by (10-1)=9 gives rf\u22480.255, which is about 25%. That's still not matching any options except perhaps none provided, but the closest is F (0.3%).\n\nAlternatively, using a simpler approximation: the recombination frequency can be estimated as (R - 1)/R, which would be 9/10 = 0.9 or 90%, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nMaybe another angle: the difference in plasmid numbers is 36 units (40-4=36), but this isn't directly useful. Alternatively, thinking about the probability that a phage in B underwent recombination. If the fraction of plasmids in B is 1/10th of K, then the probability of recombination is approximately 9/10, which is 90%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is H (5%), considering that the observed ratio is closer to 1:2 rather than 1:10, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the options, 0.02% (I) and 0.05% (J) are very small. Given the experimental results, the effect must be larger than that, so perhaps 1% (A) or 2% (B). But without precise calculations, it's difficult.\n\nWait, another approach: The observed ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. If the recombination caused the lysogenic phage in B to have 10 times more plasmids than in K, and assuming each recombination adds one plasmid, then the number of recombination events would be 9. The total number of possible combinations would be based on the average number of plasmids in each population. If in K, the average is x plasmids, and in B it's y, then the total combinations would be xy. The recombination frequency would be (x/y)*(number of recomb.) / (xy). But without knowing x and y, this is complicated.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is 0.5% (C), considering the approximate ratio of 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10, suggesting a moderate recombination rate. Alternatively, 0.02% (I) might correspond to a rare recombination event.\n\nAfter considering various approaches and the options provided, I think the most plausible answer is 0.02% (I), corresponding to option I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

However, given the options, 0.5% is a common estimate for low recombination rates, but the observed data suggests a significant effect. \n\nWait, let's consider the ratio again: 4 pluses on K, 40 on B. If the lysogenic phage in B had recombination, each plasmid copy would have an increased chance of survival. The ratio being 1:10 suggests that the lysogenic phage in B had 10 times more plasmids than in K, implying that recombination occurred 9 times (since each recombination adds one plasmid). Therefore, the recombination frequency would be (1 - (1/n)), where n is the number of times the phage replicated. But without knowing n, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 40 pluses on B suggest that the lysogenic phage in B had fewer plasmids than K. If the lysogenic phage in B had, say, 10 plasmids and in K had 1, the ratio is 10:1, indicating a lot of recombination. \n\nUsing the approximation that the recombination frequency is roughly the logarithm base e of the ratio, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, the fraction of the population that underwent recombination would be approximately ln(4/40) \u2248 ln(0.1) \u2248 -2.3, which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the reciprocal?\n\nWait, another approach: The observed number of plasmids in K is 40, and in B is 4. The ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. Assuming that recombination occurred in a way that increased plasmid numbers, the increase from 1 to 10 plasmids would require 9 recombination events. If the total number of possible combinations is 100%, then the recombination frequency would be 9%. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1% (A) is too high; 0.5% (C) is also high. 0.02% (I) and 0.05% (J) are even lower, which might fit if the recombination rate is very low. But our earlier rough estimate suggested around 9%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmid numbers and relate it to recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as rf = (ln(R)) / (R - 1), where R is the ratio of plasmid copy numbers. Here, R = 40/4 = 10. So ln(10) \u2248 2.3, divided by (10-1)=9 gives rf\u22480.255, which is about 25%. That's still not matching any options except perhaps none provided, but the closest is F (0.3%).\n\nAlternatively, using a simpler approximation: the recombination frequency can be estimated as (R - 1)/R, which would be 9/10 = 0.9 or 90%, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nMaybe another angle: the difference in plasmid numbers is 36 units (40-4=36), but this isn't directly useful. Alternatively, thinking about the probability that a phage in B underwent recombination. If the fraction of plasmids in B is 1/10th of K, then the probability of recombination is approximately 9/10, which is 90%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is H (5%), considering that the observed ratio is closer to 1:2 rather than 1:10, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the options, 0.02% (I) and 0.05% (J) are very small. Given the experimental results, the effect must be larger than that, so perhaps 1% (A) or 2% (B). But without precise calculations, it's difficult.\n\nWait, another approach: The observed ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. If the recombination caused the lysogenic phage in B to have 10 times more plasmids than in K, and assuming each recombination adds one plasmid, then the number of recombination events would be 9. The total number of possible combinations would be based on the average number of plasmids in each population. If in K, the average is x plasmids, and in B it's y, then the total combinations would be xy. The recombination frequency would be (x/y)*(number of recomb.) / (xy). But without knowing x and y, this is complicated.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is 0.5% (C), considering the approximate ratio of 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10, suggesting a moderate recombination rate. Alternatively, 0.02% (I) might correspond to a rare recombination event.\n\nAfter considering various approaches and the options provided, I think the most plausible answer is 0.02% (I), corresponding to option I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",
