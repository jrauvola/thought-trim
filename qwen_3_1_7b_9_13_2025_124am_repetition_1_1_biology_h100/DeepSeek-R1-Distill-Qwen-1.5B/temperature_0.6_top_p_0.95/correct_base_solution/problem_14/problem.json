  "problem": "T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII cancause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK. A plate of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultinglysateis divided inhalf. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strainB. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B. Determine the amount of recombination between the two mutationsin this region of the T_4 genome.\n\nA. 1 percent\n\nB. 2 percent\n\nC. 1.5 percent\n\nD. 0.1 percent\n\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nF. 0.3 percent\n\nG. 0.5 percent\n\nH. 5 percent\n\nI. 0.02 percent\n\nJ. 0.05 percent",
