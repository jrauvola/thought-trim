After conjugation, the female becomes a male. Account for this \"sexchange\".\n\nA. The female bacterium becomes a male as a result of nutrient deficiency\n\nB. The female becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor\n\nC. The female bacterium becomes a male through the process of osmosis\n\nD. The female bacterium becomes a male through gene mutation\n\nE. The female bacterium becomes a male after receiving multiple copies of non-F factor genes\n\nF. The female bacterium becomes a male through binary fission\n\nG. The female bacterium becomes a male by incorporating a plasmid unrelated to the F factor\n\nH. The female bacterium becomes a male after exposure to antibiotics\n\nI. The female bacterium becomes a male due to a viral infection\n\nJ. The female bacterium becomes a male due to environmental factors\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why a male bacterium can conjugate and become a female, while a female bacterium can conjugate and become male too. Hmm, I remember that conjugation is a type of sexual reproduction in bacteria. It involves two cells merging into one, but there's something about exchanging factors.\n\nWait, when bacteria conjugate, they exchange a factor called the F factor, right? So if the mother has an F factor, it might help the father get it from the father. But what happens during conjugation? I think the process doesn't just involve getting the F factor; maybe it's more about exchanging some parts of their genetic material or something else.\n\nOh, I remember now! During conjugation, each cell releases a plasmid. These plasmids carry either the F factor (if the bacteria are conjugative) or other genes. When the two bacteria come together, they exchange these plasmids. So the original bacteria loses its own plasmid and gains the new one from the partner, which could be the F factor. This results in one becoming a sex chromosome and the other losing it.\n\nLooking at the options, option B says the female receives one copy of the F factor. That makes sense because if the mother already had the F factor, she would give one to her offspring, making them males. Conversely, if the father had the F factor, he'd give it to the daughter. So B seems correct.\n\nOther options don't fit well. For example, C talks about osmosis, which isn't part of bacterial conjugation. D is about gene mutation, which isn't involved here. E and F are about antibiotics and viruses, neither relevant to how the F factor works. G is about plasmids, which is true but not the primary reason. H is about antibiotics again, irrelevant. J and I are about environmental factors, also not related. Finally, K isn't even listed.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
