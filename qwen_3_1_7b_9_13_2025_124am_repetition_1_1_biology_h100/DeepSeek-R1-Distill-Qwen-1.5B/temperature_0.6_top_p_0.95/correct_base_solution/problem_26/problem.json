However, no metamorphosis takes place if the head is cut off, even though the larva continues to live. Explain.\n\nA. The gland in the thorax is the only gland involved, but it requires a signal from the head to start metamorphosis.\n\nB. Only the gland in the head is necessary for metamorphosis.\n\nC. The gland in the head secretes a different hormone necessary for the initiation of the metamorphosis process.\n\nD. The gland in the thorax secretes the hormone, but the head must be present to activate it.\n\nE. Metamorphosis is triggered by environmental factors, not by hormones secreted by glands.\n\nF. Metamorphosis is controlled by a gland in the abdomen, not the thorax or the head.\n\nG. The head contains an inhibitor that prevents the gland in the thorax from inducing metamorphosis.\n\nH. Neither the gland in the head nor the gland in the thorax are necessary for metamorphosis.\n\nI. Both the gland in the head and the gland in the thorax of the cecropia moth are necessary for the process of metamorphosis.\n\nJ. Only the gland in the thorax is necessary for metamorphosis.",
