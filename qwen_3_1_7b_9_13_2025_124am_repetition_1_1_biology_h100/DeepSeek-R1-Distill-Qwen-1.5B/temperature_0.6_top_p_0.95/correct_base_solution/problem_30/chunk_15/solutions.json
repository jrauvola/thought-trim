Evolution is the process by which species change over generations, right? It's usually attributed to natural selection, where organisms better adapted to their environment pass on those traits to their offspring. Looking at the options: A says it's a universal fact about all species' origins and development. That sounds too broad because not everything has evolved yet; many are still forming. B suggests it's a hypothesis being tested. I think evolution isn't just a hypothesis; it's been extensively tested through various experiments and evidence. C claims it's disproven, but nope, evolution is well-established and widely accepted. D talks about speculating about population changes, but evolution doesn't predict future changes\u2014it explains past ones. E is an opinion held by scientists, but evolution is more than just science; it's widely accepted as true across many fields. F seems correct.
