  "problem": "Describe the evolution of the reptilian excretory system to account for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat.\n\nA. The excretory system includes a secondary bladder for water storage.\n\nB. The reptilian excretory system has evolved to excrete more water\n\nC. Reptiles have evolved to have a smooth, wet skin\n\nD. Reptiles have evolved to excrete nitrogenous wastes primarily as ammonia to conserve water.\n\nE. Reptiles have developed larger glomeruli to increase water retention.\n\nF. The excretory system has adapted to increase salt excretion to facilitate life in marine environments.\n\nG. Reptilian kidneys have evolved to produce ammonia directly for more efficient water use.\n\nH. Reptiles excrete nitrogenous wastes as urea\n\nI. The excretory system has evolved a complex series of ducts to recycle water back into the body.\n\nJ. The reptilian excretory system has evolved to conserve most of its water with modifications like a coarse, dry, horny skin, decreased size of glomeruli, greater reabsorption of water from glomerular filtrate, and excretion of nitrogenous wastes as uric acid.",
