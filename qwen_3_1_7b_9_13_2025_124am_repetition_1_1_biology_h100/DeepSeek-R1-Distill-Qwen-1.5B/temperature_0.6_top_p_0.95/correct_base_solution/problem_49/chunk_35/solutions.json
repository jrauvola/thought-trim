    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about embryology. Let me break it down slowly because I'm still learning. The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad.",

The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Identical features only in fetus. From the zygote onwards, perhaps, but I'm not sure. J: Features identical to adult fish and birds. Only in the fetus, which makes sense because they differ in\u53d1\u80b2. So putting it together, the most likely correct answers are D/G, F, and J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad.",

A vertebrate organism develops identical features of its class, order, and species only during the fetus stage.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to answer this question about embryology. Let me break it down slowly because I'm still learning. The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Identical in class, order, species. Only during the fetus. Well, species vary across classes and orders. So I might be incorrect. J: Features identical to adult fish and avians only in the fetus. That can't be right because development includes various stages beyond just matching adult forms. So, putting it together, the most likely correct answer is D or G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to answer this question about embryology. Let me break it down slowly because I'm still learning. The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Identical features only in the fetus. No, zygotes also have unique features before reaching the fetus. J: Features identical only in the fetus. Also incorrect because the zygote stage has unique elements. So among the options, D and G are the strongest candidates. Between them, D says \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\" which refers to the sequence of development mirroring the ancestry.

The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern.

The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults.

C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences.

Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Features identical to adults. Well, the fetus shares some similarities, but not necessarily identical in all aspects. J: Identical up to adult stages. I think that's incorrect because while some structures repeat, others diverge. So, putting it together, the correct answers are D and G, which are the same statement. Since the user wants a single letter, the key point here is that onto the life cycle recapitates phylogeny, which is D or G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to answer this question about embryology. Let me break it down slowly because I'm still learning. The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. J: Identical to fish and avians entirely. Definitely false. I: Human embryo shares features with fish and birds throughout development. That aligns with E and F but is too narrow. So putting it together, D and G are likely correct because they address the reciprocal relationship between development and ancestry, which is a key concept in embryology.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic.

The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad.",

C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Same as fish and birds throughout development. No, development varies; some humans may look like humans but others might not. J: Identical features only in the fetus.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to answer this question about embryology. Let me break it down slowly because I'm still learning. The question is asking what conclusion an embryologist would draw when looking at how a vertebrate organizes itself from the zygote stage (when a fertilized egg splits) to the fetus stage. The options are labeled A through J, each making a different statement. First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Identical features only in the fetus. Incorrect because some similarities exist earlier, even in the zygote. J: Same features as fish and birds only in the fetus. Also incorrect. So putting it together, D and G are likely correct, but since I can only choose one letter, maybe D is sufficient.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let's start with B: \"The development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus displays a random pattern of evolutionary history.\" Hmm, I remember that embryology often shows patterns based on genetics and environmental factors rather than just randomness. So maybe B isn't correct. Option D says, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Wait, onto the life cycle? Reciprocating? I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad.",

I think that means the sequence of development mirrors the ancestry, so if you go from the egg to the fetus, it's like tracing back through generations. That sounds right because organisms' developmental stages mirror their evolutionary origins. Option G is another version of D, phrased differently. So both D and G seem related. Now, thinking about the basics: embryology studies the development of organisms from their zygote stage. It involves understanding how organs form, growth, and function as they mature into adults. There are known patterns such as the zygote being similar to the blastocyst, and as they develop, certain structures emerge. Looking at the options again: A: Doesn't follow a consistent pattern. But I know there are consistent patterns, especially ones influenced by genetics and environment. So probably wrong. B: Random evolution. I don't think that's accurate; patterns are more systematic. C: Zygote identical to fetus. No, they're very similar but not exactly identical. Fetal stages have specific features due to maturation. D/G: Reciprocation of development and evolution. Yes, the development of an organism's body parts mirrors its parent's ancestors, meaning onto the life cycle corresponds to ancestor traits. So this seems correct. E: Identical features without species. That doesn't make sense because species require distinct traits. Early embryos might share some features but lack species-specific differences. F: Early humans share features with others. That's true for many aspects, but it's not universal or proven. H: Human embryo matches fish and birds. Not all humans match these, so H is too broad. I: Human embryo matches adult fish and birds. Some similarities exist, but not universal. J: Identical features only in the fetus. But zygotes also show similar features before birth. So J is incorrect. Therefore, the best answer should be D or G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
