    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about why milk gets \"spilled\" when kept in a refrigerator. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing.",

    "rollout": " Option D is mesophiles. Mesophiles are species of bacteria that live between psychrophiles (cold) and thermophiles (hot). They might be involved in metabolism, but I'm not sure how that directly leads to the spill. Option F is acidification from light.

Thermophiles thrive in hot environments.

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids.

Light can sometimes affect bacteria indirectly, maybe through UV light, but I don't recall milk specifically being affected by light in this way. Option I says chemical reactions. While bacteria can break down substances chemically, the main issue here seems to be the bacteria themselves, not necessarily chemical reactions per se. Option J is contamination from other foods. This could happen, but the question is asking why milk spills when kept cold, not just due to external contamination. Option K isn't listed here, so I'll skip it.\n\nPutting it all together, the most plausible answer seems to be G, psychrophiles. They're attracted to the cold in the refrigerator, leading them to break down parts of the milk, increasing its density and causing it to spill. The other options either relate to different processes (like mesophiles) or factors unrelated to the immediate cause of the spill.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids.

This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing. Option D mentions mesophiles, which are intermediate bacteria between psychrophiles (cold) and endotherms (heat). I'm not sure how relevant that is here, but it's possible. Option F is acidification due to exposure to light. As mentioned before, I don't see a direct link there. Option J is contamination from other foods. While contamination can cause spills, it's not specific to the action happening inside the refrigerator. Option I is chemical reactions. There are various chemical processes in food storage, like osmolytic effects (salt used to break down lactose), but the main cause here seems more bacterial activity rather than general chemical reactions. So putting it all together, the most likely answer is psychrophiles, which are bacteria that prefer cold temperatures. Their activity would lead to bacterial breakdown of milk components, increasing density and causing it to spill.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew.

While light can sometimes cause mildew, I'm not sure if that's the main factor here. Option I says chemical reactions. Well, some bacteria can break down lactose into glucose and ethanol, releasing ethanol which can cause mildew. That's another possible reason for the spill, but it's still more related to the bacteria's action rather than the overall issue of why the milk gets spilled. Lastly, option J is contamination from other foods. While contamination can cause spills, the question seems to focus more on the bacterial activity within the milk rather than external contaminants. So putting it all together, the most likely answer is psychrophiles (option G) because they thrive at cold temperatures and use them to degrade lactose, increasing the density and causing boiling.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Thermophiles live at high temperatures and wouldn't be present in a cold refrigerator, so that's unlikely. Option C, loss of refrigeration power, is still partially correct because if the fridge isn't working well, the cold duration is shorter, making it harder for the bacteria to act. So between G and C, psychrophiles being the bacteria that break down milk is the main reason for the spill, while the fridge losing power isn't the immediate cause.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing.",

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids.

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about why milk gets \"spilled\" when kept in a refrigerator. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing. Option D, mesophiles, are different from psychrophiles; mesophiles are found between psychrophiles and thermophiles. They live in moderate temperatures and convert water into ice. They wouldn't necessarily cause a spill in cold environments. Option F is about acidification from light. Again, while light can affect some bacteria, the main issue here is bacterial activity rather than light. Option I says chemical reactions. While bacteria can cause chemical changes, I'm not sure that's the primary cause of the spill. The main factor seems to be the presence of psychrophiles in the milk. \n\nSo putting it all together, the best answer seems to be G, psychrophiles.

That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing. Option D is mesophiles, which are intermediate phase bacteria between thermophiles (like at high temps) and psychrophiles. But again, the main issue here is bacteria activity, not specific types of bacteria. Option F is acidification from light. Light doesn't directly cause acids in milk; it's more about UV light that can oxidize some compounds. Option I is chemical reactions. While bacteria can break down lactose into glucose and ethanol, that's more of a biochemical reaction. But the question is asking why it spills, which points more to bacterial activity than specific chemical reactions. So putting it all together, the most likely reason is that psychrophiles are attracted to the cold temperature in the refrigerator, leading them to break down parts of the milk and potentially causing it to boil.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing. Option D is mesophiles, which are intermediate bacteria between psychrophiles (cold) and thermofriends (hot). Maybe they're involved, but again, the main issue is bacterial action. Option F is acidification from light. As I thought earlier, this doesn't fit. Option J is contamination from other foods. While contaminants can cause spills, the question seems to focus on the natural behavior of the milk itself, not external factors. Option I is chemical reactions, which could happen, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason for the spill. Option H is thermophiles, which thrive at high temperatures. The fridge is cooling them, but the main issue isn't their growth; it's the bacteria acting on the milk. \n\nPutting it all together, the most likely answer is G, psychrophiles. Because the cold environment attracts these bacteria, leading to their activity and potentially breaking down lactose, causing the milk to become too dense and spill.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about why milk gets \"spilled\" when kept in a refrigerator. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about why milk gets \"spilled\" when kept in a refrigerator. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing. Option D is mesophiles. Mesophiles are intermediate phase organisms between psychrophiles (cold) and thermophiles (hot). They live in environments where both conditions aren't extreme.

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill.

These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing.",

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold.

First, I know that milk is made up of lactose and proteins. When you keep it cold, the bacteria in the milk might become active because they're looking for a cool environment to grow. These bacteria could be psychrophiles, which means they thrive at or near low temperatures. So, maybe something's reacting with the cold. Looking at the options, option G mentions psychrophiles. That makes sense because psychrophiles are attracted to cold, right? So when the milk is kept cold, these bacteria might start breaking down some components of milk. They might do this to make more lactose available, which would then increase the density of the milk above the freezing point, causing it to boil and spill. Another thought is option C, loss of refrigeration power. But wait, refrigeration power usually refers to how well the fridge keeps things cold. If the fridge isn't working as efficiently, the cold might not last long enough for the bacteria to act on the milk. Plus, even if it did work, the main issue seems more related to the bacteria's activity rather than the fridge's capacity to maintain cold. Option E talks about acidification due to exposure to light. Milk doesn't get much light, but sometimes exposure can cause mildew. However, I think the primary problem here is bacterial activity, not light-induced issues like mildew. Option A is about enzymatic reactions with oxygen. Enzymes usually need an acid catalyst. I don't remember milk specifically needing oxygen for bacterial growth, especially since it's already a dairy product. Plus, the question is about what causes the spill, not just breakdown products. Option B is lactose crystallization. That process requires heat, typically around 100\u00b0C, to separate solid crystals from liquids. This doesn't seem relevant to keeping milk cold where the bacteria should be growing.",
