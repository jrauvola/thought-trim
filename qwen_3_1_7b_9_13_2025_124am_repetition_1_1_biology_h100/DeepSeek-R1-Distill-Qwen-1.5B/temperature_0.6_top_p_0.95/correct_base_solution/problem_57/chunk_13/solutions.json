Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, option G mentions that amino acid sequences are influenced by environment, which might be part of the broader concept but not directly showing that genes control them. Option J talks about uniformity across all species, which could imply genetic control since similar structures suggest shared ancestry. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Another approach is to recall that the ribosome experiment showed that missing a gene causes a problem, meaning that the gene influences the amino acid sequence. So the evidence would support that genes do control them. Therefore, option E might be referring to the effect of mutation on the protein sequence, while option J points more towards the biological implication that genes influence them.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, another experiment comes to mind with the yeast two-hybrid system, where disrupting gene function leads to misproteination. But none of those are directly listed here. Another angle: the discovery that enzymes bind amino acids in a way controlled by the gene, meaning the gene dictates the binding sites. That would tie into option B or D. Option B is about observing genes attach amino acids to protein chains. If you can see that in living cells, that would be direct evidence. Similarly, option D talks about removing genes affecting amino acid sequences. If removing a gene disrupts the sequence, that's also evidence. However, I'm not sure if any of these are standard answers. From my studies, the most common example is the ribosome experiment, where mutations in a gene lead to errors. So maybe E is closer, even though it's about mutation effects rather than direct gene attachment. Or perhaps option C states that genes don't control amino acids, which is the opposite of what we're looking for. Option G says amino acid sequences are determined by environment, which contradicts the question. Option F mentions identical sequences in unrelated species, which points towards a genetic cause, but that might be part of the broader theory but not the direct evidence. Option I is about ribosomal malfunction causing same amino acids elsewhere, which again relates to gene impact on protein structure. Among these, E seems to fit as the mutation aspect, which is a type of evidence supporting gene control.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Without it, ribosomes can't form, so the resulting proteins don't have the right amino acids. This would show that the gene directly influences the protein sequence. So maybe option G or H? Option G says amino acid sequences are determined by environmental factors, which seems less likely since many studies point to genes. Option H talks about laboratory conditions without genetic material, which aligns with the ribosome example. If I'm thinking about experiments where removing a gene leads to altered protein sequences, then option E might be pointing towards that. But wait, E specifically mentions mutation, not just removal. Perhaps the best fit is option G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option F, as it states identical sequences in unrelated proteins suggest control, but that's more of an empirical observation rather than direct evidence of gene control. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to recall. The classic experiment was that ribosomal proteins depend on specific genes. When you delete the rRNA gene, ribosomes can't form, so the resulting proteins have incorrect amino acid sequences. This showed that the gene directly controls the protein sequence. So the correct answer should relate to the gene affecting the amino acid sequences, leading to a failure in proper protein formation. Among the options, E mentions mutation causing mismatches, which is part of it, but maybe the strongest evidence comes from the successful replication without the gene, showing a direct effect. But looking back, the initial prompt is about \"experimental evidence,\" and the most direct evidence is probably the ribosome experiment, which is shown through mutation effects. However, none of the options exactly state that. Alternatively, option G says amino acid sequences are determined by environmental factors, which is incorrect because genes do play a role. Option H is about laboratory conditions without genetic material, which also relates to the ribosome experiment. Option B is about observing genes attaching amino acids to proteins in live cells, which sounds like a biochemical approach, perhaps involving biotin-labeled amino acids and seeing how proteins bind them. That could provide direct evidence of interaction. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the question asks for evidence that genes control amino acid sequences. In the ribosome experiment, mutations in the gene lead to faulty protein folding. So that's a strong piece of evidence supporting direct control. Since the user provided multiple options, I need to choose the one that best fits this scenario. I think the correct answer is E, but I'm still uncertain because E speaks about mutation effects rather than direct gene control. Alternatively, maybe option C is incorrect, and the correct choice is D. Wait, no, the question is about evidence indicating that genes control amino acid sequences. Option D is about removing genes not affecting sequences, which is more observational than experimental. Option F is about identical sequences in unrelated proteins, which supports a genetic cause but not necessarily direct evidence. Option G is wrong. Option H is about the synthesis without genetic material, which ties into the ribosome experiment. Option I is about ribosome malfunction producing same sequences elsewhere, which again points to gene control. So among the options, E and I both relate to gene effects, but E is more about mutation-induced issues, while I is about replication in different proteins. Between those, I think E is better because it shows that altering the gene affects the protein, demonstrating its control.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, another experiment I recall is the discovery that the rRNA gene encodes the structure necessary for ribosome assembly. Without it, ribosomes can't form, so the resulting proteins don't have the right amino acids. This would show that the gene directly influences the protein sequence. So maybe option G or H? Option G says amino acid sequences are determined by environmental factors, which seems less likely since many studies point to genes. Option H talks about laboratory conditions without genetic material, which aligns with the ribosome example. If I'm thinking about experiments where removing a gene leads to altered protein sequences, then option E might be pointing towards that. But wait, E specifically mentions mutation, not just removal. Perhaps the best fit is option G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option F, as it states identical sequences in unrelated proteins suggest control, but that's more of an empirical observation rather than direct evidence of gene control. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to recall. The classic experiment was that ribosomal proteins depend on specific genes. When you delete the rRNA gene, ribosomes can't form, so the resulting proteins have incorrect amino acid sequences. This showed that the gene directly controls the protein sequence. So the correct answer should relate to the gene affecting the amino acid sequences, leading to a failure in proper protein formation. Among the options, E mentions mutation causing mismatches, which is part of it, but maybe the strongest evidence comes from the successful replication without the gene, showing a direct effect. But looking back, the initial prompt is about \"experimental evidence,\" and the most direct evidence is probably the ribosome experiment, which is shown through mutation effects. However, none of the options exactly state that. Alternatively, option G says amino acid sequences are determined by environmental factors, which is incorrect because genes do play a role. Option H is about laboratory conditions without genetic material, which also relates to the ribosome experiment. Option B is about observing genes attaching amino acids to proteins in live cells, which sounds like a biochemical approach, perhaps involving biotin-labeled amino acids and seeing how proteins bind them. That could provide direct evidence of interaction. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the question asks for evidence that genes control amino acid sequences. In the ribosome experiment, mutations in the gene lead to faulty protein folding. So that's a strong piece of evidence supporting direct control. Since the user provided multiple options, I need to choose the one that best fits this scenario. I think the correct answer is E, but I'm still uncertain because E speaks about mutation effects rather than direct gene control. Alternatively, maybe option C is incorrect, and the correct choice is D. Wait, no, the question is about evidence indicating that genes control amino acid sequences. Option D is about removing genes not affecting sequences, which is more observational than experimental. Option F is about identical sequences in unrelated proteins, which supports a genetic cause but not necessarily direct evidence. Option G is wrong. Option H is about the synthesis without genetic material, which ties into the ribosome experiment. Option I is about ribosome malfunction producing same sequences elsewhere, which again points to gene control. So among the options, E and I both relate to gene effects, but E is more about mutation-induced issues, while I is about replication in different proteins. Between those, I think E is better because it shows that altering the gene affects the protein, demonstrating its control.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, option J says \"The uniformity of amino acid sequences in proteins across all living organisms suggests genetic control.\" But that's more about biological regularities rather than the evidence directly linking genes to amino acid sequences. Option B mentions direct observation of genes attaching amino acids to proteins in live cells, which sounds like actual experiments where you see how genes attach amino acids. But I'm not sure if that's considered evidence or just a method. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated species, which relates to evolution rather than causation. Option G is about environmental factors, which I don't think is the main evidence here. Option H is about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which might be part of a study but not the primary evidence. Option C is opposite, saying genes don't control amino acids, which is incorrect. Option D is about studies removing genes affecting sequences, but again, not the same as evidence. Option A says the amino acid sequence isn't related to genetics, which contradicts what we're looking for. Option I is about ribosome malfunction producing same sequences elsewhere, which aligns with the idea that missing a gene causes issues. So I think option I is the best fit.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, maybe option B or D relate more to observations during experiments. Option B talks about directly observing genes attaching amino acids in live cells, but that might be part of a later study after the initial experiments. Option D mentions studies where removing genes doesn't affect amino acid sequences, which could indicate that genes do influence them indirectly. But the question specifically asks for evidence that genes control these sequences directly. So perhaps the best fit is option B, as it describes an experiment where genes attach amino acids, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, I recall that in early experiments, scientists observed that when a gene wasn't present, the ribosome couldn't function correctly, leading to incorrect amino acid sequences. This would support the idea that genes directly control these sequences. Hmm, but none of the options exactly say that. The closest might be option E, but it's about mutation causing issues. Maybe I should go with option B since it's about the attachment of amino acids, which ties into how genes influence protein structure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Hmm, perhaps another option would be better. Option G mentions amino acid sequences being determined by environmental factors. No, that contradicts the idea that genes control them. Option H talks about synthetic amino acids without genetic material. That's probably unrelated. Option B and C seem too vague or incorrect. Option D about studies removing genes affecting amino acids\u2014maybe, but again, not directly linking genes to the sequences. Option F is about identical sequences in unrelated species, which doesn't involve genes. Option J states that uniformity across all species suggests genetic control. That makes sense because if genes controlled amino acids, proteins from different species should look similar. But wait, isn't that more of a general observation rather than experimental evidence? Option I is about ribosome malfunction causing same amino acids elsewhere. That seems like it ties genes directly into the formation of proteins. So I'm leaning towards option I as the correct answer since it directly links gene function to amino acid sequences.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, which states \"Amino acid sequences in proteins are determined by environmental factors.\" No, that doesn't make sense because it contradicts the known biological processes. H is about synthesis without genetic material, which might relate to how genes function but isn't directly about amino acids. F mentions identical sequences from unrelated species, which points more towards homology rather than genetic control. D talks about removing genes affecting amino acid sequences, which would show that genes do influence them. But the question asks for evidence indicating control, not just removal. Option J says \"The uniformity of amino acid sequences...\" which again relates more to biology than genetics. Option C is opposite; genes don't control amino acids. So maybe the correct answer is B or E. Wait, B is about observing genes attach amino acids to chains in live cells. That sounds like it's describing an experiment where you see genes physically binding amino acids during protein folding. That would provide direct evidence of gene-to-amino acid mapping. Option E seems to be about mutations causing issues, which ties into the importance of genes. However, I'm a bit confused because I think the primary evidence came from experiments involving ribosomes, as in E. But since the user asked for a single letter, I'll go with the most straightforward answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Option F mentions identical sequences from unrelated species, which points towards genetic basis, but again, not exactly the same as the question. Option J states that uniformity across all life suggests genetic control. That sounds plausible. Option H discusses synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which might relate to the process itself, but not necessarily proving gene control yet. Option I talks about ribosome malfunction causing matching sequences, which ties back to the point where mutations in genes affected the outcome. So putting it together, E and J seem close, but E specifically refers to mutation effects, while J is about uniformity implying control. Since the question asks for experimental evidence, E might not be the best fit because it's more about empirical results than just stating the effect. Therefore, J is the better choice. It states that uniformity suggests genetic control, aligning with the premise.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, another experiment involving RNA interference might be relevant, but none of the options mention that except perhaps H. Option H states that aminoacids are determined by environmental factors, which contradicts the idea that genes control them. So that's probably incorrect. Option G claims that aminoacids are determined by environment, which would mean genes don't play a role, so that's opposite. Option B talks about observing genes attaching amino acids to proteins in live cells. I'm not sure about that; maybe it's about transcription or translation initiation but not directly about gene control over amino acid sequences. Option D mentions removing certain genes not affecting amino acid sequences, which could indicate that genes do influence them, but again, it's not conclusive on whether it's controlled by them. Option C says genes have no control, which goes against the question. Option F is about identical sequences in unrelated species, which relates to evolutionary relationships and common ancestry but doesn't address gene control. Option J suggests uniformity implies genetic control, which aligns with what we're looking for. However, J is a bit vague. Option I deals with ribosome malfunction causing same amino acid issues, which supports the idea that genes affect amino acid sequences through protein synthesis. But I'm not sure if that's considered experimental evidence supporting the claim. Option A says the sequence isn't related to genetics, which seems to oppose the idea entirely. Option E is about mutation effects, which while important, might not be as strong empirical evidence as others. Option D focuses on the effect of removing genes, which tests causality but doesn't show direct evidence. So putting it together, the most likely correct answer is J because it points towards the uniformity suggesting genetic control, even though I'm uncertain if I've seen such strong evidence before.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, another approach was using enzymes like chaperones or ribosomal proteins to see how they function without relying on the ribosome. Option B talks about directly observing genes attaching amino acids in live cells. But I'm not sure about that; maybe it's about live cell imaging techniques rather than the actual proof. Another angle is the experiment where scientists observed that when a gene isn't expressed, the protein doesn't form correctly, indicating that the gene is responsible. This would tie into option I, but I'm not sure if that's an option here. Wait, looking again, option I says \"Ribosome malfunction has been shown to produce identical amino acid sequences in different proteins.\" Hmm, that sounds similar to what I recalled earlier. If a gene isn't functioning, the ribosome can't read the mRNA correctly, leading to mismatches in amino acids. So the presence of a functional gene leads to proper protein formation, while its absence causes issues. This would support the idea that genes control amino acids. So option I might be the right choice, but I'm also thinking about option F, which mentions identical amino acid sequences in unrelated proteins. That could imply a universal mechanism, but I don't think that's the primary evidence. Option G suggests environmental factors control sequences, which contradicts the question. Option C is opposite of what we want. Option D is about removing genes affecting amino acids, which doesn't fit. Option A is just stating a fact, not evidence. Option B is about observing genes attach amino acids in live cells, which might involve live cell imaging but perhaps not the direct evidence of gene control. Option E is about mutation causing errors, which relates to gene expression changes but might not be the initial evidence. So putting it together, the most likely correct answer is either I or B. But I'm leaning towards I because it directly ties gene function to protein structure.

Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, option B mentions directly observing genes attaching amino acids to proteins in live cells, which sounds like biochemical evidence, possibly through imaging or bioluminescence. Option G talks about environmental factors determining amino acids, which seems less likely as it would be more about evolution. Option C seems opposite, stating genes don't control amino acids, which contradicts the question. Option D says studies show removing genes won't affect amino acids, which is true but doesn't explain why they matter. Option F is about identical sequences from unrelated species, which relates to common descent theory, supporting the idea of shared ancestry but not causation. Option H talks about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which might refer to how ribosomes work in vitro, but again, maybe not the same as cause-effect evidence. Option J states that uniformity across all organisms suggests genetic control, which aligns with the idea that genes determine amino acid patterns. But wait, the key evidence comes from lab experiments where mutations in genes caused mismatches, showing direct control. So maybe the best fit is option E, referencing Ingram's finding, even though it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, option J points to a broader conclusion about genetic control, which could also be correct. Since the question asks specifically for evidence that genes control amino acid sequences, both E and J seem plausible, but I'm more confident that E refers to the specific lab experiment about ribosome function.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Alternatively, another point is the experiment where removing a gene caused a misfolded protein, indicating that the gene's product affects the outcome. That would support option I, but let me check again. Option H mentions synthesis without genetic material. That sounds like RNA interference or something else, maybe not directly related. Option D talks about studies on gene removal affecting amino acid sequences. That also fits because if you remove a gene, the protein structure changes. But how does that show the genes themselves control the amino acids? It might imply that without the gene, the effect occurs, but perhaps not directly proving the gene controls them. Option G says aminoacids are determined by environment, which contradicts the idea that genes control them. Option F is about identical sequences in unrelated species, which could suggest a common origin but doesn't prove direct gene control. Option B is about observing genes attach amino acids to protein chains in live cells. That's more of a biochemical assay, showing physical association but not necessarily causation linking genes to amino acid sequences. Option C is about genes having no control, which is opposite of what we're looking for. Option A says the sequence isn't related to genetics\u2014so it's incorrect since the question is about evidence supporting the claim. Option J states uniformity across all living organisms suggests genetic control. That makes sense because if genes controlled amino acids, similar proteins from different species should have similar sequences. So option J is likely the right choice. Another angle is the ribosomal mutagenesis experiment, which showed that the absence of a gene leads to a nonfunctional ribosome, causing a mismatched protein. This directly links the gene to the amino acid sequence. However, none of the options mention ribosomes specifically. So perhaps the closest is option J, as it's stating that uniformity implies genetic control.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",
