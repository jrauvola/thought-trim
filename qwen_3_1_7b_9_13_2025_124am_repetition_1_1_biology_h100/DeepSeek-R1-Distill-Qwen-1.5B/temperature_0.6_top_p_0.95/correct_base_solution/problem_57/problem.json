  "problem": "What experimental evidence indicates that genes control the aminoacid sequences in proteins?\n\nA. The amino acid sequence in a protein is not related to genetics.\n\nB. Direct observation of genes attaching amino acids to growing protein chains in live cells.\n\nC. Genes have no control over aminoacid sequences in proteins.\n\nD. Studies have shown that the removal of certain genes does not affect the amino acid sequence in proteins.\n\nE. Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\n\nF. The presence of identical amino acid sequences in proteins from unrelated species.\n\nG. Aminoacid sequences in proteins are determined by environmental factors.\n\nH. The synthesis of amino acids in laboratory conditions without any genetic material involved.\n\nI. Ribosome malfunction has been shown to produce identical amino acid sequences in different proteins.\n\nJ. The uniformity of amino acid sequences in proteins across all living organisms suggests genetic control.",
