  "problem": "What is differential reproduction? What factors bring about differential reproduction?\n\nA. Differential reproduction is the result of equal survival rates for all genotypes within a population\n\nB. Differential reproduction is driven exclusively by the presence of predators in an ecosystem\n\nC. Differential reproduction occurs when certain traits prevent any mating from happening\n\nD. Differential reproduction is when genetic mutations are the only factor influencing which offspring survive\n\nE. Differential reproduction is purely based on random mating\n\nF. Differential reproduction is determined solely by the environmental temperature during breeding seasons\n\nG. Differential reproduction is related to the physical strength of the species\n\nH. Differential reproduction is when all offsprings have the same genotype\n\nI. Differential reproduction occurs when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating. It results from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility.\n\nJ. Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes",
