First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. Option C mentions two leaflets and nuclear pores, which aligns with what I know. Option G describes its role as a barrier, which is correct but doesn't mention the pores. Since the question includes both aspects, maybe both could be correct. However, looking again, the options are separate. Maybe only one is intended. Given that, I'll go with C as the primary description.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function.",

Wait, the user provided a list where C and G are separate options. Since I can only choose one letter, I should see which one fits better. Option C is about two leaflets and nuclear pores, which are important features of the nuclear membrane. Option G is about being a barrier, which is another function.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. So G is correct because the nuclear membrane is a rigid, impermeable barrier. C is also correct because it includes the nuclear pores. But the question is asking which best describes the structure and function, so both could be right. However, looking again, the options are separate, so maybe the question expects only one correct answer. Since I have to pick one, I'll go with G because it directly addresses the barrier aspect.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. Option G accurately describes its role as an impermeable barrier, while C discusses its structural components. Since the question includes 'comprises' in C, it's about the components.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. So both aspects are important.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. The structural features include being double-layered with nuclear pores. So C is correct regarding its composition. Alternatively, if someone considers G as correct, then that's another way.

But since I can only choose one, I'll select the most comprehensive one regarding both structure and function. G mentions the barrier aspect, whereas C discusses the function via pores.

The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which is accurate. Option G says it's a rigid barrier, which is also correct. However, sometimes the term \"barrier\" implies something else, like impermeable, whereas \"rigid\" could mean different things. Between C and G, C seems more precise because it lists the components, whereas G is more general. Since the user wants a single letter, I'll go with C or G. Let me check again: C says two leaflets with nuclear pores for communication. G says it's a rigid, impermeable barrier. Both are correct descriptions, but the question is about the structure and function. Perhaps the best answer is C because it directly addresses the components involved.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. Option G is about its role as a barrier, while C is about its composition. Since the question includes the word \"comprises,\" G is more directly related. Alternatively, if I have to choose between C and G, I think G is more precise because it mentions the function of the nuclear membrane as a barrier. However, sometimes the double membrane is referred to as having two layers, making C correct as well. Maybe the best choice here is G because it clearly states the function as a barrier.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. The function is about communication via nuclear pores, making C the better choice. However, sometimes people confuse the double membrane with the fact that it's impenetrable. Maybe both C and G are correct, but if I have to pick one, C seems to cover both aspects: the structure (two layers) and the function (pores). Whereas G is just the structure aspect. Since the question is about the structure and function, both could be correct, but I think the most comprehensive answer is G, emphasizing the barrier. Alternatively, perhaps C is more precise because it includes both structural features and the functional role. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Let me check another source mentally. Oh right, the nuclear membrane is indeed a double-layered structure with nuclear pores for nuclear-to-cytoplasmic communication. So both parts are correct. But the question is asking for the structure and function, so perhaps G is the structure description, and C is about the function. If I have to choose one, maybe G is more relevant since it focuses on the barrier aspect. Alternatively, if the question expects a broader term, then C is better. Since I can only choose one, I'll go with G, as it directly addresses the barrier function.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. G states it's a rigid, impermeable barrier, which is accurate. C mentions nuclear pores for communication, which is also correct. But does G cover the entire structure or just the function? Since the question includes both structure and function, both could be correct. However, looking back, the user provided options where only one is correct. Wait, actually, I think the question expects one correct answer. Let me check again. Option C says two leaflets with nuclear pores. That's accurate. Option G says it's a rigid, impermeable barrier. That's also accurate. Maybe both are correct, but the way the options are phrased, perhaps the intended answer is C. Alternatively, considering the function, perhaps G is more encompassing. I'm a bit confused here. In my initial analysis, I thought C was correct, but upon second thoughts, G also fits. Maybe I should consider that the nuclear membrane has two layers (C) and specific pore structures (G). Since the question combines structure and function, both are important. But if I must choose one, perhaps G is more directly related to the barrier aspect. Alternatively, I might have mixed up C and G. Wait, the user said only one letter, so perhaps the correct answer is either C or G. Given that, I'll settle on C as the primary answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
