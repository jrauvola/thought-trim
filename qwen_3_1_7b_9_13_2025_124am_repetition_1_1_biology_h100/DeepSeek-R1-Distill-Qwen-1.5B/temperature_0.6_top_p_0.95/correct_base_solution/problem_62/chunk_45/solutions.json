Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins.

From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food.

Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying.

From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. Could be convergent. Now, looking back at the options, H explicitly shows wings of insects and birds. This is a well-known example of convergent evolution because both insects and birds evolved similar wing structures to fly. This definitely fits.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Convergent evolution often involves similar traits arising in different species because they face similar ecological challenges. For instance, the wings of insects and birds evolved similarly because both needed to fly. That's a solid example. Another example could be the fur of bears and scales of fish, as both need to stay warm and blend into their environments. Or maybe the beaks of birds and teeth of mammals, but those don't share similar structures. Alternatively, the wings of insects and birds definitely fit well.\n\nWait, the initial thought was H, but I might have confused with I. Let me check the list again. Option H: wings of an insect and the wings of a bird. Yes, that's a classic convergent example because both evolved the same wing shape to fly. Similarly, option I: fur of a bear and scales of a fish, both need to regulate body temperature and blend into their surroundings, leading to similar adaptations.

That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. This could fit the definition.\n\nSo, looking back, options H and I both seem like good candidates. But wait, the question asks for one answer. Let me think again. Convergent evolution often involves similar traits arising in different species because they face similar ecological challenges. For instance, the wings of insects and birds evolved similarly because both needed to fly. That's a solid example. Another example could be the fur of bears and scales of fish, as both need to stay warm and blend into their environments. Or maybe the beaks of birds and teeth of mammals, but those don't share similar structures. Alternatively, the wings of insects and birds definitely fit well.\n\nWait, the initial thought was H, but I might have confused with I. Let me check the list again. Option H: wings of an insect and the wings of a bird. Yes, that's a classic convergent example because both evolved the same wing shape to fly. Similarly, option I: fur of a bear and scales of a fish, both need to regulate body temperature and blend into their surroundings, leading to similar adaptations. But the question is asking for the best exemplification, and both H and I are correct. However, perhaps the most widely recognized example is the wings of insects and birds, making H the better choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement.

From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. Could this be an example? Now, looking back, the question asks for the best exemplification of convergent evolution. Among the options, H and I seem like good candidates because they involve similar structures evolving for different functions. However, the most famous example is definitely the wings of insects and birds, which is option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. This might fit convergent evolution as well.\n\nSo looking back, options H and I seem like good candidates for convergent evolution. But wait, the question asks for \"which\" pair, implying one correct answer. Let me think again. Convergent evolution often involves similar traits arising in unrelated species. For example, the wings of insects and birds. Another example could be the similar flippers in starfish and jellyfish. Or the wings of bats and insects. However, the most famous example is the wings of insects and birds. So I think option H is the best answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which pair of examples best demonstrates convergent evolution. From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. This might fit as convergent evolution. Now, looking back at the options, H clearly shows a direct relationship between similar wing structures in insects and birds, which is a well-known example of convergent evolution. The others either don't have a direct convergent link or involve different types of adaptations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures.

From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. This fits convergent evolution.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, H and J are both showing similarities in physical structures leading to similar functions. But wait, the question asks for the best exemplification. Convergent evolution typically involves two species evolving the same trait independently. Out of these, H and J involve similar structures leading to similar functions, which fits the definition.\n\nBetween H and J, H is about insects and birds, which are quite different in evolutionary history. J is about elephants and giraffes, which are both large animals but have different body parts. Comparatively, H shows a direct match between insect wings and bird wings, which is a well-known example of convergent evolution. Similarly, J shows a direct match between elephant trunk and giraffe neck, which are structurally similar but serve different roles. However, H is a more straightforward and widely recognized example of convergent evolution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which pair of examples best demonstrates convergent evolution. From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement.

From what I remember, convergent evolution happens when different species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. So, it's like two different animals or organisms ending up with something very similar because they're adapting to the same kind of environment. Looking at the options: A. Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land.

Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying.

Gills for fish and lungs for humans. Gills are adapted for water, while lungs are for breathing air. Different adaptations probably, but maybe not as much in comparison. B. Leaves of an oak vs. spines of a cactus. Oak trees have leaves that look green, while cacti have spines. That seems more like different functions rather than similar adaptations from similar environments. Maybe not convergent. C. Eyes of a human and eyes of a squid. Squids have clear eyes, while humans have eyes too, though slightly different designs. This might show some similarity in function, but it's more about having eyes rather than being completely analogous. D. Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Tree roots can support weight, and animal legs provide balance. These are both structural adaptations, but different roles\u2014tree roots supporting soil, animal legs providing movement. Maybe related but not necessarily convergent. E. Notochord in chordates. The notochord is a structure found in many marine mammals, including whales and dolphins. It's crucial for their swimmer's ability. Is there another chordate without a notochord? Like, do any other chordates have structures similar to a notochord? I think notochords are unique to certain marine mammals. So maybe no convergent here. F. Beak of a bird and teeth of a mammal. Birds use beaks for eating, while mammals use teeth for chewing food. They serve entirely different purposes and likely evolved independently. That sounds like convergent evolution since both need similar structures but in entirely different contexts. G. Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Fish have fins for maneuvering through water, while cats' legs allow them to move quickly on land. Both are structural features, but again, different purposes. Could this be an example of convergent evolution? H. Wings of an insect and wings of a bird. Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying. This is a classic case of convergent evolution where similar wing shapes evolved independently in different species to achieve similar functions (flight). This seems like a strong candidate. I. Fur of a bear and scales of a fish. Bears have fur for insulation and hunting, while fish have scales for camouflage and protection. Different functions but similar physical structures. This could be a case of convergent evolution. J. Trunk of an elephant and neck of a giraffe. Elephants have long trunks for mobility, while giraffes have thick necks for strength and movement. Similar physical structures but serving different roles. Maybe convergent if the structures were adapted for the same environment.\n\nSo, looking back, option H specifically talks about wings, which is a well-known example of convergent evolution. Insect wings and bird wings evolving similarly to enable flight.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Insects have wings for flight, birds also have wings for flying.
