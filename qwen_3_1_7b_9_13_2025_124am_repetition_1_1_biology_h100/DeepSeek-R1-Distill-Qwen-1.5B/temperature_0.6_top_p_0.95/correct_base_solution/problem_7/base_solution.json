  "solution": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time.\n\nNext, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. Over time, as these molecules decompose or change, you can see where they came from by detecting the original label. This technique helps in mapping metabolic pathways because it allows researchers to see how different molecules interact and move through the cell.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Labels substance with radioisotopes for studying metabolic paths, applicable elsewhere.\n\nThis seems directly related to what I was thinking. Using radioisotopes helps track metabolic pathways, making option A correct.\n\nB. Radioactive isotopes improve food taste and texture.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. These aren't tools for food enhancement.\n\nC. Stimulate the immune system.\n\nNot related at all. Immunity is more about fighting off diseases rather than using isotopes.\n\nD. Increase oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.\n\nAgain, unrelated. Oxygen transport isn't about labeling isotopes.\n\nE. Enhance agricultural crops' growth.\n\nNo connection there either. Growth techniques are different from labeling isotopes.\n\nF. As a direct nutrient supplement.\n\nNot really. Nutrient supplements are about providing energy or vitamins, not using isotopes.\n\nG. Create glow-in-the-dark materials.\n\nNope. Glow materials usually involve chemicals like carbon disulfides or nitrosamines, not isotopes.\n\nH. Provide energy for spacecrafts.\n\nSpacecraft require fuel, but isotopes aren't involved in that process.\n\nI. Kill cancer cells.\n\nThat's a medical application, not biological research in general.\n\nJ. Date archaeological samples.\n\nDating methods like radiocarbon are used in archaeology, but labeling isotopes themselves aren't involved in dating.\n\nSo, reviewing, option A stands out because it directly relates to tracking metabolic pathways through labeled isotopes, which fits the biological research context described.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",
