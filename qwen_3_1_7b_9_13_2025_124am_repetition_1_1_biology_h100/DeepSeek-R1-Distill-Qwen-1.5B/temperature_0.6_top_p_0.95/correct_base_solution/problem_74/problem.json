  "problem": "What are some advantages of doing genetics in bacteria and yeastinstead of in larger organisms (i.e.,multicellular eukaryotes)?\n\nA. Bacteria and yeast are more complex organisms.\n\nB. Bacteria and yeast have longer life cycles, allowing for extended study over time.\n\nC. Bacteria and yeast can perform more complex behaviors than multicellular organisms, which makes them better for study.\n\nD. Bacteria and yeast have larger genomes, providing more genetic material to work with.\n\nE. Bacteria and yeast are less susceptible to genetic diseases, making them more stable for experimentation.\n\nF. Bacteria and yeast have a slower rate of mutation.\n\nG. Bacteria and yeast do not require ethical considerations when used in experiments.\n\nH. Bacteria and yeast grow quickly, inexpensively, in a small space and have a high probability of mutation. Prokaryotes are haploid, making single inactivation more likely. Yeast are eukaryotic, closely related to multicellular animals and plants, and can be grown in either the haploid or diploid state.\n\nI. Bacteria and yeast have a lower rate of genetic recombination, making genetic mapping simpler.\n\nJ. Bacteria and yeast are easier to maintain in a lab.",
