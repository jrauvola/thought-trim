  "solution": "\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, let's break down what each option means:\n\n- **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire.\n  \n- **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization.\n  \n- **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative).\n  \n- **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens.\n  \n- **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing.\n  \n- **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage?\n  \n- **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero.\n  \n- **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons?\n  \n- **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal.\n  \n- **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event.\n\nNow, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative.\n\nLet's go through each option:\n\nA. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A.\n\nB. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely.\n\nC. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right.\n\nD. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV.\n\nE. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself.\n\nF. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know.\n\nG. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative.\n\nH. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply.\n\nI. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described.\n\nJ. Repolarization: Correct. Because it's decreasing from a hyperpolarized state.\n\nK. Synapse potential: Again, not sure, might not be relevant.\n\nL. Another terms: I think J is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be J. Repolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",
