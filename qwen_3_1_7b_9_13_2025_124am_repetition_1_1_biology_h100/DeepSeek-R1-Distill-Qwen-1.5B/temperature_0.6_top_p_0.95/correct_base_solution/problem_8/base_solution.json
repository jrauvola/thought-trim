  "solution": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand what uniformitarianism means in terms of geological changes. I remember hearing about different theories like uniformitarianism and ge Occidentism, but I need to break it down. \n\nUniformitarianism sounds to me like it says that all things should be seen as happening naturally, without supernatural explanations. So if there's a geological change, it's probably because of something natural rather than a miracle or an event outside our control. That would mean the earth isn't really changing; it's just evolving on its own. \n\nLooking at the options now:\n\nA. Says human activity drives geological changes, which doesn't sound right because uniformitarianism is more about natural processes.\n\nB. Claims the earth is static, which contradicts uniformitarianism since it's about change being natural.\n\nC. Speedy changes\u2014again, uniformitarianism focuses on gradual, natural processes, not rapid ones.\n\nD. Suggests same processes didn't happen before, implying continuity. Wait, no, uniformitarianism is about natural processes, not saying they didn't exist before. It just means we can't explain changes away.\n\nE. Talks about processes exclusive during events\u2014it doesn't fit either; uniformity emphasizes natural causes.\n\nF. Asserts the earth was created in one divine plan\u2014this seems like ge Occidentism, which might be related but not exactly uniformitarianism.\n\nG. Suggests life evolves organically and the earth is old\u2014this aligns well with uniformitarianism's idea of natural processes leading to geological changes over time.\n\nH. Assures geological changes aren't predictable\u2014no, uniformitarianism doesn't say anything about predictability; it's more about naturalness.\n\nI. States geological forces have changed over time\u2014yes, again, uniformitarianism supports natural, gradual processes.\n\nJ. Says Earth is only a few thousand years old\u2014this doesn't align with uniformitarianism, which often suggests a much older age, though some theories still debate this.\n\nSo putting it together, G and I both seem relevant. But looking back, uniformitarianism specifically implies that geological processes are natural and continuous, so G makes sense as it talks about the formation of features through organic processes. I, while also correct, talks about change happening over time.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
