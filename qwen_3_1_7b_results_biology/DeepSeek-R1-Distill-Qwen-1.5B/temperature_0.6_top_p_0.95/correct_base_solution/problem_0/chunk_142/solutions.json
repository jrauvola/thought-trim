    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.",
    "rollout": " Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. The probability of both being absent is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So now, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Both C and B absent \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, let's see what the user is asking. They want the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. From our calculation, it's 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2.

Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nLooking again, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not accounting for dominance properly.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not accounting for dominance properly. Wait no\u2014actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So the calculation is different. Let me approach it differently. The probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. Therefore, the probability that a bird has both traits is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other gene. So the actual calculation should consider all combinations where at least one dominant allele is present for each trait. So the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes. Total possible phenotypes: 4 (as above). Favorable outcomes: 3 (phenotypes A, B, C) plus 1 for phenotype D? Wait, no\u2014phenotype D is when neither C nor B is present, which is 1 outcome. So total favorable for A, B, C: 3. Total possible: 4. So the probability is 3/4. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each bird's phenotype depends on both traits, not just one. Hmm, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their C and B alleles. The possible genotypic combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A occurs in cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype B occurs in cases 2, 5, 8 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype D occurs in cases 3, 6, 9 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown) does not occur because none of the birds have the bb genotype.\n\nTherefore, all three non-D phenotypes (A, B, D) occur equally often, each appearing 3 times out of 9 possible bird types. Wait, but that can't be right because each bird is diploid and has two traits. Alternatively, considering each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait, the frequency of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: both C and B dominant \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\nPhenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\nPhenotype D: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\nPhenotype C: both recessive \u2192 0\n\nWait, but according to our earlier count, all three non-D phenotypes (A, B, D) occur equally often, each appearing 3 times out of 9. So the phenotypic distribution would be 3/9 for each of A, B, D, totaling 9/9. But looking back, the initial count shows that each non-D phenotype occurs 3 times, so their probabilities are 3/9 each, which simplifies to 1/3. But then, why does the user provide options that seem to suggest a different distribution?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by the presence of C (dominant) vs. c (recessive). Body color is determined by B (dominant) vs. b (recessive). So the phenotype is determined by whether each trait is present. So for a bird to have both traits, it needs at least one dominant allele for each. For example, a bird with CB will have both traits, whereas a bird with cb will have none for B. Similarly, a bird with cB will have none for C. Only a bird with CC and BB will have both traits.\n\nSo, going back to the count:\n\nTotal possible bird genotypes after F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo Phenotype A occurs in cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\nPhenotype B occurs in cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances (wait, no\u2014cases 2 and 5)\nWait, no\u2014case 2 is Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\nCase 5 is Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\nSo Phenotype B occurs twice.\nSimilarly, Phenotype D occurs in cases 3, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 4 instances\nAnd Phenotype C (plain and brown) never occurs.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3/9 = 1/3\n- Phenotype B: 2/9 \u2248 2/9\n- Phenotype D: 4/9\n- Phenotype C: 0\n\nBut looking at the options provided by the user, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red (which is plain red) \u2192 12\n- Checkered brown (plain brown) \u2192 2\n- Plain red (checkered) \u2192 2\n- Plain brown (checkered) \u2192 0\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:4:0, which doesn't match any of the options directly. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait results in the respective phenotype. So for a bird to have both traits, it must have at least one dominant allele for both C and B. The other possibilities are:\n\n- Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Only C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, the count of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B recessive): Cases 3, 6, 9 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D (both recessive): Cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype C (none): 0 instances\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype B occurs twice and Phenotype D occurs three times, while Phenotype A occurs three times. So the ratio would be Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype D = 3 : 2 : 3, which simplifies to 3:2:3, but the sum is 8, leaving out Phenotype C. This doesn't align with the given options either. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene allows the other trait to be expressed. For example, if a bird is heterozygous for one gene, it can still express the dominant allele in the other gene. So, for example, a bird with CB will have both traits because it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. Similarly, a bird with Cb will also have both traits because it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has CB, it has at least one dominant allele in both genes. So actually, all birds except those with cc in both genes (phenotype D) have at least one dominant allele in at least one gene. Therefore, the only phenotype without both traits is phenotype D. So the phenotypic distribution should be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): All birds except those with cc in both genes \u2192 9 - 3 = 6 birds\n- Phenotype B (only C dominant, B recessive): 2 birds\n- Phenotype D (only B dominant, C recessive): 3 birds\n\nWait, but according to the Punnett square, there are 9 birds in total. So Phenotype A: 6, Phenotype B: 2, Phenotype D: 1 (but this contradicts previous counts). Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Phenotype C\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo now, among the 9 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo,\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype C: None\n- Phenotype D: Cases 3, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 4 instances\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:4:0, which simplifies to 3:2:4:0. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Phenotypes checked red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Which corresponds to Phenotype C, B, A, D respectively. According to my count, Phenotype A is 3, B is 2, D is 4, C is 0. So Option G matches Phenotype C: 12, B:2, A:2, D:0. But according to my count, A is 3, D is 4. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me read the user's description again. They say:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nThe user provides several options, including:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping of the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The user defines:\n\n- Red color is controlled by C \u2192 C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n- Brown color is controlled by B \u2192 B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- If C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- If C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- If both absent \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nIn my earlier analysis, Phenotype A was 3, B was 2, D was 4. But the options don't match this. Let me check what the user's options are.\n\nLooking back, the user lists the options as:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nK. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, the phenotypic distribution is 3:2:4:0, which sums to 9. Looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. However, option K states a ratio of 4:4:4:0, which sums to 12, but that's inconsistent with our 9 bird population. Option J has 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. Option E has 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16. H:5+3+2+6=16. I:7+5+1+3=16. F:4+4+4+4=16. M: I think I miscounted before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me recount the phenotypes based on the actual possible combinations. Each bird's genotype leads to a specific phenotype. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- Gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- Gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach combination leads to a phenotype based on dominance. The total number of phenotypes is 4: A (CC BB), B (CC Bb), C (CC bb), D (Cc BB), E (Cc Bb), F (Cc bb), G (cc BB), H (cc Bb), I (cc bb). Wait, but each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should consider the combination of both traits.\n\nLet me create a grid:\n\n|           | Gene B (B or b) | Gene C (C or c) |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Gene B    | B                | b                |\n| Gene C    | C                | c                |\n\nNow, fill in the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- If both B and C are present (B and C), Phenotype A.\n- If B present, C absent \u2192 Phenotype B.\n- If B absent, C present \u2192 Phenotype C.\n- If both absent \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nNow, let's map each combination to the phenotype:\n\n1. BB (B) and CC (C) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. BB (B) and Cc (c) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. BB (B) and cc (c) \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. Bb (B) and CC (C) \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Bb (B) and Cc (c) \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. Bb (B) and cc (c) \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. bb (B) and CC (C) \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. bb (B) and Cc (c) \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. bb (B) and cc (c) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nCounting:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 5 instances\n- Phenotype C: None\n\nWait, that adds up to 2 + 2 + 5 + 0 = 9, which is correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 2\n- Phenotype B: 2\n- Phenotype D: 5\n- Phenotype C: 0\n\nBut the options do not include this exact distribution. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 checkered red (A?), checkered brown (B?), plain red (C?), plain brown (D?) Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the user's definition of the phenotypes. Let me re-express:\n\nIf a bird has C (C) and B (B) \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\nIf a bird has C (C) and B (b) \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\nIf a bird has C (c) and B (B) \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\nIf a bird has C (c) and B (b) \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nSo, in the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 D\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 B\n6.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not accounting for dominance properly. Wait no\u2014actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So the calculation is different. Let me approach it differently. The probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. Therefore, the probability that a bird has both traits is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other gene. So the actual calculation should consider all combinations where at least one dominant allele is present for each trait. So the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes. Total possible phenotypes: 4 (as above). Favorable outcomes: 3 (phenotypes A, B, C) plus 1 for phenotype D? Wait, no\u2014phenotype D is when neither C nor B is present, which is 1 outcome. So total favorable for A, B, C: 3. Total possible: 4. So the probability is 3/4. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each bird's phenotype depends on both traits, not just one. Hmm, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their C and B alleles. The possible genotypic combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A occurs in cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype B occurs in cases 2, 5, 8 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype D occurs in cases 3, 6, 9 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown) does not occur because none of the birds have the bb genotype.\n\nTherefore, all three non-D phenotypes (A, B, D) occur equally often, each appearing 3 times out of 9 possible bird types. Wait, but that can't be right because each bird is diploid and has two traits. Alternatively, considering each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait, the frequency of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: both C and B dominant \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\nPhenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\nPhenotype D: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\nPhenotype C: both recessive \u2192 0\n\nWait, but according to our earlier count, all three non-D phenotypes (A, B, D) occur equally often, each appearing 3 times out of 9. So the phenotypic distribution would be 3/9 for each of A, B, D, totaling 9/9. But looking back, the initial count shows that each non-D phenotype occurs 3 times, so their probabilities are 3/9 each, which simplifies to 1/3. But then, why does the user provide options that seem to suggest a different distribution?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by the presence of C (dominant) vs. c (recessive). Body color is determined by B (dominant) vs. b (recessive). So the phenotype is determined by whether each trait is present. So for a bird to have both traits, it needs at least one dominant allele for each. For example, a bird with CB will have both traits, whereas a bird with cb will have none for B. Similarly, a bird with cB will have none for C. Only a bird with CC and BB will have both traits.\n\nSo, going back to the count:\n\nTotal possible bird genotypes after F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo Phenotype A occurs in cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\nPhenotype B occurs in cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances (wait, no\u2014cases 2 and 5)\nWait, no\u2014case 2 is Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\nCase 5 is Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\nSo Phenotype B occurs twice.\nSimilarly, Phenotype D occurs in cases 3, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 4 instances\nAnd Phenotype C (plain and brown) never occurs.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3/9 = 1/3\n- Phenotype B: 2/9 \u2248 2/9\n- Phenotype D: 4/9\n- Phenotype C: 0\n\nBut looking at the options provided by the user, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red (which is plain red) \u2192 12\n- Checkered brown (plain brown) \u2192 2\n- Plain red (checkered) \u2192 2\n- Plain brown (checkered) \u2192 0\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:4:0, which doesn't match any of the options directly. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait results in the respective phenotype. So for a bird to have both traits, it must have at least one dominant allele for both C and B. The other possibilities are:\n\n- Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Only C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, the count of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B recessive): Cases 3, 6, 9 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D (both recessive): Cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype C (none): 0 instances\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype B occurs twice and Phenotype D occurs three times, while Phenotype A occurs three times. So the ratio would be Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype D = 3 : 2 : 3, which simplifies to 3:2:3, but the sum is 8, leaving out Phenotype C. This doesn't align with the given options either. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene allows the other trait to be expressed. For example, if a bird is heterozygous for one gene, it can still express the dominant allele in the other gene. So, for example, a bird with CB will have both traits because it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. Similarly, a bird with Cb will also have both traits because it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has CB, it has at least one dominant allele in both genes. So actually, all birds except those with cc in both genes (phenotype D) have at least one dominant allele in at least one gene. Therefore, the only phenotype without both traits is phenotype D. So the phenotypic distribution should be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): All birds except those with cc in both genes \u2192 9 - 3 = 6 birds\n- Phenotype B (only C dominant, B recessive): 2 birds\n- Phenotype D (only B dominant, C recessive): 3 birds\n\nWait, but according to the Punnett square, there are 9 birds in total. So Phenotype A: 6, Phenotype B: 2, Phenotype D: 1 (but this contradicts previous counts). Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Phenotype C\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo now, among the 9 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo,\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype C: None\n- Phenotype D: Cases 3, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 4 instances\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:4:0, which simplifies to 3:2:4:0. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Phenotypes checked red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Which corresponds to Phenotype C, B, A, D respectively. According to my count, Phenotype A is 3, B is 2, D is 4, C is 0. So Option G matches Phenotype C: 12, B:2, A:2, D:0. But according to my count, A is 3, D is 4. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me read the user's description again. They say:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nThe user provides several options, including:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping of the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The user defines:\n\n- Red color is controlled by C \u2192 C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n- Brown color is controlled by B \u2192 B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- If C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- If C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- If both absent \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nIn my earlier analysis, Phenotype A was 3, B was 2, D was 4. But the options don't match this. Let me check what the user's options are.\n\nLooking back, the user lists the options as:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nK. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, the phenotypic distribution is 3:2:4:0, which sums to 9. Looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. However, option K states a ratio of 4:4:4:0, which sums to 12, but that's inconsistent with our 9 bird population. Option J has 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. Option E has 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16. H:5+3+2+6=16. I:7+5+1+3=16. F:4+4+4+4=16. M: I think I miscounted before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me recount the phenotypes based on the actual possible combinations. Each bird's genotype leads to a specific phenotype. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- Gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- Gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach combination leads to a phenotype based on dominance. The total number of phenotypes is 4: A (CC BB), B (CC Bb), C (CC bb), D (Cc BB), E (Cc Bb), F (Cc bb), G (cc BB), H (cc Bb), I (cc bb). Wait, but each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should consider the combination of both traits.\n\nLet me create a grid:\n\n|           | Gene B (B or b) | Gene C (C or c) |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Gene B    | B                | b                |\n| Gene C    | C                | c                |\n\nNow, fill in the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- If both B and C are present (B and C), Phenotype A.\n- If B present, C absent \u2192 Phenotype B.\n- If B absent, C present \u2192 Phenotype C.\n- If both absent \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nNow, let's map each combination to the phenotype:\n\n1.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but that's not accounting for the fact that having both alleles may lead to different phenotypes depending on dominance.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but that's not accounting for the fact that having both alleles may lead to different phenotypes depending on dominance. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant, regardless of the others. So for a bird to be in Class A (both C and B dominant), it needs at least one dominant allele for C and one dominant allele for B. Which is always true unless both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, then the bird would have neither dominant trait. But in reality, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to exhibit the corresponding trait. So, the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, for a bird to have both traits (red and brown), it must have at least one C and at least one B. The probability of having at least one C is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly for B. But the probability of having both is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. So Class A: 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent. This requires that the bird has at least one C but no B. The probability of having at least one C is 3/4, but without any B. How much is that? Well, for a bird to have at least one C but no B, the possible genotypes are: Cc (since cc would mean no C, which we don't want) and Cc (but wait, no\u2014wait, if a bird has Cc, it still has C, but it also has Bb or Bb, which would make it have B. Wait, no\u2014no, for Class B, the bird must have at least one C but no B. So the possible genotypes are: Cc (with Bb or Bb?) Wait, no\u2014wait, to have at least one C and no B, the bird must have C present and B absent. So the possible genotypes are: Cc (since Cc has C but no B) and cc (which has no C). So the probability is: (1/4) (for Cc) + (1/4) (for cc) = 1/2. Wait, but this approach seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to calculate the probabilities using the Punnett square. Alternatively, since each gene is independent, the combined probability is (prob C present) * (prob B absent) minus the overlap where both are present. Wait, no\u2014actually, the probability of having at least one C and no B is: P(C) > P(B). Hmm, perhaps it's simpler to realize that for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele in C and B leads to the respective trait. So the probability of Class B is the probability that C is present and B is absent. That is: P(C) * P(not B given C). Since the genes are independent, P(not B) is 1/4 (since B is present in 3/4 cases). Wait, no\u2014wait, P(not B) is 1/4 because B is present in 3/4 cases. So P(Class B) = P(C) * P(not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Class C: C absent, B present. This is similar to Class B but with C absent. So P(Class C) = P(not C) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B is present. So both alleles are recessive. Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, adding up all classes:\n\nClass A: 9/16\nClass B: 3/16\nClass C: 3/16\nClass D: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, where A is red and brown, B is red and checkered, C is plain and brown, D is plain and checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nOption G: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nWait, according to our calculation, Class A is checkered red (C and B), Class B is plain red (only C), Class C is plain brown (only B), and Class D is checkered plain (only non-recessive alleles for both). Wait, no\u2014Class D is plain and checkered, which is both non-recessive. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype classification earlier was based on the presence of dominant alleles, but Class D is when neither C nor B is present.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not accounting for the fact that having both alleles may lead to different phenotypes depending on dominance. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant, regardless of the others. So for a bird to be in Class A (both C and B dominant), it needs at least one dominant allele for C and one dominant allele for B. Which is always true unless both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, then the bird would have neither dominant trait. But in reality, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to exhibit the corresponding trait. So, the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, for a bird to have both traits (red and brown), it must have at least one C and at least one B. The probability of having at least one C is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly for B. But the probability of having both is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. So Class A: 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent. This requires that the bird has at least one C but no B. The probability of having at least one C is 3/4, but without any B. How much is that? Well, for a bird to have at least one C but no B, the possible genotypes are: Cc (since cc would mean no C, which we don't want) and Cc (but wait, no\u2014wait, if a bird has Cc, it still has C, but it also has Bb or Bb, which would make it have B. Wait, no\u2014no, for Class B, the bird must have at least one C but no B. So the possible genotypes are: Cc (with Bb or Bb?) Wait, no\u2014wait, to have at least one C and no B, the bird must have C present and B absent. So the possible genotypes are: Cc (since Cc has C but no B) and cc (which has no C). So the probability is: (1/4) (for Cc) + (1/4) (for cc) = 1/2. Wait, but this approach seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to calculate the probabilities using the Punnett square. Alternatively, since each gene is independent, the combined probability is (prob C present) * (prob B absent) minus the overlap where both are present. Wait, no\u2014actually, the probability of having at least one C and no B is: P(C) > P(B). Hmm, perhaps it's simpler to realize that for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele in C and B leads to the respective trait. So the probability of Class B is the probability that C is present and B is absent. That is: P(C) * P(not B given C). Since the genes are independent, P(not B) is 1/4 (since B is present in 3/4 cases). Wait, no\u2014wait, P(not B) is 1/4 because B is present in 3/4 cases. So P(Class B) = P(C) * P(not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Class C: C absent, B present. This is similar to Class B but with C absent. So P(Class C) = P(not C) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B is present. So both alleles are recessive. Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, adding up all classes:\n\nClass A: 9/16\nClass B: 3/16\nClass C: 3/16\nClass D: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, where A is red and brown, B is red and checkered, C is plain and brown, D is plain and checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nOption G: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nWait, according to our calculation, Class A is checkered red (C and B), Class B is plain red (only C), Class C is plain brown (only B), and Class D is checkered plain (only non-recessive alleles for both). Wait, no\u2014Class D is plain and checkered, which is both non-recessive. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype classification earlier was based on the presence of dominant alleles, but Class D is when neither C nor B is present. So in terms of the phenotype, Class D is plain and checkered, which would correspond to the last entry in the list.\n\nWait, looking back, the options provided were:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG. 12,2,2,0\nH. 5,3,2,6\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nFrom our calculations, the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D. So translating to the options: 9 checkered red (assuming A is checkered red), 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 checkered plain. Looking at option G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2014 this matches exactly. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Class C: C absent, B present. C absent is 1/4, B present is 3/4. So probability is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. C absent is 1/4, B absent is 1/4. So probability is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Adding up these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. Now, converting these fractions into ratios:\n\nClass A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\nClass B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass D: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nTo simplify, we can look for common factors. All denominators are 16, so we can write the ratio as 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Which matches our calculation. Option H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Also doesn't match. So the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the correct approach is to look at the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nFor C: \n- Presence (C): 3/4 (since 75% of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor B:\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nThe combined phenotypes are all combinations of these. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown (9/16 chance)\n2. C and b \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered (3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16)\n3. c and B \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown (1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16)\n4. c and b \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered (1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16)\n\nNow, adding up the probabilities:\n\nTotal Phenotype 1: 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.

Similarly, the probability of a bird having only C dominant (and B absent) is (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Same logic applies for the other classes. So:\n\nClass A (both C and B present): (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nClass B (only C present, B absent): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nClass C (only B present, C absent): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nClass D (neither C nor B present): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not exactly right because the presence of C and B is determined by the alleles. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the probability of a bird having both C and B dominant is (prob C is present) * (prob B is present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of a bird having only C dominant (and B absent) is (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Same logic applies for the other classes. So:\n\nClass A (both C and B present): (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nClass B (only C present, B absent): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nClass C (only B present, C absent): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nClass D (neither C nor B present): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nSo option C matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, but let me double-check. Wait, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic classes are indeed four: A, B, C, D. Our calculation shows A is 9/16, B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option C says 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to the ratio as 9 parts red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. So option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, for each phenotype:",
    "rollout": " Similarly, for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present (probability 1/4)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the presence of C requires at least one dominant allele. The chance that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly for B. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present (but B is absent) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype C: Only B present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+1+1+1=12 parts out of 16. Wait, but that sums to 12/16, which leaves 4/16 unaccounted. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to look at each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to list all possible F2 genotypes and then convert them into phenotypes. The F2 genotypes will include combinations of CC, Cc, cc, and BB, Bb, bb. But since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, we need to map each genotype to its phenotype. Let me try constructing a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are: \n\n- CC (25%)\n\n- Cc (50%)\n\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor each of these, combined with the B alleles:\n\n- BB (25%)\n\n- Bb (50%)\n\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, counting each occurrence:\n\n- Phenotype A: All cases except when Cc \u00d7 bb or cc \u00d7 BB or cc \u00d7 Bb occur. Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, each cell represents a combination. Each F2 bird is a combination of a C allele (dominant or recessive) and a B allele (dominant or recessive). So, for each F2 bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is dominant and/or B is dominant.\n\nLet me create a grid:\n\n- Rows: C (CC, Cc, cc) each at 25%\n- Columns: B (BB, Bb, bb) each at 25%\n\nEach cell represents a combination. For each cell, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- A: Cells 1-3, 4-5, 6 \u2192 Total 8 cells\n- B: Cell 6 \u2192 1 cell\n- C: Cells 7-8 \u2192 2 cells\n- D: Cell 9 \u2192 1 cell\n\nTotal: 8 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12 cells, which makes sense since there are 16 possible cells (4 rows \u00d7 4 columns).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nA : B : C : D = 8 : 1 : 2 : 1\n\nWait, but looking back, I thought earlier about different counts, but now this seems correct. So the ratio is 8 parts A, 1 part B, 2 parts C, and 1 part D. Let me check the options given.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2 \u2013 Not matching.\nB. 6:2:4:4 \u2013 No.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 No, because our calculation shows 8:1:2:1.\nD. 2:6:3:9 \u2013 No.\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No.\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 No.\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No, because our ratio is 8:1:2:1.\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No.\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 No.\n\nNone of the options match exactly. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, going back to the Punnett square construction. Maybe I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me go through each F2 bird and note their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nYes, that's 8 As, 1 B, 2 Cs, 1 D. So the ratio is 8:1:2:1. Looking at the options, none seem to match. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the F2 population consists of 16 birds. Among these, 8 have phenotype A, 1 has B, 2 have C, and 1 has D. So 8/16 = 50%, 1/16 \u22486.25%, 2/16 =12.5%, 1/16\u22486.25%. So the ratio is 8:1:2:1, which doesn't match any of the options directly.\n\nWait, looking at option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, which matches. But according to my calculation, the ratio is 8:1:2:1. So option H is different. Option G was 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't fit. Option E: 3:9:1:3, which doesn't align. Option F: 4:4:4:4, no. Option D: 2:6:3:9, no. Option C: 9:3:3:1, no. Option B: 6:2:4:4, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the mapping. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 A\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 B\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 C\n- Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 D\n\nThat's correct. Now, the numbers again: A:8, B:1, C:2, D:1. So 8:1:2:1. None of the options match this. But option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Which corresponds to a ratio of 5:3:2:6, adding up to 16. This doesn't match mine. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't match. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which is close but not the same. Option B is 6:2:4:4, which is off. Option D is 2:6:3:9, which is also different.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption. Let me reconsider the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 should have the following probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus: Each bird can have CC, Cc, or cc with probabilities 25%, 50%, 25%. Similarly for B locus: BB, Bb, or bb with 25%, 50%, 25%. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, the total number of possible combinations is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9 possible phenotypes, but many combinations lead to the same phenotype. Wait, actually, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratios can be calculated differently. Another approach is to consider the dominance hierarchy. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether the dominant alleles are present. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype X\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype Y\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype Z\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype W\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype X: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype Y: Only C present. Probability = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype Z: Only B present. Probability = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype W: Neither C nor B present. Probability = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But this contradicts my previous count of 8:1:2:1. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh! Wait a minute, in reality, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, since each gene is independently segregating, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts of Phenotype X, 3 parts of Phenotype Y, 3 parts of Phenotype Z, and 1 part of Phenotype W. But according to my earlier Punnett square analysis, I got 8:1:2:1. Which is conflicting.\n\nThis discrepancy arises because I might have miscounted the number of each phenotype in the Punnett square. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the Punnett square:\n\n- A: 8 instances\n- B: 1 instance\n- C: 2 instances\n- D: 1 instance\n\nWhich totals to 12 instances, but since each bird is diploid, this shouldn't happen. Wait, no\u2014each bird is represented by a single cell in the Punnett square, representing one bird. There are 16 possible birds in the F2 generation, so 16 cells. My earlier count added up to 8+1+2+1=12, which is inconsistent. Clearly, I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me redo the Punnett square properly. The F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of the F1 parents' gametes. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce gametes CB and cb (50% each). Therefore, the F2 will have 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations, each equally likely.\n\nNow, I'll list each possible genotype and determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 A\n3. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n4. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n5. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 C\n6. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 C\n7. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n8. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n9. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n10. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n11. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n12. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n13. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n14. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n15. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n16. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me structure it systematically:\n\nEach F2 bird is a combination of one allele from each parent. Each parent can contribute CB or cb. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB or cb\n- From Parent 2: CB or cb\n\nSo, each bird's genotype is the combination of these two alleles. The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nLet me list all possible genotype combinations and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n6. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n10. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n12. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n13. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n16. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's count:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,2,3,4,9,10,13,14 \u2192 8 instances\n- Phenotype B: None\n- Phenotype C: Cases 5,6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D: Cases 7,8,11,12,15,16 \u2192 6 instances\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous count. So Phenotype A appears 8 times, C appears 2 times, and D appears 6 times. That sums to 16 birds, which is correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 8:0:2:6, which simplifies to 4:0:1:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to match. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 6, 2, 4, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nWait, the correct ratio is 8:0:2:6. None of the options match exactly. However, option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't align with my numbers. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is a different ratio altogether.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the way I interpreted the genes. Let me revisit the problem statement.\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\nGene C: Checkered pigment control by C; red pigment by c\n\nGene B: Brown color by B; recessive by b\n\nSo, C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. The F2 generation comes from a cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb) bird.\n\nWait, hold on. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 generation will be CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (selfing) produces F2. The F2 generation will be the same as usual, with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, the parent with CC BB has C dominant, so it will pass on C for pigment and B dominant, making the F1 CcBb. The other parent has cc bb, so it will pass on c and b. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (ccbb) \u2192 F2.\n\nIn this case, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the two traits, leading to phenotypic ratios of:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9 parts\n\n- Phenotype B (only C present): 3 parts\n\n- Phenotype C (only B present): 3 parts\n\n- Phenotype D (neither C nor B present): 1 part\n\nBut this still doesn't align with any of the options given. However, the options don't have 9:3:3:1. The closest is option C: 9:3:3:1, but without the checkered phenotype. Wait, but the original question didn't mention checkered and plain as phenotypes; it only talks about C and c, and B and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses checkered (C) and plain (c) as the two phenotypes for pigment, and brown (B) and checkered (b) as the two phenotypes for color. So each bird has two traits, resulting in four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n\n2. C only \u2192 Phenotype B\n\n3. B only \u2192 Phenotype C\n\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAnd the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options provided, none match this exactly. However, option C is 9:3:3:1, but that includes checkered and plain for pigment, and",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present (probability 1/4)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the presence of C requires at least one dominant allele. The chance that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly for B. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present (but B is absent) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype C: Only B present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+1+1+1=12 parts out of 16. Wait, but that sums to 12/16, which leaves 4/16 unaccounted. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to look at each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to list all possible F2 genotypes and then convert them into phenotypes. The F2 genotypes will include combinations of CC, Cc, cc, and BB, Bb, bb. But since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, we need to map each genotype to its phenotype. Let me try constructing a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are: \n\n- CC (25%)\n\n- Cc (50%)\n\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor each of these, combined with the B alleles:\n\n- BB (25%)\n\n- Bb (50%)\n\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, counting each occurrence:\n\n- Phenotype A: All cases except when Cc \u00d7 bb or cc \u00d7 BB or cc \u00d7 Bb occur. Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, each cell represents a combination. Each F2 bird is a combination of a C allele (dominant or recessive) and a B allele (dominant or recessive). So, for each F2 bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is dominant and/or B is dominant.\n\nLet me create a grid:\n\n- Rows: C (CC, Cc, cc) each at 25%\n- Columns: B (BB, Bb, bb) each at 25%\n\nEach cell represents a combination. For each cell, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- A: Cells 1-3, 4-5, 6 \u2192 Total 8 cells\n- B: Cell 6 \u2192 1 cell\n- C: Cells 7-8 \u2192 2 cells\n- D: Cell 9 \u2192 1 cell\n\nTotal: 8 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12 cells, which makes sense since there are 16 possible cells (4 rows \u00d7 4 columns).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nA : B : C : D = 8 : 1 : 2 : 1\n\nWait, but looking back, I thought earlier about different counts, but now this seems correct. So the ratio is 8 parts A, 1 part B, 2 parts C, and 1 part D. Let me check the options given.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2 \u2013 Not matching.\nB. 6:2:4:4 \u2013 No.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 No, because our calculation shows 8:1:2:1.\nD. 2:6:3:9 \u2013 No.\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No.\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 No.\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No, because our ratio is 8:1:2:1.\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No.\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 No.\n\nNone of the options match exactly. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, going back to the Punnett square construction. Maybe I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me go through each F2 bird and note their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nYes, that's 8 As, 1 B, 2 Cs, 1 D. So the ratio is 8:1:2:1. Looking at the options, none seem to match. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the F2 population consists of 16 birds. Among these, 8 have phenotype A, 1 has B, 2 have C, and 1 has D. So 8/16 = 50%, 1/16 \u22486.25%, 2/16 =12.5%, 1/16\u22486.25%. So the ratio is 8:1:2:1, which doesn't match any of the options directly.\n\nWait, looking at option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, which matches. But according to my calculation, the ratio is 8:1:2:1. So option H is different. Option G was 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't fit. Option E: 3:9:1:3, which doesn't align. Option F: 4:4:4:4, no. Option D: 2:6:3:9, no. Option C: 9:3:3:1, no. Option B: 6:2:4:4, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the mapping. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 A\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 B\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 C\n- Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 D\n\nThat's correct. Now, the numbers again: A:8, B:1, C:2, D:1. So 8:1:2:1. None of the options match this. But option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Which corresponds to a ratio of 5:3:2:6, adding up to 16. This doesn't match mine. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't match. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which is close but not the same. Option B is 6:2:4:4, which is off. Option D is 2:6:3:9, which is also different.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption. Let me reconsider the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 should have the following probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus: Each bird can have CC, Cc, or cc with probabilities 25%, 50%, 25%. Similarly for B locus: BB, Bb, or bb with 25%, 50%, 25%. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, the total number of possible combinations is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9 possible phenotypes, but many combinations lead to the same phenotype. Wait, actually, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratios can be calculated differently. Another approach is to consider the dominance hierarchy. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether the dominant alleles are present. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype X\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype Y\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype Z\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype W\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype X: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype Y: Only C present. Probability = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype Z: Only B present. Probability = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype W: Neither C nor B present. Probability = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But this contradicts my previous count of 8:1:2:1. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh! Wait a minute, in reality, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, since each gene is independently segregating, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts of Phenotype X, 3 parts of Phenotype Y, 3 parts of Phenotype Z, and 1 part of Phenotype W. But according to my earlier Punnett square analysis, I got 8:1:2:1. Which is conflicting.\n\nThis discrepancy arises because I might have miscounted the number of each phenotype in the Punnett square. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the Punnett square:\n\n- A: 8 instances\n- B: 1 instance\n- C: 2 instances\n- D: 1 instance\n\nWhich totals to 12 instances, but since each bird is diploid, this shouldn't happen. Wait, no\u2014each bird is represented by a single cell in the Punnett square, representing one bird. There are 16 possible birds in the F2 generation, so 16 cells. My earlier count added up to 8+1+2+1=12, which is inconsistent. Clearly, I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me redo the Punnett square properly. The F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of the F1 parents' gametes. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce gametes CB and cb (50% each). Therefore, the F2 will have 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations, each equally likely.\n\nNow, I'll list each possible genotype and determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 A\n3. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n4. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n5. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 C\n6. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 C\n7. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n8. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n9. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n10. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n11. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n12. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n13. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n14. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 A\n15. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n16. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 D\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me structure it systematically:\n\nEach F2 bird is a combination of one allele from each parent. Each parent can contribute CB or cb. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB or cb\n- From Parent 2: CB or cb\n\nSo, each bird's genotype is the combination of these two alleles. The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nLet me list all possible genotype combinations and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n6. cb x CB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n10. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n12. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n13. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. CB x cb \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n16. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's count:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,2,3,4,9,10,13,14 \u2192 8 instances\n- Phenotype B: None\n- Phenotype C: Cases 5,6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D: Cases 7,8,11,12,15,16 \u2192 6 instances\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous count. So Phenotype A appears 8 times, C appears 2 times, and D appears 6 times. That sums to 16 birds, which is correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 8:0:2:6, which simplifies to 4:0:1:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to match. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 6, 2, 4, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nWait, the correct ratio is 8:0:2:6. None of the options match exactly. However, option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't align with my numbers. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is a different ratio altogether.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the way I interpreted the genes. Let me revisit the problem statement.\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\nGene C: Checkered pigment control by C; red pigment by c\n\nGene B: Brown color by B; recessive by b\n\nSo, C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. The F2 generation comes from a cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb) bird.\n\nWait, hold on. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 generation will be CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (selfing) produces F2. The F2 generation will be the same as usual, with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, the parent with CC BB has C dominant, so it will pass on C for pigment and B dominant, making the F1 CcBb. The other parent has cc bb, so it will pass on c and b. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (ccbb) \u2192 F2.\n\nIn this case, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the two traits, leading to phenotypic ratios of:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9 parts\n\n- Phenotype B (only C present): 3 parts\n\n- Phenotype C (only B present): 3 parts\n\n- Phenotype D (neither C nor B present): 1 part\n\nBut this still doesn't align with any of the options given. However, the options don't have 9:3:3:1. The closest is option C: 9:3:3:1, but without the checkered phenotype. Wait, but the original question didn't mention checkered and plain as phenotypes; it only talks about C and c, and B and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses checkered (C) and plain (c) as the two phenotypes for pigment, and brown (B) and checkered (b) as the two phenotypes for color. So each bird has two traits, resulting in four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n\n2. C only \u2192 Phenotype B\n\n3. B only \u2192 Phenotype C\n\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAnd the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options provided, none match this exactly. However, option C is 9:3:3:1, but that includes checkered and plain for pigment, and",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

    "rollout": " But that's not directly applicable because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects the other. Wait, no\u2014they don't interfere. So the correct calculation is: The number of birds that have both C and B dominant alleles. From the Punnett square of the F2, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A (both dominant): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): 3/16 (because 1/4 of the F2 are Cc, which are red, and among those, 1/4 have B recessive)\n- Phenotype C (B dominant, C recessive): 3/16 (similar logic)\n- Phenotype D (both recessive): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match this exact ratio.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But that's not directly applicable because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects the other. Wait, no\u2014they don't interfere. So the correct calculation is: The number of birds that have both C and B dominant alleles. From the Punnett square of the F2, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A (both dominant): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): 3/16 (because 1/4 of the F2 are Cc, which are red, and among those, 1/4 have B recessive)\n- Phenotype C (B dominant, C recessive): 3/16 (similar logic)\n- Phenotype D (both recessive): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match this exact ratio. The closest option seems to be option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which matches our calculations. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, for each class:\n\nClass A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nClass D: Both C and B absent \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Which matches our calculation. So the answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. - Probability for C: 3/4\n- Probability for B: 1/4 (since only 25% of the birds have B absent)\nSo combined, 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present. - Probability for C: 1/4\n- Probability for B: 3/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nClass D: Both C and B absent. - Probability for C: 1/4\n- Probability for B: 1/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\nClass A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\nClass B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass D: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 for phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively.\nLooking back at the options, option C states the ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the options don't directly match.

Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, none seem exactly matching. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly reflect this.

Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich corresponds to 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

    "rollout": " Wait, but this seems incorrect because each bird's phenotype isn't just based on both genes being present; it's based on each gene individually. Actually, the correct way is to consider each trait separately and then combine them. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 3/4 (since any C allele makes it red), and the probability that it has brown is also 3/4 (since any B allele makes it brown). Since these are independent, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having red and checkered is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. The probability of plain and brown is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Finally, the probability of plain and checkered is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which checks out.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but this seems incorrect because each bird's phenotype isn't just based on both genes being present; it's based on each gene individually. Actually, the correct way is to consider each trait separately and then combine them. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 3/4 (since any C allele makes it red), and the probability that it has brown is also 3/4 (since any B allele makes it brown). Since these are independent, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having red and checkered is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. The probability of plain and brown is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Finally, the probability of plain and checkered is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nPhenotype A: 9 parts\nPhenotype B: 3 parts\nPhenotype C: 3 parts\nPhenotype D: 1 part\n\nTotal: 16 parts\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Yes, this matches our calculation.\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Inverses.\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Also inverses.\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equally expressed.\nG. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Correct.\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together. So instead, we should calculate the number of birds that have each combination.

Since each bird has two independent genes, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor Phenotype A (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the combined probability isn't simply the product. Instead, it's the probability that both C and B are present in the bird. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together, the correct approach is to count the number of phenotypes in the Punnett square.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square method for dihybrids, the F2 generation will have 16 possible combinations of the four letters (CB, cb, cB, cb). But since the parents are homozygous, each will produce only one type of gamete, leading to a simplified Punnett square. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the correct gametes are CB and cb because each parent is heterozygous for both genes. So each parent can produce two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. Thus, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, since each gene is independent, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, but due to the independence, each combination occurs with a certain frequency. Let me construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach parent produces gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%). So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele), then it is red.\n- If B is present (at least one B allele), then it is brown.\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant state. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered Now, we need to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent is CcBb and selfs, the F2 will have a distribution based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), but since the presence of each trait is determined by at least one dominant allele, the overall phenotypic ratio is calculated differently. Alternatively, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): This requires at least one C and at least one B allele. The probability of this happening is calculated by subtracting the probabilities of the other three scenarios. Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the complementary probabilities. The probability of missing at least one dominant allele (i.e., all C or all B) is:\n\n  - All C: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n  - All B: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n  - Total: 10/16 = 5/8\n  - Therefore, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is 1 - 5/8 = 3/8\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach is flawed because the presence of C and B is not mutually exclusive. Instead, the correct approach is to realize that for a bird to have both C and B present, it must have at least one C and at least one B allele. The probability of this is calculated as:\n\n- Number of ways to have at least one C and at least one B: Total possible combinations minus those without C or without B.\n\nTotal possible combinations for each bird: 4 (since each bird has two alleles for each gene, but we're looking at the presence of dominant alleles, so each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene).\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to realize that for each bird, the presence of C and B is independent. The probability of having at least one C is 3/4, and similarly for B. But since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. However, this counts the cases where both C and B are present, which is what we want for Phenotype 1.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): Requires at least one C and none B. The probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): Requires none C and at least one B. The probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Requires neither C nor B. The probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo adding these up:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nTotal: 16/16 = 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together. So instead, we should calculate the number of birds that have each combination. Alternatively, since each bird's phenotype depends on both traits, we can create a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Presence | B Presence\n--- | --- | ---\nA | Yes | Yes\nB | Yes | No\nC | No | Yes\nD | No | No\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the possible combinations of C and B alleles. Since each bird has two independent genes, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor Phenotype A (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the combined probability isn't simply the product. Instead, it's the probability that both C and B are present in the bird. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together, the correct approach is to count the number of phenotypes in the Punnett square.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square method for dihybrids, the F2 generation will have 16 possible combinations of the four letters (CB, cb, cB, cb). But since the parents are homozygous, each will produce only one type of gamete, leading to a simplified Punnett square. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the correct gametes are CB and cb because each parent is heterozygous for both genes. So each parent can produce two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. Thus, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, since each gene is independent, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, but due to the independence, each combination occurs with a certain frequency. Let me construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach parent produces gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%). So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele), then it is red.\n- If B is present (at least one B allele), then it is brown.\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant state. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered Now, we need to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent is CcBb and selfs, the F2 will have a distribution based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), but since the presence of each trait is determined by at least one dominant allele, the overall phenotypic ratio is calculated differently. Alternatively, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): This requires at least one C and at least one B allele. The probability of this happening is calculated by subtracting the probabilities of the other three scenarios. Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the complementary probabilities. The probability of missing at least one dominant allele (i.e., all C or all B) is:\n\n  - All C: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n  - All B: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n  - Total: 10/16 = 5/8\n  - Therefore, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is 1 - 5/8 = 3/8\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach is flawed because the presence of C and B is not mutually exclusive. Instead, the correct approach is to realize that for a bird to have both C and B present, it must have at least one C and at least one B allele. The probability of this is calculated as:\n\n- Number of ways to have at least one C and at least one B: Total possible combinations minus those without C or without B.\n\nTotal possible combinations for each bird: 4 (since each bird has two alleles for each gene, but we're looking at the presence of dominant alleles, so each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene).\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to realize that for each bird, the presence of C and B is independent. The probability of having at least one C is 3/4, and similarly for B. But since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. However, this counts the cases where both C and B are present, which is what we want for Phenotype 1.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): Requires at least one C and none B. The probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): Requires none C and at least one B. The probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Requires neither C nor B. The probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo adding these up:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nTotal: 16/16 = 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which corresponds to our calculation (9:3:3:1). So option G matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but this seems off because each bird can only have certain combinations of C and B. Alternatively, let's list all possible combinations:\n\nPhenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n\nNumber of such cases: 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9, but since each bird has two traits, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes over total. Total possible combinations: 4 (as above). Phenotype A occurs when both C and B are present, which is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Occurs when C is present but B is not.\n\nThis happens when C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (Plain and Brown): Occurs when C is absent but B is present.\n\nC absent is 1/4, B present is 3/4. So probability is (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Occurs when neither C nor B is present.\n\nC absent is 1/4, B absent is 1/4. So probability is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nA: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\nB: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nC: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nD: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nOption C matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not exactly right because each bird has two traits, so the combined probability isn't simply the product of individual probabilities. Instead, we should consider the possible combinations. Let me approach it differently. For each bird, the number of possible combinations is 2^2 = 4, as before. But since the phenotypes are based on dominant alleles, the number of phenotypic classes is 4. Now, let's calculate the frequency of each class in the F2 population. For the C locus:\n\nPhenotype Present | Frequency\n--- | ---\nC | 3/4\nc | 1/4\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\nB | 3/4\nb | 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are products. So:\n\nClass A (C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nClass B (C present, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nClass C (C absent, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nClass D (both absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which simplifies to 9 parts red-brown, 3 parts red-checkered, 3 parts plain-brown, and 1 part plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" This matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Wait, looking back, the answer choices list various ratios, including option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which sums up to 16, matching our ratio. So the correct ratio is 3:9:1:3, which aligns with option E. Because in the ratio, checkered red is 3 parts, checkered brown is 9, plain red is 1, plain brown is 3. This adds up to 16, which matches the denominator in our calculation. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. - Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only 1/4 have bb)\nSo combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present. - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nClass D: Neither C nor B present. - Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are based on these probabilities: A : B : C : D = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 Total parts = 16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't match our calculation. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let me re-express the ratios. A is red and brown, which corresponds to both genes being present, so 9 parts.\nB is red and checkered (C present, B absent), 3 parts.\nC is plain and brown (C absent, B present), 3 parts.\nD is plain and checkered (neither present), 1 part.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, none directly match this except option H, which is 5,3,2,6. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the logic. Another approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered (both recessive) | No | No | 1/16\nPlain (non-checkered) | No | Yes | 3/16\nRed (at least one dominant) | Yes | No | 3/16\nRed & Checkered (both dominant) | Yes | Yes | 9/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the answer choices perfectly match this, but option E has a different distribution. Wait, looking back, the answer choices list various ratios, including option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which sums up to 16, matching our ratio. So the correct ratio is 3:9:1:3, which aligns with option E. Because in the ratio, checkered red is 3 parts, checkered brown is 9, plain red is 1, plain brown is 3. This adds up to 16, which matches the denominator in our calculation. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. - Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since 25% Bb and 25% bb)\nSo combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Class C: C absent, B present. - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into ratios:\n\nClass A: 9/16\nClass B: 3/16\nClass C: 3/16\nClass D: 1/16\n\nTotal parts: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2014 Doesn\u2019t match.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2014 Doesn't match.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 Matches our calculation.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2014 Opposite ratios.\nE.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014this approach overcounts because the presence of C and B together doesn't necessarily mean both traits are present unless both are dominant. Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability of each phenotype directly.\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B are present.\n- This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B allele.\n- The probability of having at least one C: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- The probability of having at least one B: 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Since these are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. So Phenotype A: 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since bb)\n- Combined probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present.\n- Probability of neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nNow, adding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16=1. Correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3. But our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which is different. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, so invalid. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2:6:3:1, sum 12, which is wrong. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2, which is 3:1:3:1, but our is 9:3:3:1. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4, which is 2:1:0:1, not matching. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 which matches exactly what we calculated. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So Phenotype A: 9/16.",
    "rollout": " So Phenotype A: 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is not (1/4). So probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Class C: C absent, B present. This is when C is not present (1/4) and B is present (3/4). So probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. This is when C is not present (1/4) and B is not present (1/4). So probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Now, convert these fractions to percentages: A: 9/16 = 56.25%, B: 3/16 = 18.75%, C: 3/16 = 18.75%, D: 1/16 = 6.25%. But looking at the options given, none directly match this calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the rules. Let me try another approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The presence of a dominant allele in a gene results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird has two independent traits, each determined by one gene. The chance of each trait is as follows:\n\nFor C:\n- Present (C_) : 3/4 (since \u00be of the population has at least one dominant C)\n- Absent (cc) : \u00bc\n\nFor B:\n- Present (B_) : 3/4\n- Absent (bb) : \u00bc\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but this is under the assumption that each trait is present independently. However, when considering the actual presence of the trait in the phenotype, the probabilities align with this ratio. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems reversed. According to our calculations, checkered red (which is when both genes are recessive, i.e., plain and checkered) should be 1/16, which is 1 part. But wait, the phenotype checkered is plain and checkered, which corresponds to both genes being recessive, so that's 1/16. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, Phenotype D is both genes recessive, so that's 1/16 plain and checkered. But the options list Phenotype 4 as plain brown, which contradicts that. Hmm, confusion arises because in the options, the phenotypes are labeled differently. Maybe I messed up the labels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the labels are swapped. Let me double-check:\n\nIf \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype for both genes, then checkered is both genes recessive \u2192 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, plain and brown would be one dominant, one recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is plain (c) and brown (B), that's the presence of B but not C. So that's phenotype 2: Red and checkered.\n\nSimilarly, plain and checkered would be presence of c and b, which is phenotype 4: plain and checkered.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with my earlier analysis. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. The labels in the options may be confusing. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So according to this, the checkered red is 9 parts, which would correspond to both genes recessive (c and b), making 1/16. Similarly, checkered brown would be presence of b but not C, which is (C present, b present). Which is 3/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching because (C present, b present) is 3/16, which would be brown and plain (since C is present, it's red, and b makes it plain).\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Let me approach this methodically. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 presence of C allele\n- Body color brown (B) \u2192 presence of B allele\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and checkered (C absent, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird has two independent traits, each determined by one gene.\n\nFor a bird to be Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown), both C and B must be present. The probability of C being present is 3/4 (since any C allele expresses red), and similarly, B being present is 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the joint probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered), C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). Joint probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown), C is absent (1/4) and B is present (3/4). Joint probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered), both C and B are absent. Joint probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the denominator in the options.\n\nNow, the options label the phenotypes as:\n\n- checkered red: checkered red would be plain and checkered, which is 1/16.\n- checkered brown: presence of B but not C, which is 3/16.\n- plain red: presence of C but not B, which is 3/16.\n- plain brown: presence of both, which is 9/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- checkered red (plain and checkered) \u2192 1\n- checkered brown (red and checkered) \u2192 3\n- plain red (red and plain) \u2192 3\n- plain brown (both red and brown) \u2192 9\n\nWait, no. Because checkered red is plain and checkered, which is phenotype 4 (1/16), checkered brown is phenotype 2 (3/16), plain red is phenotype 3 (3/16), and plain brown is phenotype 1 (9/16). So the order in the ratio should be:\n\n- checkered red (1) : checkered brown (3) : plain red (3) : plain brown (9)\n\nWhich matches option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. So Phenotype A: 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is not (1/4). So probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Class C: C absent, B present. This is when C is not present (1/4) and B is present (3/4). So probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. This is when C is not present (1/4) and B is not present (1/4). So probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Now, convert these fractions to percentages: A: 9/16 = 56.25%, B: 3/16 = 18.75%, C: 3/16 = 18.75%, D: 1/16 = 6.25%. But looking at the options given, none directly match this calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the rules. Let me try another approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The presence of a dominant allele in a gene results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird has two independent traits, each determined by one gene. The chance of each trait is as follows:\n\nFor C:\n- Present (C_) : 3/4 (since \u00be of the population has at least one dominant C)\n- Absent (cc) : \u00bc\n\nFor B:\n- Present (B_) : 3/4\n- Absent (bb) : \u00bc\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but this is under the assumption that each trait is present independently. However, when considering the actual presence of the trait in the phenotype, the probabilities align with this ratio. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems reversed. According to our calculations, checkered red (which is when both genes are recessive, i.e., plain and checkered) should be 1/16, which is 1 part. But wait, the phenotype checkered is plain and checkered, which corresponds to both genes being recessive, so that's 1/16. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, Phenotype D is both genes recessive, so that's 1/16 plain and checkered. But the options list Phenotype 4 as plain brown, which contradicts that. Hmm, confusion arises because in the options, the phenotypes are labeled differently. Maybe I messed up the labels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the labels are swapped. Let me double-check:\n\nIf \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype for both genes, then checkered is both genes recessive \u2192 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, plain and brown would be one dominant, one recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is plain (c) and brown (B), that's the presence of B but not C. So that's phenotype 2: Red and checkered.\n\nSimilarly, plain and checkered would be presence of c and b, which is phenotype 4: plain and checkered.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with my earlier analysis. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. The labels in the options may be confusing. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So according to this, the checkered red is 9 parts, which would correspond to both genes recessive (c and b), making 1/16. Similarly, checkered brown would be presence of b but not C, which is (C present, b present). Which is 3/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching because (C present, b present) is 3/16, which would be brown and plain (since C is present, it's red, and b makes it plain).\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Let me approach this methodically. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 presence of C allele\n- Body color brown (B) \u2192 presence of B allele\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and checkered (C absent, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird has two independent traits, each determined by one gene.\n\nFor a bird to be Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown), both C and B must be present. The probability of C being present is 3/4 (since any C allele expresses red), and similarly, B being present is 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the joint probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered), C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). Joint probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown), C is absent (1/4) and B is present (3/4). Joint probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered), both C and B are absent. Joint probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the denominator in the options.\n\nNow, the options label the phenotypes as:\n\n- checkered red: checkered red would be plain and checkered, which is 1/16.\n- checkered brown: presence of B but not C, which is 3/16.\n- plain red: presence of C but not B, which is 3/16.\n- plain brown: presence of both, which is 9/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- checkered red (plain and checkered) \u2192 1\n- checkered brown (red and checkered) \u2192 3\n- plain red (red and plain) \u2192 3\n- plain brown (both red and brown) \u2192 9\n\nWait, no. Because checkered red is plain and checkered, which is phenotype 4 (1/16), checkered brown is phenotype 2 (3/16), plain red is phenotype 3 (3/16), and plain brown is phenotype 1 (9/16). So the order in the ratio should be:\n\n- checkered red (1) : checkered brown (3) : plain red (3) : plain brown (9)\n\nWhich matches option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability for each class:\n\nClass A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nClass D: Both C and B absent \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype A (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present.\n- Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B (Red and Checkered): C is present, B is absent.\n- Probability = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C (Plain and Brown): C is absent, B is present.\n- Probability = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Neither C nor B is present.\n- Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers by multiplying by 16:\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which seems different. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". Hmm, none seem to match my calculation directly. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The F2 generation should have a 9:3:3:1 ratio according to Mendelian inheritance, but in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the parents are homozygous, the ratio should indeed follow that. However, the options don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nNone of these options match 9:3:3:1 exactly. Perhaps the question is asking for the F1 instead of F2? But the question specifies F2. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy: C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. Therefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- All birds will have both traits unless they lack the dominant allele for one. Wait, no\u2014because each trait is determined independently by the gene. So a bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n- Checkered (c) and plain (c): Phenotype J (plain and checkered)\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Plain (c) and plain (c): Phenotype K (plain and checkered)\n\nWait, but the options don't mention D, E, J, or K. So perhaps the question is expecting us to count the number of each phenotype without considering the others, but that doesn't fit the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but the options list F2 ratios. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the F2 ratio. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by the selfing of F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, let's categorize each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, Phenotype A occurs 3 times, and Phenotype D occurs once. Total of 4 phenotypes. But the options don't list 3:1 ratios. Wait, perhaps the question is only interested in the F1 phenotypes, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 generation's phenotypes. F1 is CcBb, which can be categorized as:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Pigment red (C)\n- 25% Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C)\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain (c)\n- 25% BB \u2192 Brown (B)\n- 25% Bb \u2192 Brown (B)\n- 25% bb \u2192 Checkered (b)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red\n- Plain\n- Brown\n- Checkered\n\nWith the following distribution:\n- Pigment red: 50%\n- Plain: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nThis sums up to 100%, but the options don't reflect this. Looking back at the options, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which adds up to 16, which is higher than the population size (16 individuals). So that can't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation with a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 individuals. But the options provided don't align with what I've calculated. Wait, let me recount the F2 phenotypes based on the Punnett square. Each of the four F2 genotypes (as listed earlier) corresponds to one bird, so:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, Phenotype A occurs 3 times, Phenotype D once. So the ratio is 3:1. But this still doesn't match any of the options except for option G, which is 9:3:3:1, but that's the F1 ratio, not F2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Based on standard Mendelian inheritance with independent genes, the F2 should have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in this case, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 should have the same ratio. But the options provided do not include 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't add up to 16. Wait, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014totaling 16. But that would imply that none of the birds in F2 have the plain brown phenotype, which contradicts our earlier analysis since a bird can have both traits unless they lack the dominant allele for both.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, does that mean that C is the dominant allele for pigment and c is recessive, making C the dominant pigment gene, while c is the recessive color gene? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, gene C is responsible for both pigment color (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain) and gene B is responsible for color (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered). Wait, that's conflicting. Because typically, a single gene would control both traits, but here, it seems like two separate genes are acting. So, each bird has two genes: one for pigment (C and c) and one for color (B and b). So, for pigment, C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). For color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So, a bird's phenotype is determined by both genes: if C is present, it's red; if B is present, it's brown. So, a bird can have both traits unless it lacks the dominant allele for one. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because the presence of dominant alleles in either gene would express that trait. So, the actual phenotypes would be determined by the combination of both traits. For example, a bird could have pigment red and brown (both dominant), or pigment red and checkered (only B is dominant), or pigment plain and brown, or plain and checkered.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which totals 16. This suggests that all birds in F2 have either checkered (c) or plain (cc), but that's not possible because some birds will have both traits due to the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, which would be 2:2 (pigment red vs plain, and brown vs checkered). But in the options, option B is 8:4:0:4, which is different. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypes, not F2. Let me recast the problem: the question is about the F2 generation, but the options refer to the F1 generation. That would explain why the answer is option B, which has 8:4:0:4. Wait, no\u2014the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio would be determined by the F1's ability to express the traits.\n\nIn F1, the genotype is CcBb. The phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (pigment red) and B is present (brown). So:\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- B present \u2192 brown\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (phenotype A)\n2. Red and Checkered (phenotype B)\n3. Plain and Brown (phenotype C)\n4. Plain and Checkered (phenotype D)\n\nThe ratio of these would be:\n\nPhenotype A: C present (3/4) and B present (3/4) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present (3/4) and B absent (1/4) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent (1/4) and B present (3/4) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: C absent (1/4) and B absent (1/4) \u2192 1/16\n\nTotal 16 birds, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But this is for F2. However, the options provided don't include this. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, which is 2:2 (pigment red vs plain, brown vs checkered). So the ratio would be 8:4 (if considering red and plain, brown and checkered), but that's not matching any option. Alternatively, the question might have mixed up F1 and F2, leading to confusion.\n\nLooking back, the options provided are for F2. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16, suggesting that all birds in F2 have either checkered or plain colors, but this contradicts the fact that some birds will have both traits. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the options, but since I have to choose, option G seems to represent a 9:3:3:1 ratio, possibly for F2, but it's written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: the question might be considering the F2 generation's phenotypic expression based on the F1's genotypes, but that wouldn't change the overall ratio. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to ignore dominance and assume complete dominance, which would change the ratio significantly. If dominance were complete, then:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 all red\n- Plain (c) \u2192 all plain\n- Brown (B) \u2192 all brown\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 all checkered\n\nThen, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C)\n2. Plain (c)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Checkered (b)\n\nThe ratio would be 4:0:0:0, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, considering dominance as complete, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Any bird with C \u2192 Red\n- Any bird with B \u2192 Brown\n- Any bird with both C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n- Any bird with neither \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nBut under complete dominance, the ratio becomes 4:0:0:0, which isn't an option. Therefore, I must stick to the assumption that the traits are expressed based on dominant alleles, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for F2.\n\nSince none of the options perfectly match this, but option G is the closest, albeit incorrectly presented, I think the intended answer was option G, despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Another angle: the question mentions F2 generation, but the options refer to F1. If that's the case, then the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio would be 2:2, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up F1 and F2, and the intended answer is option B, which is 8:4:0:4, implying a 1:1:0:0 ratio for pigments and brown vs checkered, but that doesn't align with F2 expectations.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the best choice is option G, despite the mismatched wording.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but this counts all cases where both traits are expressed. However, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present. So the actual number of phenotypic classes isn't straightforward because some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of traits. So each bird will have exactly one phenotype, depending on the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype A (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present.\n- Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B (Red and Checkered): C is present, B is absent.\n- Probability = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C (Plain and Brown): C is absent, B is present.\n- Probability = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Neither C nor B is present.\n- Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers by multiplying by 16:\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which seems different. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". Hmm, none seem to match my calculation directly. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The F2 generation should have a 9:3:3:1 ratio according to Mendelian inheritance, but in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the parents are homozygous, the ratio should indeed follow that. However, the options don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nNone of these options match 9:3:3:1 exactly. Perhaps the question is asking for the F1 instead of F2? But the question specifies F2. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy: C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. Therefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- All birds will have both traits unless they lack the dominant allele for one. Wait, no\u2014because each trait is determined independently by the gene. So a bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n- Checkered (c) and plain (c): Phenotype J (plain and checkered)\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Plain (c) and plain (c): Phenotype K (plain and checkered)\n\nWait, but the options don't mention D, E, J, or K. So perhaps the question is expecting us to count the number of each phenotype without considering the others, but that doesn't fit the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but the options list F2 ratios. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the F2 ratio. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by the selfing of F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, let's categorize each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, Phenotype A occurs 3 times, and Phenotype D occurs once. Total of 4 phenotypes. But the options don't list 3:1 ratios. Wait, perhaps the question is only interested in the F1 phenotypes, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 generation's phenotypes. F1 is CcBb, which can be categorized as:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Pigment red (C)\n- 25% Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C)\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain (c)\n- 25% BB \u2192 Brown (B)\n- 25% Bb \u2192 Brown (B)\n- 25% bb \u2192 Checkered (b)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red\n- Plain\n- Brown\n- Checkered\n\nWith the following distribution:\n- Pigment red: 50%\n- Plain: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nThis sums up to 100%, but the options don't reflect this. Looking back at the options, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which adds up to 16, which is higher than the population size (16 individuals). So that can't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation with a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 individuals. But the options provided don't align with what I've calculated. Wait, let me recount the F2 phenotypes based on the Punnett square. Each of the four F2 genotypes (as listed earlier) corresponds to one bird, so:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, Phenotype A occurs 3 times, Phenotype D once. So the ratio is 3:1. But this still doesn't match any of the options except for option G, which is 9:3:3:1, but that's the F1 ratio, not F2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Based on standard Mendelian inheritance with independent genes, the F2 should have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in this case, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 should have the same ratio. But the options provided do not include 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't add up to 16. Wait, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014totaling 16. But that would imply that none of the birds in F2 have the plain brown phenotype, which contradicts our earlier analysis since a bird can have both traits unless they lack the dominant allele for both.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, does that mean that C is the dominant allele for pigment and c is recessive, making C the dominant pigment gene, while c is the recessive color gene? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, gene C is responsible for both pigment color (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain) and gene B is responsible for color (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered). Wait, that's conflicting. Because typically, a single gene would control both traits, but here, it seems like two separate genes are acting. So, each bird has two genes: one for pigment (C and c) and one for color (B and b). So, for pigment, C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). For color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So, a bird's phenotype is determined by both genes: if C is present, it's red; if B is present, it's brown. So, a bird can have both traits unless it lacks the dominant allele for one. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because the presence of dominant alleles in either gene would express that trait. So, the actual phenotypes would be determined by the combination of both traits. For example, a bird could have pigment red and brown (both dominant), or pigment red and checkered (only B is dominant), or pigment plain and brown, or plain and checkered.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which totals 16. This suggests that all birds in F2 have either checkered (c) or plain (cc), but that's not possible because some birds will have both traits due to the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, which would be 2:2 (pigment red vs plain, and brown vs checkered). But in the options, option B is 8:4:0:4, which is different. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypes, not F2. Let me recast the problem: the question is about the F2 generation, but the options refer to the F1 generation. That would explain why the answer is option B, which has 8:4:0:4. Wait, no\u2014the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio would be determined by the F1's ability to express the traits.\n\nIn F1, the genotype is CcBb. The phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (pigment red) and B is present (brown). So:\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- B present \u2192 brown\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (phenotype A)\n2. Red and Checkered (phenotype B)\n3. Plain and Brown (phenotype C)\n4. Plain and Checkered (phenotype D)\n\nThe ratio of these would be:\n\nPhenotype A: C present (3/4) and B present (3/4) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present (3/4) and B absent (1/4) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent (1/4) and B present (3/4) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: C absent (1/4) and B absent (1/4) \u2192 1/16\n\nTotal 16 birds, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But this is for F2. However, the options provided don't include this. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, which is 2:2 (pigment red vs plain, brown vs checkered). So the ratio would be 8:4 (if considering red and plain, brown and checkered), but that's not matching any option. Alternatively, the question might have mixed up F1 and F2, leading to confusion.\n\nLooking back, the options provided are for F2. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16, suggesting that all birds in F2 have either checkered or plain colors, but this contradicts the fact that some birds will have both traits. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the options, but since I have to choose, option G seems to represent a 9:3:3:1 ratio, possibly for F2, but it's written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: the question might be considering the F2 generation's phenotypic expression based on the F1's genotypes, but that wouldn't change the overall ratio. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to ignore dominance and assume complete dominance, which would change the ratio significantly. If dominance were complete, then:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 all red\n- Plain (c) \u2192 all plain\n- Brown (B) \u2192 all brown\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 all checkered\n\nThen, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C)\n2. Plain (c)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Checkered (b)\n\nThe ratio would be 4:0:0:0, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, considering dominance as complete, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Any bird with C \u2192 Red\n- Any bird with B \u2192 Brown\n- Any bird with both C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n- Any bird with neither \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nBut under complete dominance, the ratio becomes 4:0:0:0, which isn't an option. Therefore, I must stick to the assumption that the traits are expressed based on dominant alleles, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for F2.\n\nSince none of the options perfectly match this, but option G is the closest, albeit incorrectly presented, I think the intended answer was option G, despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Another angle: the question mentions F2 generation, but the options refer to F1. If that's the case, then the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio would be 2:2, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up F1 and F2, and the intended answer is option B, which is 8:4:0:4, implying a 1:1:0:0 ratio for pigments and brown vs checkered, but that doesn't align with F2 expectations.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the best choice is option G, despite the mismatched wording.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but that's not quite right because the presence of C and B are independent, so the combined probability is indeed (prob C) * (prob B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but that's not quite right because the presence of C and B are independent, so the combined probability is indeed (prob C) * (prob B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, for Class B: C present, B absent. This requires C to be present (which is 3/4) and B absent (which is 1/4). So the probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass C: C absent, B present. This is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present. This is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is the number of each class relative to the others. So:\n\nPhenotype A: 9/16\nPhenotype B: 3/16\nPhenotype C: 3/16\nPhenotype D: 1/16\n\nAdding up, 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because the presence of C and B are independent, so the combined probability is indeed (prob C) * (prob B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, for Class B: C present, B absent. This requires C to be present (which is 3/4) and B absent (which is 1/4). So the probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass C: C absent, B present. This is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present. This is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is the number of each class relative to the others. So:\n\nPhenotype A: 9/16\nPhenotype B: 3/16\nPhenotype C: 3/16\nPhenotype D: 1/16\n\nAdding up, 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense. Therefore, the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, but looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again. Hmm, the options given are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nLooking back at our calculation, the phenotypic ratio was 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, but in terms of counts, it's 9, 3, 3, 1. Wait, but that adds up to 16. Looking at option G, it says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's different. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Yes! Because 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. So that's option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014this approach counts all possible combinations, including those where either or both are missing. Wait, no\u2014since each bird's phenotype depends on both traits, the correct approach is to look at the distribution across the four phenotypic classes.\n\nAlternatively, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n- All birds where C is present (3/4) and B is present (3/4) \u2192 Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Birds with C present and B absent: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- Birds without C but with B: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- Birds without C and without B: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, checking the math: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. Now, looking back at the options provided, I need to match these calculations to the given answer choices. Let me go through each option:\n\nOption E says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) : 3, D (plain and checkered) :1, A (red and brown):9, B (red and checkered):3. This matches our calculation: 3+1=4 phenotypic classes, with the counts as above. So Option E seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's the probability that a bird has both traits, but our classes are based on which traits are present, not the sum. Alternatively, each bird's phenotype can be determined by the combination of traits, so:\n\nClass A: Both C and B \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4? Wait, no\u2014because each bird has two traits, each determined independently. The probability that a bird has both C and B dominant is (prob C) * (prob B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C dominant (and not B) is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Same for only B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And only c (plain) and b (checkered): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. So the four phenotypes have probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nNow, looking back at the options given in the problem, none of them seem to match this exact distribution. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 This seems arbitrary and possibly incorrect.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Hmm, 8+4=12, but total is 16?\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16? Let me add them up: 9+3+3+1=16. That makes sense.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, option C says 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, totaling 16. Option D is 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Option G is 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. Option H is 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown. Option I is 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, the correct probabilities are 9/16 checkered red, 3/16 checkered brown, 3/16 plain red, 1/16 plain brown. Which corresponds to option C: 9, 3, 3, 1. Alternatively, option D sums to 16 but with different numbers. But according to the calculations, option C is correct. However, let me double-check the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the probabilities. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nThese correspond to the four phenotypes. Looking at the options, option C matches exactly: 9, 3, 3, 1. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right because the presence of a dominant allele doesn\u2019t directly translate to the probability of having the trait.",
    "rollout": " Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right because the presence of a dominant allele doesn\u2019t directly translate to the probability of having the trait. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So the number of phenotypic classes is 4, but the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these. Let me instead count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Each gene has 3 phenotypic outcomes (dominant or recessive for each gene). Since the two genes are independent, the total phenotypic combinations are 3 x 3 = 9. However, some combinations may not be possible due to overlapping traits. Wait, no\u2014the combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to certain numbers of individuals in the F2 population. To find the exact counts, we can look up the standard Punnett square for dihybrids. The typical ratio for dihybrid crosses is 9:3:3:1, representing the four phenotypic classes. However, depending on the dominance relationships, some classes may overlap or reduce in size. In this case, each bird will have exactly one dominant allele for each gene, so all four phenotypes are possible. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Adding up to 16, so the fractions are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 for each class respectively.\n\nNow, applying this to our scenario: Phenotype 1 (both C and B present) occurs 9 times. Phenotype 2 (C present, B absent) occurs 3 times. Phenotype 3 (C absent, B present) also occurs 3 times. Phenotype 4 (both absent) occurs once. However, looking back at the options given, none of them match this ratio. The closest option seems to be G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Wait, that doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation rather than F2, but the user included F2 in their options. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, but the options don't include the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe user's question mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They then provide a Punnett square setup but seem to list F2 as the target. But in the options, I don't see the 9:3:3:1 ratio. The closest option is G, which has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. But according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the expected phenotypic distribution would be approximately 9 out of 16 checkered red, 3 out of 16 checkered brown, 3 out of 16 plain red, and 1 out of 16 plain brown. None of the options match this exactly. However, looking closer, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. Because the F1 would be CcBb, and its phenotypes would be based on the dominant alleles. For F1, the possible phenotypes are: \n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown (since C is present, B is present)\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered plain\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Brown plain\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nIn terms of phenotypic ratios, the F1 would have 100%, but since all birds would have both traits expressed, but the question is about the F2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 phenotypes, but none of the options seem to fit.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right because the presence of a dominant allele doesn\u2019t directly translate to the probability of having the trait. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So the number of phenotypic classes is 4, but the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these. Let me instead count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Each gene has 3 phenotypic outcomes (dominant or recessive for each gene). Since the two genes are independent, the total phenotypic combinations are 3 x 3 = 9. However, some combinations may not be possible due to overlapping traits. Wait, no\u2014the combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to certain numbers of individuals in the F2 population. To find the exact counts, we can look up the standard Punnett square for dihybrids. The typical ratio for dihybrid crosses is 9:3:3:1, representing the four phenotypic classes. However, depending on the dominance relationships, some classes may overlap or reduce in size. In this case, each bird will have exactly one dominant allele for each gene, so all four phenotypes are possible. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Adding up to 16, so the fractions are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 for each class respectively.\n\nNow, applying this to our scenario: Phenotype 1 (both C and B present) occurs 9 times. Phenotype 2 (C present, B absent) occurs 3 times. Phenotype 3 (C absent, B present) also occurs 3 times. Phenotype 4 (both absent) occurs once. However, looking back at the options given, none of them match this ratio. The closest option seems to be G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Wait, that doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation rather than F2, but the user included F2 in their options. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, but the options don't include the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe user's question mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They then provide a Punnett square setup but seem to list F2 as the target. But in the options, I don't see the 9:3:3:1 ratio. The closest option is G, which has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. But according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the expected phenotypic distribution would be approximately 9 out of 16 checkered red, 3 out of 16 checkered brown, 3 out of 16 plain red, and 1 out of 16 plain brown. None of the options match this exactly. However, looking closer, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. Because the F1 would be CcBb, and its phenotypes would be based on the dominant alleles. For F1, the possible phenotypes are: \n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown (since C is present, B is present)\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered plain\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Brown plain\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nIn terms of phenotypic ratios, the F1 would have 100%, but since all birds would have both traits expressed, but the question is about the F2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 phenotypes, but none of the options seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and intended the F1 to be considered, but in that case, the phenotypic ratios wouldn't split into four distinct groups as in the F2.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.",

Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown (Phenotype A): 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered (Phenotype B): 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown (Phenotype C): 3/16\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Phenotype D): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but let's match this to the options given. Looking back at the choices:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me double-check the calculations. Oh wait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Because the presence of a dominant allele for each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- For a bird to have Pigment Red (C present), it needs at least one C allele.\n- For a bird to have Brown (B present), it needs at least one B allele.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes correspond to the combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are indeed 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option G states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" Wait, but according to our calculation, the checkered phenotype includes both checkered red and checkered brown. So in the options, the labels seem to mix up the terms. Perhaps the options are phrased differently. Option G lists checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, and plain brown as 1. That doesn't align with our numbers. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B present, it's Phenotype A: Pigment Red and Brown. If it has C present and B absent, Phenotype B: Pigment Red and Checkered. If it has C absent and B present, Phenotype C: Plain and Brown. If both C and B are absent, Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered. So the counts are 9, 3, 3, and 1. But none of the options exactly say that. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at option G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Hmm, that doesn't fit because checkered refers to the B trait, while plain refers to the c trait. So perhaps the options are mixing up the terms. Maybe the intended answer uses a different terminology. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me verify once more.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by both traits, so each bird's phenotype is a combination. So the count should be 9:3:3:1. So the options don't directly reflect this unless they're mislabeled. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nNo, that doesn't add up. Option H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nStill doesn't add up. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nThat adds up to 3+9+1+3=16, which fits. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3. Wait, but that's 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not standard. However, the options may not list it that way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic classification.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, but the overall phenotype is determined by the combination. So for each bird, the presence of pigment red requires at least one C allele, and the presence of brown requires at least one B allele. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (both C and B present): 9/16\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C present, B absent): 3/16\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present): 3/16\n4. Plain and Checkered (both C and B absent): 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the options are presented differently, such as grouping the checkered and plain together. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nHmm, that would imply that checkered refers to the presence of both traits, which isn't correct. Because checkered is when both traits are present, but in reality, checkered is when the B trait is present without the B allele (i.e., b), while plain is when the B allele is present (B).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options use a different terminology where \"checkered\" is used to mean the absence of pigment (c) and presence of body color (B), but that's confusing. Maybe the options are using \"checkered\" incorrectly, but I'll proceed under the assumption that the intended answer corresponds to the correct ratio.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Among the options, option G lists the checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, and plain brown as 1. Wait, that would mean checkered red is when both traits are present (which is 9), checkered brown is when B is present and c is absent (which is 3?), but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mistakenly labeled. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the phenotype definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the phenotypes more clearly. The correct phenotypic expression based on the presence of dominant alleles is:\n\n- Pigment Red and Brown: C (dominant) and B (dominant) present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain and Brown: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain and Checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the correct option would be the one that matches this ratio. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nThis seems to group the checkered and plain together, which isn't accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different system, such as using 'red' to refer to the absence of pigment (c) and 'brown' to refer to the presence of body color (B), leading to:\n\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Brown (body) \u2192 Checkered (cB)\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Checkered (bB) \u2192 Plain (cb)\n- Plain (cb) and Brown (Bb) \u2192 Checkered (cb)\n- Plain (cb) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 Checkered (cc)\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. Let me redefine the phenotypes properly:\n\nUsing 'red' as the absence of pigment (c) and 'brown' as presence of body color (B):\n\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Brown (body) \u2192 cB (Checkered)\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Checkered (bB) \u2192 cb (Plain)\n- Plain (cb) and Brown (Bb) \u2192 cB (Checkered)\n- Plain (cb) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 cc (Checkered)\n\nWait, that can't be right because both cB and cb would lead to the same phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick to the original definition where checkered refers to the absence of pigment, i.e., c, and brown is present.\n\nIn that case, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to:\n\n- 9: Pigment Red and Brown\n- 3: Pigment Red and Checkered\n- 3: Plain and Brown\n- 1: Plain and Checkered\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match. Option G is 9:3:3:1, which does match our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option G, despite the labeling ambiguity. So I'll choose option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let me try a different approach. Instead of thinking in terms of the entire bird, let's consider each gene separately and then combine the results.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C present) = 3/4 (since 75% of birds have at least one dominant C allele)\n- P(c present) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- P(B present) = 3/4\n- P(b present) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown (Phenotype A): 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered (Phenotype B): 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown (Phenotype C): 3/16\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Phenotype D): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but let's match this to the options given. Looking back at the choices:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me double-check the calculations. Oh wait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Because the presence of a dominant allele for each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- For a bird to have Pigment Red (C present), it needs at least one C allele.\n- For a bird to have Brown (B present), it needs at least one B allele.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes correspond to the combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are indeed 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option G states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" Wait, but according to our calculation, the checkered phenotype includes both checkered red and checkered brown. So in the options, the labels seem to mix up the terms. Perhaps the options are phrased differently. Option G lists checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, and plain brown as 1. That doesn't align with our numbers. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B present, it's Phenotype A: Pigment Red and Brown. If it has C present and B absent, Phenotype B: Pigment Red and Checkered. If it has C absent and B present, Phenotype C: Plain and Brown. If both C and B are absent, Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered. So the counts are 9, 3, 3, and 1. But none of the options exactly say that. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at option G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Hmm, that doesn't fit because checkered refers to the B trait, while plain refers to the c trait. So perhaps the options are mixing up the terms. Maybe the intended answer uses a different terminology. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me verify once more.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by both traits, so each bird's phenotype is a combination. So the count should be 9:3:3:1. So the options don't directly reflect this unless they're mislabeled. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nNo, that doesn't add up. Option H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nStill doesn't add up. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nThat adds up to 3+9+1+3=16, which fits. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3. Wait, but that's 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not standard. However, the options may not list it that way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic classification.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, but the overall phenotype is determined by the combination. So for each bird, the presence of pigment red requires at least one C allele, and the presence of brown requires at least one B allele. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (both C and B present): 9/16\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C present, B absent): 3/16\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present): 3/16\n4. Plain and Checkered (both C and B absent): 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the options are presented differently, such as grouping the checkered and plain together. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nHmm, that would imply that checkered refers to the presence of both traits, which isn't correct. Because checkered is when both traits are present, but in reality, checkered is when the B trait is present without the B allele (i.e., b), while plain is when the B allele is present (B).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options use a different terminology where \"checkered\" is used to mean the absence of pigment (c) and presence of body color (B), but that's confusing. Maybe the options are using \"checkered\" incorrectly, but I'll proceed under the assumption that the intended answer corresponds to the correct ratio.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Among the options, option G lists the checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, and plain brown as 1. Wait, that would mean checkered red is when both traits are present (which is 9), checkered brown is when B is present and c is absent (which is 3?), but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mistakenly labeled. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the phenotype definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the phenotypes more clearly. The correct phenotypic expression based on the presence of dominant alleles is:\n\n- Pigment Red and Brown: C (dominant) and B (dominant) present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain and Brown: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain and Checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the correct option would be the one that matches this ratio. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nThis seems to group the checkered and plain together, which isn't accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different system, such as using 'red' to refer to the absence of pigment (c) and 'brown' to refer to the presence of body color (B), leading to:\n\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Brown (body) \u2192 Checkered (cB)\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Checkered (bB) \u2192 Plain (cb)\n- Plain (cb) and Brown (Bb) \u2192 Checkered (cb)\n- Plain (cb) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 Checkered (cc)\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. Let me redefine the phenotypes properly:\n\nUsing 'red' as the absence of pigment (c) and 'brown' as presence of body color (B):\n\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Brown (body) \u2192 cB (Checkered)\n- Pigment Red (no pigment) and Checkered (bB) \u2192 cb (Plain)\n- Plain (cb) and Brown (Bb) \u2192 cB (Checkered)\n- Plain (cb) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 cc (Checkered)\n\nWait, that can't be right because both cB and cb would lead to the same phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick to the original definition where checkered refers to the absence of pigment, i.e., c, and brown is present.\n\nIn that case, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to:\n\n- 9: Pigment Red and Brown\n- 3: Pigment Red and Checkered\n- 3: Plain and Brown\n- 1: Plain and Checkered\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match. Option G is 9:3:3:1, which does match our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option G, despite the labeling ambiguity. So I'll choose option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not accounting for the fact that if either C or B is missing, the other may still be present.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not accounting for the fact that if either C or B is missing, the other may still be present. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations:\n\nTotal possible combinations for C and B: 4 (as above). Each has a certain probability.\n\nSo for each bird:\n\nPhenotype | Probability\n--- | ---\nA (Red and Brown) | (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nB (Red and Checkered) | (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nC (Plain and Brown) | (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nD (Plain and Checkered) | (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not accounting for the fact that if either C or B is missing, the other may still be present. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations:\n\nTotal possible combinations for C and B: 4 (as above). Each has a certain probability.\n\nSo for each bird:\n\nPhenotype | Probability\n--- | ---\nA (Red and Brown) | (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nB (Red and Checkered) | (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nC (Plain and Brown) | (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nD (Plain and Checkered) | (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, converting that to phenotypic ratios given the options:\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option H says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that seems off. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option F: 4 each. Option B: 8,4,0,4. Option C: 9,3,3,1. Oh, wait, the total number of birds in F2 is 16 (since 4^2=16). Let's add up the parts in option C: 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

So the correct approach is to calculate the number of phenotypic classes and their probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, a better method is to list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes in the F2 generation, then count the occurrences. Since each gene has three possible states (for each bird?), wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. For example:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n---|---|---\nRed and Brown (A) | Yes | Yes\nRed and Checkered (B) | Yes | No\nPlain and Brown (C) | No | Yes\nPlain and Checkered (D) | No | No\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.

Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1 (because both are always present in the F2 generation). But that's not correct because some birds might have one dominant and one recessive allele in each gene, leading to different phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014phenotype depends on dominant or recessive, not the order. So for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele in each gene, they will have both traits. If they don't, they won't have both. Wait, but each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the possible phenotypes are four as listed above.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each bird has two traits, and the presence of each dominant allele affects the respective trait. So the correct approach is to calculate the number of phenotypic classes and their probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, a better method is to list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes in the F2 generation, then count the occurrences. Since each gene has three possible states (for each bird?), wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. For example:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n---|---|---\nRed and Brown (A) | Yes | Yes\nRed and Checkered (B) | Yes | No\nPlain and Brown (C) | No | Yes\nPlain and Checkered (D) | No | No\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present. Since the traits are independent:\n\n- For A: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 This seems off because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1 (because both are always present in the F2 generation). But that's not correct because some birds might have one dominant and one recessive allele in each gene, leading to different phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014phenotype depends on dominant or recessive, not the order. So for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele in each gene, they will have both traits. If they don't, they won't have both. Wait, but each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the possible phenotypes are four as listed above. Now, to find the probabilities:\n\nFor A (both traits present):\n\n- The probability that C is present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 75% have at least one C)\n- The probability that B is present is also 3/4\n- Since they are independent, P(A) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, for B (only C present):\n\n- P(C present) = 3/4\n- P(B absent) = 1/4\n- P(B) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nFor C (only B present):\n\n- P(B present) = 3/4\n- P(C absent) = 1/4\n- P(C) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nFor D (neither present):\n\n- P(C absent) = 1/4\n- P(B absent) = 1/4\n- P(D) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nThe answer choices are labeled A through J, each with a specific phenotypic ratio. Let's analyze them:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, plain brown 9, checkered brown 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not sure without calculation.\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16.\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also adds to 16, but the numbers seem inconsistent with our calculations.\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16. But according to our calculation, the distribution is 9:3:3:1, not 6:2:6:2.\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Total 16, but the ratios are higher than what we expect.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 16, but the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\nOption D: 2,6,3,9 \u2192 Sum to 20, which is incorrect.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equally distributed, which isn't the case here.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16, but the ratios don't match.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12, which is wrong.\n\nFrom our analysis, option C (Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1) sums to 16 and follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which matches our calculation. Looking back, none of the other options perfectly match 9:3:3:1 except option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. Probability of C present: 3/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since 1/4 of the birds are bb). Thus, 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Class C: C absent, B present. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B present: 3/4. Thus, 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4. Thus, 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Now, convert these fractions to ratios. Total possible outcomes: 16.\n\nSo:\n\nClass A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\nClass B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass D: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts. Now, looking at the options given, none seem to match this directly. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic ratio. Maybe instead of counting classes, we count the number of each phenotype. Let me recount. Wait, no\u2014the classes are mutually exclusive, so the counts add up to 16, representing 100% of the population. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. The options are given as numerical ratios without denominators. Let me look back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 2:6:2:6 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3:9:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nFrom our calculations, the F2 phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's the combined probability. But the phenotypic classes are determined by whether both are present or not, so:\n\nClass A (both present): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nClass B (only C present): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C (only B present): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D (neither present): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding up to 16 parts.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at the options, option G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which matches our calculation.\n\nLet me double-check to ensure I didn't mix anything up. The phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, for the other classes:\n\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nClass D: Both C and B absent \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\nClass A: 9/16\nClass B: 3/16\nClass C: 3/16\nClass D: 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option H says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That seems incorrect because according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match. Option I says 7:5:1:3, also incorrect. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which is reverse of what we have. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the order. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option B is 6:2:2:2, still off. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles is what determines the phenotype. So for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele in C leads to red, and the presence in B leads to brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So the probability of Phenotype A (both C and B present) is 3/4 (for C) * 3/4 (for B) = 9/16. Similarly, Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Phenotype D (both absent): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Adding up these probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 9:3:3:1 seems off.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nC.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, since the presence of C is 3/4 and presence of B is 3/4, the combined probability is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for both traits to be expressed.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent. - Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only 1/4 of the population has bb)\nThus, joint probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nJoint probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present. - Prob C absent: 1/4\n- Prob B absent: 1/4\nJoint: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nClass A: 9/16\nClass B: 3/16\nClass C: 3/16\nClass D: 1/16\n\nTotal: 16/16 = 1, checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 No\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 No\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 No\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 No\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No\n\nTherefore, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not accounting for the fact that the presence of one affects the other.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not accounting for the fact that the presence of one affects the other. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the combined probability is indeed 9/16 for class A. Similarly, for class B: C present, B absent. Probability of C present: 3/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only 25% of the population has bb). Since they are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, class C: C absent, B present. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B present: 3/4. Combined: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4. Combined: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Now, summing up the probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. So now, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Wait, that seems different from our calculation. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check. The F2 phenotypic distribution under independent assortment for two traits (each with two alleles) results in 9:3:3:1 ratio. So according to our calculations, that would mean 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the answer choices match exactly this. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't align.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All equal.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match the 9:3:3:1 ratio directly. Maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the counts instead of percentages. If the total number of F2 individuals is N, then the counts would be 9N/16, 3N/16, etc., but the options don't specify numbers, just the ratios. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the simplified ratio without fractions. Let me see: 9:3:3:1 simplifies to 3:1:1:0.333... but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach bird has two independent traits. The number of possible genotypes for each trait is three (e.g., for pigment color, red is dominant, so possible genotypes are RR, Rr, rr, but since it's determined by a single gene, the presence of R (dominant) determines the trait). Similarly for color. So the number of phenotypic classes is 3 (pigment) x 3 (color) = 9. But due to dominance, some classes may overlap. However, since the genes are independent, the 9:3:3:1 ratio holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, so perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me reconsider the cross. The cross is Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) \u00d7 plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. The F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown (let's call this Phenotype A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Checkered and brown (Phenotype C)\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Checkered and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- For Phenotype A: Both C and B are present.\n  - Probability of C present: 3/4\n  - Probability of B present: 3/4\n  - Independent: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent.\n  - 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present.\n  - 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D: Both absent.\n  - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, checking the answer options, I don't see a direct match. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2013 that's 5+3 vs 2+6=8, which sums to 13, not 16, so probably wrong.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2013 16 parts, but 9:3:3:1 is 16 parts, so 4 each is not the ratio.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,6 \u2192 12+2+2+6=22, which is too high.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 total, but 9:3:3:1 is 16, so nope.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, 16 parts, but 9:3:3:1 is 16 parts, so 3+9+1+3=16.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of individual counts rather than percentages. So, if the total number of F2 individuals is N, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9N/16\n- B: 3N/16\n- C: 3N/16\n- D: N/16\n\nIf N is 16, then counts are 9,3,3,1. But in the answer options, none directly state this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at option E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Counts add to 16, following the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the reverse of our 9:3:3:1. So unless the question refers to the order differently, perhaps I got the phenotypes mixed up.\n\nWait, let me clarify the definitions. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. So if our 9:3:3:1 applies, but the options don't have that exact ratio, perhaps I made a miscalculation elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the probabilities. The probability that both C and B are present is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. The probability that C is present and B is absent is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Similarly for C absent and B present, also 3/16. And both absent is 1/16. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none directly match this except option E, which lists the ratio as 3:9:1:3, but that would imply a different order. Perhaps the question has the order reversed? Or perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, let me look at option E again: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This adds up to 16, but it's phrased as 3:9:1:3, which matches our 9:3:3:1 when inverted. Unless the question considers the order differently, such as starting with checkered red, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, which would correspond to 3:9:1:3. So option E states \"3,9,1,3,\" which is equivalent to 3:9:1:3. But according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. None of the options directly reflect this, but option E provides the same numerical values but in a different order. Perhaps the question expects the order to be based on the presence of certain traits first, so 3 checkered red (which is both C and B present?), but I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of the recessive allele as the phenotype. For example, if checkered is recessive (bb), and red is dominant (BB or Bb), similarly, brown is dominant (Bb or BB), and plain is recessive (bb). But in reality, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the recessive ones. So the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant trait.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match this exactly, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Maybe the question assumes that the checkered phenotype is determined by the recessive allele (bb), and red by dominant (B), brown by dominant (B), and plain by recessive (b). So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would still follow 9:3:3:1, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which lists the ratio as 3:9:1:3, implying that the checkered phenotype comes before the non-checkered ones. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of checkered versus non-checkered, which would be 3 checkered (9) and 7 non-checkered (3+3+1=7), giving a ratio of 9:7. But that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of checkered to non-checkered, which would be 3 checkered (from the dominant traits) to 13 non-checkered (from the recessive traits). But that's 3:13, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is focusing on the presence of the dominant coat color (red and brown) versus the recessive one (checkered). So checkered (checkered) and non-checkered (red and brown). The count would be 3 checkered (from 9) and 7 non-checkered (from 3+3+1=7). So 9:7. Still not an option.\n\nWait, going back to the options, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Summing these, it's 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculations, the checkered phenotypes (both red and brown) should be 9, and non-checkered (red and brown) should be 7. So option H doesn't match. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, which totals 16 but is structured as 3:9:1:3, which matches our 9:3:3:1 if we invert the order. So if the question is expecting the order to be checkered red followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, which is what option E presents, despite the ratio being inverted, then option E is the closest. \n\nTherefore, despite discrepancies, option E seems to be the best fit based on the structure of the counts provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not accounting for the fact that the presence of one affects the other. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the combined probability is indeed 9/16 for class A. Similarly, for class B: C present, B absent. Probability of C present: 3/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only 25% of the population has bb). Since they are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, class C: C absent, B present. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B present: 3/4. Combined: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4. Combined: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Now, summing up the probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. So now, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Wait, that seems different from our calculation. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check. The F2 phenotypic distribution under independent assortment for two traits (each with two alleles) results in 9:3:3:1 ratio. So according to our calculations, that would mean 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the answer choices match exactly this. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't align.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All equal.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match the 9:3:3:1 ratio directly. Maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the counts instead of percentages. If the total number of F2 individuals is N, then the counts would be 9N/16, 3N/16, etc., but the options don't specify numbers, just the ratios. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the simplified ratio without fractions. Let me see: 9:3:3:1 simplifies to 3:1:1:0.333... but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach bird has two independent traits. The number of possible genotypes for each trait is three (e.g., for pigment color, red is dominant, so possible genotypes are RR, Rr, rr, but since it's determined by a single gene, the presence of R (dominant) determines the trait). Similarly for color. So the number of phenotypic classes is 3 (pigment) x 3 (color) = 9. But due to dominance, some classes may overlap. However, since the genes are independent, the 9:3:3:1 ratio holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, so perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me reconsider the cross. The cross is Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) \u00d7 plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. The F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown (let's call this Phenotype A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Checkered and brown (Phenotype C)\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Checkered and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- For Phenotype A: Both C and B are present.\n  - Probability of C present: 3/4\n  - Probability of B present: 3/4\n  - Independent: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent.\n  - 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present.\n  - 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D: Both absent.\n  - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, checking the answer options, I don't see a direct match. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2013 that's 5+3 vs 2+6=8, which sums to 13, not 16, so probably wrong.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2013 16 parts, but 9:3:3:1 is 16 parts, so 4 each is not the ratio.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,6 \u2192 12+2+2+6=22, which is too high.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 total, but 9:3:3:1 is 16, so nope.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, 16 parts, but 9:3:3:1 is 16 parts, so 3+9+1+3=16.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of individual counts rather than percentages. So, if the total number of F2 individuals is N, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9N/16\n- B: 3N/16\n- C: 3N/16\n- D: N/16\n\nIf N is 16, then counts are 9,3,3,1. But in the answer options, none directly state this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at option E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Counts add to 16, following the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the reverse of our 9:3:3:1. So unless the question refers to the order differently, perhaps I got the phenotypes mixed up.\n\nWait, let me clarify the definitions. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. So if our 9:3:3:1 applies, but the options don't have that exact ratio, perhaps I made a miscalculation elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the probabilities. The probability that both C and B are present is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. The probability that C is present and B is absent is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Similarly for C absent and B present, also 3/16. And both absent is 1/16. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none directly match this except option E, which lists the ratio as 3:9:1:3, but that would imply a different order. Perhaps the question has the order reversed? Or perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, let me look at option E again: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This adds up to 16, but it's phrased as 3:9:1:3, which matches our 9:3:3:1 when inverted. Unless the question considers the order differently, such as starting with checkered red, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, which would correspond to 3:9:1:3. So option E states \"3,9,1,3,\" which is equivalent to 3:9:1:3. But according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. None of the options directly reflect this, but option E provides the same numerical values but in a different order. Perhaps the question expects the order to be based on the presence of certain traits first, so 3 checkered red (which is both C and B present?), but I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of the recessive allele as the phenotype. For example, if checkered is recessive (bb), and red is dominant (BB or Bb), similarly, brown is dominant (Bb or BB), and plain is recessive (bb). But in reality, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the recessive ones. So the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant trait.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match this exactly, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Maybe the question assumes that the checkered phenotype is determined by the recessive allele (bb), and red by dominant (B), brown by dominant (B), and plain by recessive (b). So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would still follow 9:3:3:1, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which lists the ratio as 3:9:1:3, implying that the checkered phenotype comes before the non-checkered ones. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of checkered versus non-checkered, which would be 3 checkered (9) and 7 non-checkered (3+3+1=7), giving a ratio of 9:7. But that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of checkered to non-checkered, which would be 3 checkered (from the dominant traits) to 13 non-checkered (from the recessive traits). But that's 3:13, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is focusing on the presence of the dominant coat color (red and brown) versus the recessive one (checkered). So checkered (checkered) and non-checkered (red and brown). The count would be 3 checkered (from 9) and 7 non-checkered (from 3+3+1=7). So 9:7. Still not an option.\n\nWait, going back to the options, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Summing these, it's 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculations, the checkered phenotypes (both red and brown) should be 9, and non-checkered (red and brown) should be 7. So option H doesn't match. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, which totals 16 but is structured as 3:9:1:3, which matches our 9:3:3:1 if we invert the order. So if the question is expecting the order to be checkered red followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, which is what option E presents, despite the ratio being inverted, then option E is the closest. \n\nTherefore, despite discrepancies, option E seems to be the best fit based on the structure of the counts provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, no\u2014this isn't quite right because the presence of dominant alleles does affect the phenotype.",
    "rollout": " But wait, no\u2014this isn't quite right because the presence of dominant alleles does affect the phenotype. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait expression. So the combined probability of both traits appearing (i.e., both C and B dominant) is indeed (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of only one trait appearing is:\n\n- Only C dominant (and B absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Only B dominant (and C absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\nTotal for Phenotype B: 2/16 = 1/8\n\nAnd Phenotype C: only C absent (2/4) and B present (3/4): (2/4) * (3/4) = 6/16 = 3/8\n\nPhenotype D: neither C nor B dominant: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 9:2:6:1, but that adds up to 18 parts. However, the options given don't include such a ratio. Let me look back at the options. Option G says 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Hmm, that seems close. But according to our calculation, it's 9:2:6:1. None of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without relying on probabilities. Let's try constructing a Punnett square manually. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have all possible combinations of these gametes. Since both genes are independent, we can list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB + cB)\n- CC bb (from CB + cb)\n- cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb + cB)\n- cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC bb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc BB: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 (only from CB + CB)\n- Phenotype B: 1 (from CB + cB)\n- Phenotype C: 1 (from CB + cb)\n- Phenotype D: 4 (from cb + cb, cb + cB, cB + cb, cb + cb?) Wait, no, let's recount:\n\nLooking at the list above, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. cc BB\n5. cc Bb\n6. cc bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to the following phenotypes:\n\n1. A\n2. B\n3. C\n4. D\n5. D\n6. D\n\nSo counts are:\n\n- A: 1\n- B: 1\n- C: 1\n- D: 4\n\nThis totals to 1+1+1+4=7, but earlier we thought it was 16. This discrepancy arises because the original parents were homozygous, leading to all possible F1 being CcBb, which then leads to F2 with 16 possible genotypes. However, when converted to phenotypes, due to dominance, many of these are grouped together. So the correct phenotypic ratio is 1 (A) :1 (B) :1 (C) :4 (D) \u2192 1:1:1:4. But none of the answer choices match this directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 6:2:6:2\n\nC. 9:3:9:3\n\nD. 1:1:3:9\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:2\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nNone of the options perfectly match 1:1:1:4, but option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-examine the question. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Maybe instead of grouping by dominant alleles, I should consider the actual phenotypes based on the combination of both genes. Let me try a different approach: for each bird, determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Then, count the number of each phenotype.\n\nFrom the F2 population, each bird is a combination of the six possible F2 genotypes, each producing a certain phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (only B dominant)\n4. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D (only B dominant)\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (only B dominant)\n6. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (no dominant alleles)\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- A: 1\n- B: 1\n- C: 1\n- D: 4\n\nAdding up to 7. However, since the problem mentions \"expected phenotypic ratio,\" perhaps it expects a ratio among the four phenotypes, ignoring the last few birds that don't fit. But that doesn't seem standard. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the F2 calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents being homozygous is incorrect. The first parent is CC BB, which is technically homozygous, but perhaps it refers to having two copies of each gene, making it homozygous for both. The second parent is cc bb, which is also homozygous. Thus, the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is what we calculated. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the F2 includes all possible genotypes, including those without the recessive alleles, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the correct way is to group the genotypes into phenotypes, regardless of the exact order. From the F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo the counts are A:1, B:1, C:1, D:4. Total of 7. But the options don't have 1:1:1:4. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, no\u2014the other way around. Wait, no\u2014the first sentence says \"red\" is controlled by C (dominant), and \"plain\" is controlled by c (recessive). So perhaps I mixed up the dominance. Let me clarify: C is dominant for pigment color, so dominant C leads to red, and recessive c leads to plain. Similarly, B is dominant for body color, so dominant B leads to brown, recessive b leads to checkered. So the previous analysis holds.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:4. However, looking at the options, none of them match exactly. The closest is option J: 2:6:3:1, which doesn't align. Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2, each bird can be categorized as follows:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Phenotype A (1 bird)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Phenotype B (1 bird)\n- C recessive, B dominant: Phenotype C (1 bird)\n- Neither C nor B dominant: Phenotype D (4 birds)\n\nThat's a total of 7 birds. But why do the options include ratios summing to 16, 18, etc.? Maybe the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 and F2 ratios differently. Let me check the question again. Oh! Wait a minute\u2014maybe I misread the parents. The first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both C and B. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous for both c and b. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing. As previously, the F2 genotypes are 16, but their phenotypes reduce to four categories based on dominance. \n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:4, which isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that some phenotypes may have multiple genotypes contributing to them. For example, a bird that is cc BB (phenotype D) comes from cb \u00d7 cb, whereas a bird that is cc Bb comes from cb \u00d7 cB, etc. But the key point is that the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact genotype.\n\nHowever, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, plain brown 3, red brown 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another possibility is that the initial parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means both alleles are the same, so for the checkered red bird, both alleles are c (for the recessive phenotype) and c (for pigment), making cc, and both are B (but wait, B is for body color. Wait, no\u2014the first part is about pigment color, and the second part is about body color. So the checkered red bird is homozygous for the recessive pigment color (c), and the dominant body color (B)? Wait, no. The problem defines the checkered as being recessive for both traits, while the red is dominant. So perhaps the checkered bird is cc bb, and the red bird is CC BB. Wait, but that would mean that the red bird has both pigment dominant alleles, and the checkered bird has both body recessive. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nWhen crossed, F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfed gives F2, which includes all possible combinations of C and B alleles. Now, the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, the phenotypic ratio would be based on whether each gene is present in a dominant form. \n\nLet me recalculate the F2 phenotypic counts:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\nSo the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the F2 population consists of all possible combinations, which are 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and they're independent). However, when grouped by phenotype, we get:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 (only from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Phenotype B: 1 (from CB \u00d7 cB)\n- Phenotype C: 1 (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- Phenotype D: 4 (from cb \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 cB, cB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nTotal: 7 birds. But since the problem requires a ratio, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the last bird(s) that don't meet a certain criteria, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the F2 calculation. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but one is homozygous for one trait and the other for another. Wait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So checkered red is homozygous for recessive traits (c and c for pigment, B and B for body?), while plain brown is homozygous for recessive traits (c and c for pigment, b and b for body?). Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is recessive for pigment and body, so it's cc bb. The plain brown bird is dominant for pigment (B) and recessive for body (b), so it's BB bb. Wait, that changes things. Because if the checkered bird is cc bb, and the plain brown bird is BB bb, then the F1 would be CcBb (as before), but the F2 would involve the F1 selfing. \n\nAh, now I realize I made a mistake earlier. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: cc bb (checkered red, both traits recessive)\nParent 2: BB bb (plain brown, pigment dominant, body recessive)\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfing would lead to F2, which would be:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for the C locus, possible gametes are CB, cb, cc (probabilities 25%, 50%, 25%). For the B locus, same: CB, cb, bb. Thus, F2 genotypes would be all possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. CB \u00d7 bb \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n5. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n6. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n7. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n8. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each F1 can produce four gametes, resulting in 16 possible F2 genotypes. But since the parents are cc bb and BB bb, the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\nWait, no, actually, each F1 can produce four gametes:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC Bb\n3. CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CC Bb\n4. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC Bb\n5. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc BB\n6. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n7. cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 cc Bb\n8. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Instead, each F1 gamete combines with each other F1 gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CC Bb\n- From CB \u00d7 cB: CC Bb\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CC Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CC Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cB: cc Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 CB, cB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (again, same as above)\n- CC Bb (same)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cB)\n- cc Bb (same as above)\n- cc bb (same as below)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's clearer to list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC Bb\n4. CC Bb\n5. CC Bb\n6. cc bb\n7. cc Bb\n8. cc Bb\n\nSo 8 unique genotypes, each with equal frequency (25% each). Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C dominant)\n3. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (no dominant alleles)\n7. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C (only B dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- A: 1 bird\n- B: 4 birds\n- C: 2 birds\n- D: 1 bird\n\nWait, that makes 8 birds. But the options don't include 8 as a total. Let me check again. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the absolute numbers. So the phenotypes are A, B, C, D with counts 1, 4, 2, 1 respectively. Summing to 8. But the options don't have a ratio that sums to 8 except possibly option H, but that's 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the counts.\n\nWait, each F2 genotype has a 25%",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014this isn't quite right because the presence of dominant alleles does affect the phenotype. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait expression. So the combined probability of both traits appearing (i.e., both C and B dominant) is indeed (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of only one trait appearing is:\n\n- Only C dominant (and B absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Only B dominant (and C absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\nTotal for Phenotype B: 2/16 = 1/8\n\nAnd Phenotype C: only C absent (2/4) and B present (3/4): (2/4) * (3/4) = 6/16 = 3/8\n\nPhenotype D: neither C nor B dominant: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 9:2:6:1, but that adds up to 18 parts. However, the options given don't include such a ratio. Let me look back at the options. Option G says 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Hmm, that seems close. But according to our calculation, it's 9:2:6:1. None of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without relying on probabilities. Let's try constructing a Punnett square manually. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have all possible combinations of these gametes. Since both genes are independent, we can list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB + cB)\n- CC bb (from CB + cb)\n- cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb + cB)\n- cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC bb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc BB: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 (only from CB + CB)\n- Phenotype B: 1 (from CB + cB)\n- Phenotype C: 1 (from CB + cb)\n- Phenotype D: 4 (from cb + cb, cb + cB, cB + cb, cb + cb?) Wait, no, let's recount:\n\nLooking at the list above, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. cc BB\n5. cc Bb\n6. cc bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to the following phenotypes:\n\n1. A\n2. B\n3. C\n4. D\n5. D\n6. D\n\nSo counts are:\n\n- A: 1\n- B: 1\n- C: 1\n- D: 4\n\nThis totals to 1+1+1+4=7, but earlier we thought it was 16. This discrepancy arises because the original parents were homozygous, leading to all possible F1 being CcBb, which then leads to F2 with 16 possible genotypes. However, when converted to phenotypes, due to dominance, many of these are grouped together. So the correct phenotypic ratio is 1 (A) :1 (B) :1 (C) :4 (D) \u2192 1:1:1:4. But none of the answer choices match this directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 6:2:6:2\n\nC. 9:3:9:3\n\nD. 1:1:3:9\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:2\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nNone of the options perfectly match 1:1:1:4, but option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-examine the question. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Maybe instead of grouping by dominant alleles, I should consider the actual phenotypes based on the combination of both genes. Let me try a different approach: for each bird, determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Then, count the number of each phenotype.\n\nFrom the F2 population, each bird is a combination of the six possible F2 genotypes, each producing a certain phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (only B dominant)\n4. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D (only B dominant)\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (only B dominant)\n6. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (no dominant alleles)\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- A: 1\n- B: 1\n- C: 1\n- D: 4\n\nAdding up to 7. However, since the problem mentions \"expected phenotypic ratio,\" perhaps it expects a ratio among the four phenotypes, ignoring the last few birds that don't fit. But that doesn't seem standard. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the F2 calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents being homozygous is incorrect. The first parent is CC BB, which is technically homozygous, but perhaps it refers to having two copies of each gene, making it homozygous for both. The second parent is cc bb, which is also homozygous. Thus, the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is what we calculated. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the F2 includes all possible genotypes, including those without the recessive alleles, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the correct way is to group the genotypes into phenotypes, regardless of the exact order. From the F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo the counts are A:1, B:1, C:1, D:4. Total of 7. But the options don't have 1:1:1:4. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, no\u2014the other way around. Wait, no\u2014the first sentence says \"red\" is controlled by C (dominant), and \"plain\" is controlled by c (recessive). So perhaps I mixed up the dominance. Let me clarify: C is dominant for pigment color, so dominant C leads to red, and recessive c leads to plain. Similarly, B is dominant for body color, so dominant B leads to brown, recessive b leads to checkered. So the previous analysis holds.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:4. However, looking at the options, none of them match exactly. The closest is option J: 2:6:3:1, which doesn't align. Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2, each bird can be categorized as follows:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Phenotype A (1 bird)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Phenotype B (1 bird)\n- C recessive, B dominant: Phenotype C (1 bird)\n- Neither C nor B dominant: Phenotype D (4 birds)\n\nThat's a total of 7 birds. But why do the options include ratios summing to 16, 18, etc.? Maybe the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 and F2 ratios differently. Let me check the question again. Oh! Wait a minute\u2014maybe I misread the parents. The first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both C and B. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous for both c and b. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing. As previously, the F2 genotypes are 16, but their phenotypes reduce to four categories based on dominance. \n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:4, which isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that some phenotypes may have multiple genotypes contributing to them. For example, a bird that is cc BB (phenotype D) comes from cb \u00d7 cb, whereas a bird that is cc Bb comes from cb \u00d7 cB, etc. But the key point is that the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact genotype.\n\nHowever, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, plain brown 3, red brown 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another possibility is that the initial parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means both alleles are the same, so for the checkered red bird, both alleles are c (for the recessive phenotype) and c (for pigment), making cc, and both are B (but wait, B is for body color. Wait, no\u2014the first part is about pigment color, and the second part is about body color. So the checkered red bird is homozygous for the recessive pigment color (c), and the dominant body color (B)? Wait, no. The problem defines the checkered as being recessive for both traits, while the red is dominant. So perhaps the checkered bird is cc bb, and the red bird is CC BB. Wait, but that would mean that the red bird has both pigment dominant alleles, and the checkered bird has both body recessive. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nWhen crossed, F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfed gives F2, which includes all possible combinations of C and B alleles. Now, the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, the phenotypic ratio would be based on whether each gene is present in a dominant form. \n\nLet me recalculate the F2 phenotypic counts:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\nSo the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the F2 population consists of all possible combinations, which are 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and they're independent). However, when grouped by phenotype, we get:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 (only from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Phenotype B: 1 (from CB \u00d7 cB)\n- Phenotype C: 1 (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- Phenotype D: 4 (from cb \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 cB, cB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nTotal: 7 birds. But since the problem requires a ratio, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the last bird(s) that don't meet a certain criteria, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the F2 calculation. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but one is homozygous for one trait and the other for another. Wait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So checkered red is homozygous for recessive traits (c and c for pigment, B and B for body?), while plain brown is homozygous for recessive traits (c and c for pigment, b and b for body?). Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is recessive for pigment and body, so it's cc bb. The plain brown bird is dominant for pigment (B) and recessive for body (b), so it's BB bb. Wait, that changes things. Because if the checkered bird is cc bb, and the plain brown bird is BB bb, then the F1 would be CcBb (as before), but the F2 would involve the F1 selfing. \n\nAh, now I realize I made a mistake earlier. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: cc bb (checkered red, both traits recessive)\nParent 2: BB bb (plain brown, pigment dominant, body recessive)\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 selfing would lead to F2, which would be:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for the C locus, possible gametes are CB, cb, cc (probabilities 25%, 50%, 25%). For the B locus, same: CB, cb, bb. Thus, F2 genotypes would be all possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. CB \u00d7 bb \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n5. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n6. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n7. bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n8. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each F1 can produce four gametes, resulting in 16 possible F2 genotypes. But since the parents are cc bb and BB bb, the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\nWait, no, actually, each F1 can produce four gametes:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC Bb\n3. CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CC Bb\n4. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC Bb\n5. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc BB\n6. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n7. cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 cc Bb\n8. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Instead, each F1 gamete combines with each other F1 gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CC Bb\n- From CB \u00d7 cB: CC Bb\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CC Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CC Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cB: cc Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 CB, cB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (again, same as above)\n- CC Bb (same)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cB)\n- cc Bb (same as above)\n- cc bb (same as below)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's clearer to list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC Bb\n4. CC Bb\n5. CC Bb\n6. cc bb\n7. cc Bb\n8. cc Bb\n\nSo 8 unique genotypes, each with equal frequency (25% each). Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C dominant)\n3. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (no dominant alleles)\n7. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C (only B dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- A: 1 bird\n- B: 4 birds\n- C: 2 birds\n- D: 1 bird\n\nWait, that makes 8 birds. But the options don't include 8 as a total. Let me check again. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the absolute numbers. So the phenotypes are A, B, C, D with counts 1, 4, 2, 1 respectively. Summing to 8. But the options don't have a ratio that sums to 8 except possibly option H, but that's 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the counts.\n\nWait, each F2 genotype has a 25%",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of red and brown is the same as both being present, so Phenotype A: 9/16. Phenotype B: C present, B absent. This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Phenotype C: C absent, B present. This is when C is absent (1/4) and B is present (3/4), so 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Phenotype D: Both C and B absent. This is when both are absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Now, converting these fractions to ratios: Phenotype A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\nPhenotype B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype D: 1/16 \u2192 1 part Total: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but that's not correct because the presence of C and B are not necessarily independent.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but that's not correct because the presence of C and B are not necessarily independent. Actually, the presence of C is linked to the presence of B because the genes are on different chromosomes, but in reality, each bird has two independent alleles for each gene. Wait, no\u2014the genes are on homologous chromosomes, so each bird's alleles for each gene are inherited from each parent separately. Thus, the presence of a dominant allele for C does not affect the presence of a dominant allele for B. So the probability that a bird has both C and B dominant is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability that a bird has only C dominant (and B recessive) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability that a bird has only B dominant (and C recessive) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Finally, the probability that a bird has neither dominant allele (both C and B recessive) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A :3:B :3:C :1:D.

So checkered red is D, checkered brown is B, plain red is A, plain brown is C. Thus, the ratio is 1:D :3:B :9:A :3:C, but the options provide the ratio in terms of the phenotypes in order: D, B, A, C.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not correct because the presence of C and B are not necessarily independent. Actually, the presence of C is linked to the presence of B because the genes are on different chromosomes, but in reality, each bird has two independent alleles for each gene. Wait, no\u2014the genes are on homologous chromosomes, so each bird's alleles for each gene are inherited from each parent separately. Thus, the presence of a dominant allele for C does not affect the presence of a dominant allele for B. So the probability that a bird has both C and B dominant is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability that a bird has only C dominant (and B recessive) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability that a bird has only B dominant (and C recessive) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Finally, the probability that a bird has neither dominant allele (both C and B recessive) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A :3:B :3:C :1:D. But looking at the options provided, none directly match this exact ratio. The closest option seems to be option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Wait, no, our calculation has D:1, B:3, A:9, C:3. So the order is D, B, A, C, each with counts 1, 3, 9, 3 respectively. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:D :3:B :9:A :3:C, but the options list the phenotypes in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So checkered red is D, checkered brown is B, plain red is A, plain brown is C. Thus, the ratio is 1:D :3:B :9:A :3:C, but the options provide the ratio in terms of the phenotypes in order: D, B, A, C.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not correct because the actual calculation involves considering the genotypes. Let me recast it.

Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is approximately 9:3:3:1. However, since the options given don\u2019t include fractions, we'll convert these ratios to whole numbers by scaling up. Multiplying each by 16 gives us counts of 9, 3, 3, 1.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not quite right because the presence of C and B don't necessarily mean the phenotype is expressed in both traits.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not quite right because the presence of C and B don't necessarily mean the phenotype is expressed in both traits. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the presence of C (for pigment) and B (for color) are independent. So the probability of a bird expressing both traits (red and brown) is the probability that C is present AND B is present. Which is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of a bird having pigment red (C present) but not brown (b present) is (3/4) * (1/4)=3/16. Similarly, the probability of having plain (c present) and brown (B present) is (1/4) * (3/4)=3/16. Finally, the probability of plain (c present) and plain (b present) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not quite right because the presence of C and B don't necessarily mean the phenotype is expressed in both traits. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the presence of C (for pigment) and B (for color) are independent. So the probability of a bird expressing both traits (red and brown) is the probability that C is present AND B is present. Which is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of a bird having pigment red (C present) but not brown (b present) is (3/4) * (1/4)=3/16. Similarly, the probability of having plain (c present) and brown (B present) is (1/4) * (3/4)=3/16. Finally, the probability of plain (c present) and plain (b present) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Adding up all these probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16 parts out of 16, which checks out.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, the probability of exactly C present is 1/4 (only Cc), and same for B.",
    "rollout": " Similarly, the probability of exactly C present is 1/4 (only Cc), and same for B. Wait, no\u2014let me think differently. Instead of focusing on the genetic makeup, perhaps it's easier to look at the possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes. The F2 population consists of 16 possible genotypic combinations (4 x 4), but many of these will be phenotypically identical due to the dominance hierarchy. Let me list them:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red, brown)\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red, checkered)\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotypic category there are. Each of the four original parents contributes to the gametes, leading to a 1:1 ratio in the F2 generation. But the number of each genotype depends on the parents' contributions. However, for simplicity, we can assume that each gamete is equally likely, so each F2 genotype has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic distribution is as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: All cases except when both C and B are absent. So the number of A is 12 out of 16.\n- Phenotype B: Cases where C is present but B is absent, or vice versa. So 4 out of 16.\n- Phenotype D: Cases where neither C nor B is present. So 1 out of 16.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of phenotypes is 12:A :4:B :1:D, which simplifies to 12:4:1 for A:B:D. However, looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Let me review the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2 (Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 0, Plain brown 2)\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nHmm, none of these seem to fit the 12:4:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the genotypes for the F2 generation would be based on the dominance hierarchy. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, let's define:\n\n- Pigmented (C) \u2192 red\n- Non-pigmented (c) \u2192 plain\n- Color-brown (B) \u2192 brown\n- Non-color-brown (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Phenotype 1 (C and B): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's not possible because it would imply 100% of the birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that each bird may have one or the other depending on the alleles. So, instead, I should calculate the probability of each combination separately.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible combinations of the two genes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nGene C: C/C (red) or cc (plain)\nGene B: B/B (brown) or bb (checkered)\n\nPossible Combinations and Phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2 (red and checkered)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\n\nEach of these 9 combinations corresponds to a specific phenotype. Now, let's count how often each phenotype occurs. Each of the 9 possible combinations is equally likely in the F2 generation, assuming random assortment. Therefore:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Occurs when either C is present or B is present. How many combinations lead to Phenotype 1?\n\nLooking at the combinations:\n- CC \u00d7 BB: Yes\n- CC \u00d7 Bb: Yes\n- CC \u00d7 bb: Yes\n- Cc \u00d7 BB: Yes\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb: Yes\n- cc \u00d7 BB: Yes\n- cc \u00d7 Bb: Yes\n- cc \u00d7 bb: Yes\n- Cc \u00d7 bb: Yes\n\nWait, that's 9 instances, all leading to Phenotype 1. But that can't be right because it would mean all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some birds might lack one trait if they have the recessive allele for the other. Hmm, I think I'm misunderstanding the calculation. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, the correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to sum the probabilities of each phenotype. For Phenotype 1 (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this includes all cases where C is present and B is present)\n- However, in reality, since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene is calculated as:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 1 - (probability of recessive) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 for each gene.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability that both genes are present (i.e., both are not recessive) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having exactly one dominant allele in each gene is:\n\nFor C: 1/4 (Cc) * (3/4) (B present) + (3/4) (cc) * 0 (B recessive) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nSame for B: 3/16\nTotal for Phenotype B: 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16\n\nAnd Phenotype D (neither dominant):\n\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:6:1, which simplifies to 9 parts Phenotype A, 6 parts Phenotype B, and 1 part Phenotype D.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option G is 12:2:2:0, and H is 5:3:2:6. None matches 9:6:1. Perhaps I'm still missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the parents are not both showing the dominant and recessive traits for each gene. Let me read the problem again: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" \u2013 so CC BB. \"a plain brown bird\" \u2013 cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, what happens? Let's construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So F1 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should build the Punnett square correctly. Each F1 bird can produce gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%). So the Punnett square would have:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n--------|-------|-----\nCB       | CcBB  | Ccbb\ncb       | ccBB  | ccbb\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so when they self, each gamete is CB or cb. So the Punnett square would have:\n\n```\n           | CB    | cb\n----------|-------|-------\nCB         | CcBB  | Ccbb\ncb         | ccBB  | ccbb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 bird produces gametes: CB (25%) and cb (25%). So when creating the Punnett square, each bird contributes one gamete. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBB, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb (all 25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBB, CcBb, CcBb, Ccbb (25% each)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBB, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb (25% each)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB, ccBb, ccBb, ccbb (25%)\n\nCombining all these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb: 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb) + 25% (from cb \u00d7 CB) = 50%\n- CcBb: 50% (same as above)\n- CcBb: 50% (same as above)\n- CcBB: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb: 50% (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb: 50% (same)\n- CcBb: 50% (same)\n- CcBB: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- ccBB: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- ccBb: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- ccbb: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no, this seems off. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird comes from a combination of gametes. The F2 genotypes can be categorized as:\n\n- Homozygous for C: CC (only if both alleles are C)\n- Heterozygous for C: Cc (one C, one c)\n- Homozygous for B: BB (only if both alleles are B)\n- Heterozygous for B: Bb (one B, one b)\n- Homozygous for c: cc (recessive for C and B)\n- Heterozygous for c: cB or bc (recessive for one or both traits)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype:\n\n- CC: Only from CB \u00d7 CB: 25%\n- Cc: From CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB: (25% + 25%) = 50%\n- cc: From cb \u00d7 cb: 25%\n\n- BB: Only from CB \u00d7 CB: 25%\n- Bb: From CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB: (25% + 25%) = 50%\n- bb: From cb \u00d7 cb: 25%\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes based on dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nAdditionally, for the B locus:\n\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, so the phenotypes depend on both genes. So, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 7 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D: Case 10 \u2192 1 case\n\nHowever, in a population of 16 birds, each F2 bird has a 1/16 chance, so:\n\n- Phenotype A: 7/16\n- Phenotype B: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThis results in a phenotypic ratio of 7:2:1, which isn't among the options. This suggests that I might have made a mistake in identifying the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are considered as pairs, such as red-brown vs. plain-checkered, but that complicates things further.\n\nGiven the options, let's revisit the problem. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking back, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of each trait individually, not combined. Let me try recalculating without considering the interactions between the genes.\n\nIf we treat each gene independently, ignoring the interaction between C and B, then:\n\n- For the C locus: 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (red), 1/4 chance of being plain.\n- For the B locus: 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (brown), 1/4 chance of being checkered.\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red-brown, plus (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 for red-checkered, plus (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 for plain-brown, and (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 for plain-checkered. This gives a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G (12:2:2:0)\u2014no, wait, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16. Wait, 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question treats each gene separately without considering their interaction. If so, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (red): 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (checkered): 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (none): 1/16\n\nWhich totals 16. But none of the options provide 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption G is 12:2:2:0. Hmm, that adds up to 16 as well. Perhaps the problem considers that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene overrides the effect of the other. For example, if a bird is red (at least one C), it can be brown or plain depending on the B status. But according to standard dihybrid cross calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem uses a different approach, treating each trait as a binary condition (presence or absence) without considering dominance hierarchies beyond simple counts. For instance, if the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the trait, then the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of combinations where either C or B is present.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAgain, this gives 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\nB. 8,4,0,4\u219216\nC. 9,3,3,1\u219216\nD. 1,3,9,3\u219216\nE. 3,9,1,3\u219216\nF. 4,4,4,4\u219216\nG. 12,2,2,0\u219216\nH. 5,3,2,6\u219216\nI. 7,5,1,3\u219216\n\nOnly option C and G sum to 16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of exactly C present is 1/4 (only Cc), and same for B. Wait, no\u2014let me think differently. Instead of focusing on the genetic makeup, perhaps it's easier to look at the possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes. The F2 population consists of 16 possible genotypic combinations (4 x 4), but many of these will be phenotypically identical due to the dominance hierarchy. Let me list them:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red, brown)\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red, checkered)\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotypic category there are. Each of the four original parents contributes to the gametes, leading to a 1:1 ratio in the F2 generation. But the number of each genotype depends on the parents' contributions. However, for simplicity, we can assume that each gamete is equally likely, so each F2 genotype has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic distribution is as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: All cases except when both C and B are absent. So the number of A is 12 out of 16.\n- Phenotype B: Cases where C is present but B is absent, or vice versa. So 4 out of 16.\n- Phenotype D: Cases where neither C nor B is present. So 1 out of 16.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of phenotypes is 12:A :4:B :1:D, which simplifies to 12:4:1 for A:B:D. However, looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Let me review the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2 (Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 0, Plain brown 2)\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nHmm, none of these seem to fit the 12:4:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the genotypes for the F2 generation would be based on the dominance hierarchy. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, let's define:\n\n- Pigmented (C) \u2192 red\n- Non-pigmented (c) \u2192 plain\n- Color-brown (B) \u2192 brown\n- Non-color-brown (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Phenotype 1 (C and B): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's not possible because it would imply 100% of the birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that each bird may have one or the other depending on the alleles. So, instead, I should calculate the probability of each combination separately.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible combinations of the two genes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nGene C: C/C (red) or cc (plain)\nGene B: B/B (brown) or bb (checkered)\n\nPossible Combinations and Phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2 (red and checkered)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\n\nEach of these 9 combinations corresponds to a specific phenotype. Now, let's count how often each phenotype occurs. Each of the 9 possible combinations is equally likely in the F2 generation, assuming random assortment. Therefore:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Occurs when either C is present or B is present. How many combinations lead to Phenotype 1?\n\nLooking at the combinations:\n- CC \u00d7 BB: Yes\n- CC \u00d7 Bb: Yes\n- CC \u00d7 bb: Yes\n- Cc \u00d7 BB: Yes\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb: Yes\n- cc \u00d7 BB: Yes\n- cc \u00d7 Bb: Yes\n- cc \u00d7 bb: Yes\n- Cc \u00d7 bb: Yes\n\nWait, that's 9 instances, all leading to Phenotype 1. But that can't be right because it would mean all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some birds might lack one trait if they have the recessive allele for the other. Hmm, I think I'm misunderstanding the calculation. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, the correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to sum the probabilities of each phenotype. For Phenotype 1 (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this includes all cases where C is present and B is present)\n- However, in reality, since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene is calculated as:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 1 - (probability of recessive) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 for each gene.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability that both genes are present (i.e., both are not recessive) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having exactly one dominant allele in each gene is:\n\nFor C: 1/4 (Cc) * (3/4) (B present) + (3/4) (cc) * 0 (B recessive) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nSame for B: 3/16\nTotal for Phenotype B: 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16\n\nAnd Phenotype D (neither dominant):\n\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:6:1, which simplifies to 9 parts Phenotype A, 6 parts Phenotype B, and 1 part Phenotype D.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option G is 12:2:2:0, and H is 5:3:2:6. None matches 9:6:1. Perhaps I'm still missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the parents are not both showing the dominant and recessive traits for each gene. Let me read the problem again: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" \u2013 so CC BB. \"a plain brown bird\" \u2013 cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, what happens? Let's construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So F1 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should build the Punnett square correctly. Each F1 bird can produce gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%). So the Punnett square would have:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n--------|-------|-----\nCB       | CcBB  | Ccbb\ncb       | ccBB  | ccbb\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so when they self, each gamete is CB or cb. So the Punnett square would have:\n\n```\n           | CB    | cb\n----------|-------|-------\nCB         | CcBB  | Ccbb\ncb         | ccBB  | ccbb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 bird produces gametes: CB (25%) and cb (25%). So when creating the Punnett square, each bird contributes one gamete. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBB, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb (all 25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBB, CcBb, CcBb, Ccbb (25% each)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBB, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb (25% each)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB, ccBb, ccBb, ccbb (25%)\n\nCombining all these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb: 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb) + 25% (from cb \u00d7 CB) = 50%\n- CcBb: 50% (same as above)\n- CcBb: 50% (same as above)\n- CcBB: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb: 50% (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb: 50% (same)\n- CcBb: 50% (same)\n- CcBB: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- ccBB: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- ccBb: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- ccbb: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no, this seems off. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird comes from a combination of gametes. The F2 genotypes can be categorized as:\n\n- Homozygous for C: CC (only if both alleles are C)\n- Heterozygous for C: Cc (one C, one c)\n- Homozygous for B: BB (only if both alleles are B)\n- Heterozygous for B: Bb (one B, one b)\n- Homozygous for c: cc (recessive for C and B)\n- Heterozygous for c: cB or bc (recessive for one or both traits)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype:\n\n- CC: Only from CB \u00d7 CB: 25%\n- Cc: From CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB: (25% + 25%) = 50%\n- cc: From cb \u00d7 cb: 25%\n\n- BB: Only from CB \u00d7 CB: 25%\n- Bb: From CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB: (25% + 25%) = 50%\n- bb: From cb \u00d7 cb: 25%\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes based on dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nAdditionally, for the B locus:\n\n- BB \u2192 brown\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, so the phenotypes depend on both genes. So, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 7 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D: Case 10 \u2192 1 case\n\nHowever, in a population of 16 birds, each F2 bird has a 1/16 chance, so:\n\n- Phenotype A: 7/16\n- Phenotype B: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThis results in a phenotypic ratio of 7:2:1, which isn't among the options. This suggests that I might have made a mistake in identifying the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are considered as pairs, such as red-brown vs. plain-checkered, but that complicates things further.\n\nGiven the options, let's revisit the problem. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking back, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of each trait individually, not combined. Let me try recalculating without considering the interactions between the genes.\n\nIf we treat each gene independently, ignoring the interaction between C and B, then:\n\n- For the C locus: 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (red), 1/4 chance of being plain.\n- For the B locus: 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (brown), 1/4 chance of being checkered.\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for red-brown, plus (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 for red-checkered, plus (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 for plain-brown, and (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 for plain-checkered. This gives a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G (12:2:2:0)\u2014no, wait, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16. Wait, 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question treats each gene separately without considering their interaction. If so, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (red): 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (checkered): 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (none): 1/16\n\nWhich totals 16. But none of the options provide 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption G is 12:2:2:0. Hmm, that adds up to 16 as well. Perhaps the problem considers that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene overrides the effect of the other. For example, if a bird is red (at least one C), it can be brown or plain depending on the B status. But according to standard dihybrid cross calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem uses a different approach, treating each trait as a binary condition (presence or absence) without considering dominance hierarchies beyond simple counts. For instance, if the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the trait, then the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of combinations where either C or B is present.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAgain, this gives 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\nB. 8,4,0,4\u219216\nC. 9,3,3,1\u219216\nD. 1,3,9,3\u219216\nE. 3,9,1,3\u219216\nF. 4,4,4,4\u219216\nG. 12,2,2,0\u219216\nH. 5,3,2,6\u219216\nI. 7,5,1,3\u219216\n\nOnly option C and G sum to 16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So Phenotype A: 9/16",
    "rollout": " So Phenotype A: 9/16\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since B is present in 3/4 of cases)\nSo combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nPhenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio of phenotypes is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are labeled from A to H, each with different ratios. Let's go through them:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16, but the ratio seems off.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16, but what's happening here?\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nWait, option G sums to 18, which is wrong. Option H also sums to 16, but the numbers don't align. Looking back at our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly match this. But option F is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. That can't be right unless all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was asking about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. Let me re-examine the question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". Hmm, usually, the ratio refers to the phenotypic distribution. But sometimes, people refer to the count per phenotype. However, the usual phrasing is to provide the ratio of phenotypes, not counts. \n\nLooking back, the user may have misinterpreted the options. Perhaps option F is intended to represent the count per phenotype, but in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, among the options, option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which is incorrect. Option H is 5,3,2,6, sum 16, but the numbers don't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is similar to H. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which adds to 16 but shows zero for checkered, which contradicts our calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: Both C and B absent \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, except perhaps option F, which is 4:4:4:4, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the options were presented differently, and I missed something.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of the F2. Let me check the user's question again. They specified F2 generation. So the correct answer based on our calculations is 9:3:3:1. But since that's not an option, perhaps I need to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total. The total is 16, so each phenotype's count is 9,3,3,1 respectively. But none of the options reflect that. Wait, option F is 4,4,4,4, which would imply 4 each, totaling 16, but that's incorrect because the distribution isn't equal. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the principles. Let me verify.\n\nAnother approach: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n        | C    | c\n      -----------------\n      CB     | CC  | Cc\n      cb     | Cc  | cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes from these genotypes:\n\n- CC: C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n- Cc: C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (recessive) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- cc: C (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- cc: C (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (recessive) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe frequency of each phenotype is proportional to the frequency of each genotype, assuming independent assortment. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 50%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 0% (since cc cannot have B)\n\nThus, the ratio is 25:50:25:0, which simplifies to 1:2:1:0. Converting to whole numbers relative to the total (sum 4):\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 part\n- Phenotype B: 2 parts\n- Phenotype C: 1 part\n- Phenotype D: 0 parts\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options provided. It looks like none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, except option F, which is 4:4:4:4. This discrepancy suggests that either I made a mistake, or the options are presented incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation instead of the F2, but I don't think so because the user clearly stated F2.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest matching option is option F, but it's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Another possibility is that I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Wait, the user said that C is dominant for pigment and B is dominant for color. So in terms of phenotype expression, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene results in that trait being expressed. Therefore, a bird with C and B will be red and brown, while a bird with c and B will be plain and brown, and so on.\n\nIf I accept that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, then among the options, none directly match, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to say F1 instead of F2. If that's the case, then the F1 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red and brown (C and B present): 25%\n- Red and checkered (C present, B absent): 25%\n- Plain and brown (C absent, B present): 25%\n- Plain and checkered (both absent): 25%\n\nWhich is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, so option F. But the question specifies F2, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. For instance, if the F2 population consists of 16 birds, how many of each phenotype do we expect?\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\nPhenotype A: 9 \u2192 9\nPhenotype B: 3 \u2192 3\nPhenotype C: 3 \u2192 3\nPhenotype D: 1 \u2192 1\n\nSo the count is 9:3:3:1, which matches our previous ratio. Again, none of the options directly match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option F, but it's incorrect based on the calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 ratio instead of F2. If that's the case, then the F1 would have a 25:25 split between the two phenotypes: red-brown and plain-checkered. So the ratio would be 1:1, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1. But that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, after recalculating and considering all possibilities, the correct phenotypic ratio according to the given genetic makeup is 9:3:3:1. However, since this isn't one of the options, and considering the most plausible interpretation leading to option F (4:4:4:4), which assumes equal distribution, despite being incorrect, I might lean towards option F. But strictly speaking, based on the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option F, but I'm unsure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. So Phenotype A: 9/16\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since B is present in 3/4 of cases)\nSo combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nPhenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio of phenotypes is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are labeled from A to H, each with different ratios. Let's go through them:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16, but the ratio seems off.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16, but what's happening here?\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nWait, option G sums to 18, which is wrong. Option H also sums to 16, but the numbers don't align. Looking back at our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly match this. But option F is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. That can't be right unless all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was asking about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. Let me re-examine the question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". Hmm, usually, the ratio refers to the phenotypic distribution. But sometimes, people refer to the count per phenotype. However, the usual phrasing is to provide the ratio of phenotypes, not counts. \n\nLooking back, the user may have misinterpreted the options. Perhaps option F is intended to represent the count per phenotype, but in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, among the options, option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which is incorrect. Option H is 5,3,2,6, sum 16, but the numbers don't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is similar to H. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which adds to 16 but shows zero for checkered, which contradicts our calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: Both C and B absent \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, except perhaps option F, which is 4:4:4:4, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the options were presented differently, and I missed something.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of the F2. Let me check the user's question again. They specified F2 generation. So the correct answer based on our calculations is 9:3:3:1. But since that's not an option, perhaps I need to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total. The total is 16, so each phenotype's count is 9,3,3,1 respectively. But none of the options reflect that. Wait, option F is 4,4,4,4, which would imply 4 each, totaling 16, but that's incorrect because the distribution isn't equal. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the principles. Let me verify.\n\nAnother approach: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n        | C    | c\n      -----------------\n      CB     | CC  | Cc\n      cb     | Cc  | cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes from these genotypes:\n\n- CC: C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n- Cc: C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (recessive) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- cc: C (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- cc: C (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (recessive) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe frequency of each phenotype is proportional to the frequency of each genotype, assuming independent assortment. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 50%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 0% (since cc cannot have B)\n\nThus, the ratio is 25:50:25:0, which simplifies to 1:2:1:0. Converting to whole numbers relative to the total (sum 4):\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 part\n- Phenotype B: 2 parts\n- Phenotype C: 1 part\n- Phenotype D: 0 parts\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options provided. It looks like none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, except option F, which is 4:4:4:4. This discrepancy suggests that either I made a mistake, or the options are presented incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation instead of the F2, but I don't think so because the user clearly stated F2.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest matching option is option F, but it's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Another possibility is that I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Wait, the user said that C is dominant for pigment and B is dominant for color. So in terms of phenotype expression, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene results in that trait being expressed. Therefore, a bird with C and B will be red and brown, while a bird with c and B will be plain and brown, and so on.\n\nIf I accept that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, then among the options, none directly match, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to say F1 instead of F2. If that's the case, then the F1 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red and brown (C and B present): 25%\n- Red and checkered (C present, B absent): 25%\n- Plain and brown (C absent, B present): 25%\n- Plain and checkered (both absent): 25%\n\nWhich is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, so option F. But the question specifies F2, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. For instance, if the F2 population consists of 16 birds, how many of each phenotype do we expect?\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\nPhenotype A: 9 \u2192 9\nPhenotype B: 3 \u2192 3\nPhenotype C: 3 \u2192 3\nPhenotype D: 1 \u2192 1\n\nSo the count is 9:3:3:1, which matches our previous ratio. Again, none of the options directly match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option F, but it's incorrect based on the calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 ratio instead of F2. If that's the case, then the F1 would have a 25:25 split between the two phenotypes: red-brown and plain-checkered. So the ratio would be 1:1, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1. But that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, after recalculating and considering all possibilities, the correct phenotypic ratio according to the given genetic makeup is 9:3:3:1. However, since this isn't one of the options, and considering the most plausible interpretation leading to option F (4:4:4:4), which assumes equal distribution, despite being incorrect, I might lean towards option F. But strictly speaking, based on the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option F, but I'm unsure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, in reality, each bird's phenotype depends on both traits. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations and count the number of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (phenotype AB)\n- Red and Checkered (AB')\n- Plain and Brown (AB'')\n- Plain and Checkered (AB''')\n\nWhere:\n- A = C present\n- B = B present\n- A' = C absent\n- B' = B absent\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Red and Brown (A and B):\n   - Probability A = 3/4 (since 75% of the population will have at least one C allele)\n   - Probability B = 3/4\n   - Assuming independence: P(A and B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Red and Checkered (A and B'):\n   - P(A) = 3/4\n   - P(B') = 1/4\n   - P(A and B') = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and Brown (A' and B):\n   - P(A') = 1/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - P(A' and B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and Checkered (A' and B'):\n   - P(A') = 1/4\n   - P(B') = 1/4\n   - P(A' and B') = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo now, converting these fractions to counts based on the total number of F2 individuals (assuming 16 birds):\n\n- Phenotype AB: 9 birds\n- Phenotype AB': 3 birds\n- Phenotype A'B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype A'B': 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, grouped as 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nOption C matches our calculation: Phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): The probability that a bird has at least one C allele and at least one B allele.\n\nThe probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc).

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the probabilities. Let's go through each possibility again.\n\nEach bird has two independent traits, determined by two genes. For each trait, the presence of the dominant allele results in the expressed trait.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because in reality, the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the bird has a certain trait. Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele in a gene leads to the expression of that trait. So, for example, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will have brown color. Therefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): The probability that a bird has at least one C allele and at least one B allele.\n\nThe probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc). Similarly, the probability of having at least one B allele is 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nFor Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): Probability of having at least one C allele AND no B allele. Probability of at least one C is 3/4, probability of no B (i.e., bb) is 1/4. Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): At least one B AND no C. Probability of at least one B is 3/4, probability of no C (cc) is 1/4. Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Neither C nor B present. Probability of no C (cc) is 1/4, probability of no B (bb) is 1/4. Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 \u2192 Simplifying, multiply all by 16: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThis corresponds to Phenotype 1 (9 parts), Phenotype 2 (3), Phenotype 3 (3), Phenotype 4 (1).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption J says: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Red and Brown = 9\n- Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered = 3\n- Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown = 3\n- Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered = 1\n\nBut none of the options directly match this except option G, which states a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which seems different. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the probabilities. Let's go through each possibility again.\n\nEach bird has two independent traits, determined by two genes. For each trait, the presence of the dominant allele results in the expressed trait. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Both traits expressed: 9/16\n- Only first trait expressed: 3/16\n- Only second trait expressed: 3/16\n- Neither trait expressed: 1/16\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to the number of each phenotype. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no\u2014this is not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together, not independently.",
    "rollout": " Wait, no\u2014this is not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together, not independently. Instead, the correct approach is to look at the possible combinations. Let me instead list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when both C and B are dominant.\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Occurs when C is dominant, B is recessive.\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Occurs when C is recessive, B is dominant.\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Occurs when both C and B are recessive.\n\nTo find the probabilities, we can calculate the number of favorable combinations over the total possible. Each parent produces four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible F2 genotypes. However, phenotypically, certain genotypes lead to the same phenotype. For example, the genotype CcBb can result in both traits being expressed, while ccbB results in only one trait. But since we're interested in phenotypes, not genotypes, we need to map each genotype to its phenotype. Alternatively, we can calculate the probabilities directly by considering the segregation of each gene independently.\n\nThe probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one dominant allele for C). Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both C and B being present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of both C and B absent is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. These correspond to Phenotypes A, B, C, and D respectively. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but let me double-check this calculation because sometimes when dealing with dominance, the calculations can differ slightly. Another approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible gametes. Each parent produces four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, and cb. Wait, no\u2014they produce CB and cb in equal proportions. So in F1 (CcBb), each parent produces two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (both C and B dominant)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D (both recessive)\n\nSo the F2 will have four types of birds:\n\n- 25% CcBb (Phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (Phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (Phenotype A)\n- 25% ccbb (Phenotype D)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each F2 bird is determined by the combination of the gametes from each parent. Since each parent contributes two gametes, the F2 will have a total of 16 possible combinations, but many will result in the same phenotype. Let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): From each parent contributing CB, there are 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB) plus 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb) plus 25% (from cb \u00d7 CB) \u2192 Total of 75% of the F2 population. Wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes CB or cb equally, then:\n\nEach parent can produce CB or cb, each at 50% chance. So the F2 will have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, Phenotype A occurs in 75% of the F2, and Phenotype D occurs in 25%.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts our earlier calculation. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I realize now. Each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, but phenotypically, some combinations result in the same phenotype. Specifically, the combinations where both C and B are dominant (i.e., CcBb) result in Phenotype A, whereas the combinations where C is recessive (cc) and/or B is recessive (bb) do not.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Using the Punnett square method for dihybrid crosses:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the Phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% (CC\u00d7CC) + 25% (CC\u00d7Cc) + 25% (Cc\u00d7CC) \u2192 Total 75%\n- Phenotype D: 25% (CC\u00d7cc) + 25% (Cc\u00d7cc) + 25% (cc\u00d7CC) + 25% (cc\u00d7cc) \u2192 Total 25%\n\nWait, but this seems off because each F2 bird is determined by both genes, and the phenotypes are combinations of both. So the correct approach is to group the F2 genotypes by their phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: CcBb \u2192 occurs when at least one dominant allele is present in each gene. This happens in 75% of the F2.\n- Phenotype B: Ccbb \u2192 occurs when C is present and B is recessive \u2192 25% of F2.\n- Phenotype C: ccBb \u2192 occurs when c is present and B is present \u2192 25% of F2.\n- Phenotype D: ccbb \u2192 occurs when both c and b are present \u2192 25% of F2.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. Let me clarify:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both dominant), any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will express both traits. So Phenotype A includes:\n\n- CcBb (phenotype A)\n- Ccbb (phenotype B)\n- ccBb (phenotype C)\n- ccbb (phenotype D)\n\nBecause in ccBb, C is recessive but B is dominant, so Phenotype C. In ccbb, both are recessive, so Phenotype D.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution among the F2 population is:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 75% (all except Phenotypes B, C, D)\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 25% (only when C is dominant and B is recessive)\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 25% (only when c is recessive and B is dominant)\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 25% (only when both c and B are recessive)\n\nThis makes the phenotypic ratio 3:1:1:1, but wait, that adds up to 6 parts. However, looking back, each of the four phenotypes (A, B, C, D) corresponds to different counts based on the Punnett square:\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\nFrom the previous breakdown, Phenotype A occurs in 75% of F2 (because 75% of the F2 population is CcBb), Phenotype B occurs in 25% (Ccbb), Phenotype C occurs in 25% (ccBb), and Phenotype D occurs in 25% (ccbb).\n\nWait, but according to the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, but that applies to a situation where each trait is influenced independently, which may not apply here. However, in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic ratio is 75% A : 25% B : 25% C : 25% D, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options seem to match exactly. Let me review the options provided.\n\nThe options are labeled A through J, each providing a different ratio. Option E states a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds. If we assume that all F2 individuals are accounted for, the ratio would be based on their phenotypes. According to my earlier analysis, Phenotype A is 75%, which would be 12 out of 16, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only certain phenotypes exist. Wait, going back to the problem statement: \"show the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the user provided an incorrect assumption about the F2 generation. Because according to my calculations, the correct ratio would involve multiple phenotypes with varying frequencies. But the options given don't include 75:25:25:25, nor do they suggest such a ratio. Looking back, option E says 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, and that matches the total number of birds. Wait, no\u2014the sum of option E is 3+9+1+3=16, which fits with the 16 birds in the F2 generation. But what's the phenotypic ratio in E? It says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 3+9+1+3=16, which fits. But according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1:1:1, but the options don't align. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a dihybrid cross. Then, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 would depend on the dominance of each trait. As previously analyzed, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. However, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals to 16 birds, matching the F2 generation. But according to my analysis, the correct ratio should be 3:1:1:1, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore certain phenotypes. Maybe the question is only considering the presence of one dominant allele, thereby reducing the phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dihybrid cross. Let me try a different approach using the Punnett square for the dihybrid cross between CC BB (which is not applicable, as it's homozygous for both traits) and cc bb. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because the parent would have to be able to produce gametes, but CC BB cannot produce any gametes because both alleles are dominant. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be as previously discussed. But perhaps the initial understanding of the question was incorrect, and it's not a dihybrid cross but a simple cross between CC BB and cc bb, but that wouldn't be a typical dihybrid cross because the parents are homozygous for both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits. But in this case, the parents are homozygous, which complicates things.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based solely on the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other. For example, if a bird is C_B_, it's red and brown; if it's c_b_, it's plain and checkered. The phenotypes would then be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, resulting in four phenotypes: red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, plain and checkered. The ratios would be based on the likelihood of each trait being expressed, considering the genetic makeup.\n\nIn that case, the probability of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present \u2192 3/4 (for C) * 3/4 (for B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): c present, B absent \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Both c and B absent \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 1/16\n- Phenotype 4: 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+1+3=16 \u2192 16/16=1, correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:1:3, which is option G. But option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that adds to 16. Hmm, but according to this, checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches option G. But earlier, I thought the correct ratio was 3:1:1:1, but that doesn't align with the options. However, perhaps the user intended a dihybrid cross without considering both genes simultaneously, treating each separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of each gene, leading to four phenotypes, each with a different ratio. But according to this approach, the ratio would be 9:3:1:3, which is option G. However, looking back at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. Option G is 9:3:1:3, which is correct if checking the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the correct answer would be option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, the correct ratio should be 3:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the phenotypes, or perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the dihybrid cross without considering the dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would match option E. But that doesn't account for dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross with both genes independently assorting and both being codominant would be 9:3:3:1, but in this case, the birds are codominant, so each trait is expressed fully. However, since both traits are expressed, the phenotypic ratio becomes 16, divided into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that doesn't match any of the options. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again. The F2 generation will have the following possibilities:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Only when both C and B are present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Only when C is present and B is absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Only when C is absent and B is present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Only when both C and B are absent \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided don't include this exact ratio. The closest option is option E, which lists 3:9:1:3, but that reverses the numbers. Option G is 9:3:1:3, which also reverses the third pair. Option H is 3:9:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me read the options again. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, but it's 3+9+1+3=16. That would imply that the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is option E. But according to my calculations, it should be 9:3:3:1. Therefore, perhaps the user incorrectly assigned the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014this is not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits together, not independently. Instead, the correct approach is to look at the possible combinations. Let me instead list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when both C and B are dominant.\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Occurs when C is dominant, B is recessive.\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Occurs when C is recessive, B is dominant.\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Occurs when both C and B are recessive.\n\nTo find the probabilities, we can calculate the number of favorable combinations over the total possible. Each parent produces four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible F2 genotypes. However, phenotypically, certain genotypes lead to the same phenotype. For example, the genotype CcBb can result in both traits being expressed, while ccbB results in only one trait. But since we're interested in phenotypes, not genotypes, we need to map each genotype to its phenotype. Alternatively, we can calculate the probabilities directly by considering the segregation of each gene independently.\n\nThe probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one dominant allele for C). Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both C and B being present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of both C and B absent is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. These correspond to Phenotypes A, B, C, and D respectively. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but let me double-check this calculation because sometimes when dealing with dominance, the calculations can differ slightly. Another approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible gametes. Each parent produces four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, and cb. Wait, no\u2014they produce CB and cb in equal proportions. So in F1 (CcBb), each parent produces two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (both C and B dominant)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D (both recessive)\n\nSo the F2 will have four types of birds:\n\n- 25% CcBb (Phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (Phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (Phenotype A)\n- 25% ccbb (Phenotype D)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each F2 bird is determined by the combination of the gametes from each parent. Since each parent contributes two gametes, the F2 will have a total of 16 possible combinations, but many will result in the same phenotype. Let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): From each parent contributing CB, there are 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB) plus 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb) plus 25% (from cb \u00d7 CB) \u2192 Total of 75% of the F2 population. Wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes CB or cb equally, then:\n\nEach parent can produce CB or cb, each at 50% chance. So the F2 will have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, Phenotype A occurs in 75% of the F2, and Phenotype D occurs in 25%.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts our earlier calculation. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I realize now. Each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, but phenotypically, some combinations result in the same phenotype. Specifically, the combinations where both C and B are dominant (i.e., CcBb) result in Phenotype A, whereas the combinations where C is recessive (cc) and/or B is recessive (bb) do not.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Using the Punnett square method for dihybrid crosses:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the Phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% (CC\u00d7CC) + 25% (CC\u00d7Cc) + 25% (Cc\u00d7CC) \u2192 Total 75%\n- Phenotype D: 25% (CC\u00d7cc) + 25% (Cc\u00d7cc) + 25% (cc\u00d7CC) + 25% (cc\u00d7cc) \u2192 Total 25%\n\nWait, but this seems off because each F2 bird is determined by both genes, and the phenotypes are combinations of both. So the correct approach is to group the F2 genotypes by their phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: CcBb \u2192 occurs when at least one dominant allele is present in each gene. This happens in 75% of the F2.\n- Phenotype B: Ccbb \u2192 occurs when C is present and B is recessive \u2192 25% of F2.\n- Phenotype C: ccBb \u2192 occurs when c is present and B is present \u2192 25% of F2.\n- Phenotype D: ccbb \u2192 occurs when both c and b are present \u2192 25% of F2.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. Let me clarify:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both dominant), any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will express both traits. So Phenotype A includes:\n\n- CcBb (phenotype A)\n- Ccbb (phenotype B)\n- ccBb (phenotype C)\n- ccbb (phenotype D)\n\nBecause in ccBb, C is recessive but B is dominant, so Phenotype C. In ccbb, both are recessive, so Phenotype D.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution among the F2 population is:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 75% (all except Phenotypes B, C, D)\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 25% (only when C is dominant and B is recessive)\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 25% (only when c is recessive and B is dominant)\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 25% (only when both c and B are recessive)\n\nThis makes the phenotypic ratio 3:1:1:1, but wait, that adds up to 6 parts. However, looking back, each of the four phenotypes (A, B, C, D) corresponds to different counts based on the Punnett square:\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\nFrom the previous breakdown, Phenotype A occurs in 75% of F2 (because 75% of the F2 population is CcBb), Phenotype B occurs in 25% (Ccbb), Phenotype C occurs in 25% (ccBb), and Phenotype D occurs in 25% (ccbb).\n\nWait, but according to the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, but that applies to a situation where each trait is influenced independently, which may not apply here. However, in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic ratio is 75% A : 25% B : 25% C : 25% D, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options seem to match exactly. Let me review the options provided.\n\nThe options are labeled A through J, each providing a different ratio. Option E states a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds. If we assume that all F2 individuals are accounted for, the ratio would be based on their phenotypes. According to my earlier analysis, Phenotype A is 75%, which would be 12 out of 16, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only certain phenotypes exist. Wait, going back to the problem statement: \"show the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the user provided an incorrect assumption about the F2 generation. Because according to my calculations, the correct ratio would involve multiple phenotypes with varying frequencies. But the options given don't include 75:25:25:25, nor do they suggest such a ratio. Looking back, option E says 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, and that matches the total number of birds. Wait, no\u2014the sum of option E is 3+9+1+3=16, which fits with the 16 birds in the F2 generation. But what's the phenotypic ratio in E? It says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 3+9+1+3=16, which fits. But according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1:1:1, but the options don't align. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a dihybrid cross. Then, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 would depend on the dominance of each trait. As previously analyzed, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. However, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals to 16 birds, matching the F2 generation. But according to my analysis, the correct ratio should be 3:1:1:1, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore certain phenotypes. Maybe the question is only considering the presence of one dominant allele, thereby reducing the phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dihybrid cross. Let me try a different approach using the Punnett square for the dihybrid cross between CC BB (which is not applicable, as it's homozygous for both traits) and cc bb. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because the parent would have to be able to produce gametes, but CC BB cannot produce any gametes because both alleles are dominant. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be as previously discussed. But perhaps the initial understanding of the question was incorrect, and it's not a dihybrid cross but a simple cross between CC BB and cc bb, but that wouldn't be a typical dihybrid cross because the parents are homozygous for both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits. But in this case, the parents are homozygous, which complicates things.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based solely on the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other. For example, if a bird is C_B_, it's red and brown; if it's c_b_, it's plain and checkered. The phenotypes would then be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, resulting in four phenotypes: red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, plain and checkered. The ratios would be based on the likelihood of each trait being expressed, considering the genetic makeup.\n\nIn that case, the probability of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present \u2192 3/4 (for C) * 3/4 (for B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): c present, B absent \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Both c and B absent \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 1/16\n- Phenotype 4: 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+1+3=16 \u2192 16/16=1, correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:1:3, which is option G. But option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that adds to 16. Hmm, but according to this, checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches option G. But earlier, I thought the correct ratio was 3:1:1:1, but that doesn't align with the options. However, perhaps the user intended a dihybrid cross without considering both genes simultaneously, treating each separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of each gene, leading to four phenotypes, each with a different ratio. But according to this approach, the ratio would be 9:3:1:3, which is option G. However, looking back at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. Option G is 9:3:1:3, which is correct if checking the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the correct answer would be option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, the correct ratio should be 3:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the phenotypes, or perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the dihybrid cross without considering the dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would match option E. But that doesn't account for dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross with both genes independently assorting and both being codominant would be 9:3:3:1, but in this case, the birds are codominant, so each trait is expressed fully. However, since both traits are expressed, the phenotypic ratio becomes 16, divided into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that doesn't match any of the options. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again. The F2 generation will have the following possibilities:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Only when both C and B are present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Only when C is present and B is absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Only when C is absent and B is present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Only when both C and B are absent \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided don't include this exact ratio. The closest option is option E, which lists 3:9:1:3, but that reverses the numbers. Option G is 9:3:1:3, which also reverses the third pair. Option H is 3:9:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me read the options again. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, but it's 3+9+1+3=16. That would imply that the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is option E. But according to my calculations, it should be 9:3:3:1. Therefore, perhaps the user incorrectly assigned the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

    "rollout": " But wait, this approach might not account for the actual phenotypic expression correctly because the phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the frequency of the alleles. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and count the number of phenotypic classes.\n\nEach bird can have four possible genotypic combinations for the two genes:\n\n1. C/C (C is dominant) and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A (since B is still present as dominant)\n3. C/c and B/B \u2192 Phenotype B\n4.

C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nSo, counting the number of Phenotypes A, B, C, D:\n\nPhenotype A: 2 cases (1 and 4)\nPhenotype B: 2 cases (3 and 4)\nWait no\u2014let me recount. From the above, Phenotype A occurs when either both C and B are present, i.e., in cases 1, 2, 3, and 4? Wait no\u2014case 1: C/C and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 2: C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 3: C/c and B/B \u2192 Phenotype B\nCase 4: C/c and B/b \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nWait, no. Cases 1 and 4 lead to Phenotype A, while cases 2 and 3 lead to Phenotype B. So Phenotype A: 2 cases\nPhenotype B: 2 cases\nPhenotype C: Occurs when C is missing (cc) and B is present (B/B or B/b) \u2192 2 cases\nPhenotype D: Occurs when C is present (C/C or C/c) and B is missing (bb) \u2192 2 cases\n\nTherefore, each phenotypic class (A, B, C, D) has 2 cases out of 4 possible, giving a phenotypic ratio of 2:2:2:2, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. Wait, that can\u2019t be right because that would imply equal distribution among the four phenotypes, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to different phenotypes. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (only B dominant, C recessive)\n4. Plain and checkered (neither C nor B dominant)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (A):\n\n- Probability of C being present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B being present: 3/4\n- Since these are independent, P(A) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nFor Phenotype 2 (B):\n\n- Must have C present (3/4) and B absent (1/4)\n- P(B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Phenotype 3 (C):\n\n- Must have B present (3/4) and C absent (1/4)\n- P(C) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Phenotype 4 (D):\n\n- Must have neither C nor B dominant (all recessive alleles)\n- P(D) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought it was 1:1:1:1, but now it's 9:3:3:1. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me re-examine the calculation. The correct approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The number of phenotypic classes is 2^2 = 4, but some classes may overlap. However, in reality, each bird will have exactly one phenotype because each bird can have at most one dominant allele for each gene. Wait, no\u2014actually, each bird can have multiple dominant alleles, but the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of their number. So, for example, a bird with two C alleles (C/C) and one B allele (B/b) would display red pigment and brown color. Another bird with two c alleles and two b alleles would display plain and checkered. So the four phenotypic classes are indeed distinct.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nThe probability of having both C and B alleles (for Phenotype A) is:\n\n- Number of ways to get at least one C and at least one B: For each gene, there are three possibilities (C/C, Cc, cc) and similarly for B. So the total number of combinations is 3 * 3 = 9. The favorable ones are those where both C and B are present, which are 2 * 2 = 4 (since C can be C/C or Cc, and B can be B/B or Bb, but wait, B is represented as B/B or Bb or bb. Hmm, this approach might be complicating things. Instead, let's consider that each bird can have four possible genotype combinations for the two genes:\n\n1. C/C and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. C/c and B/B \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. C/c and B/b \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nThus, each bird falls into one of these four categories, each occurring with certain probabilities. Calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A occurs when C/C (prob 3/4) and B/B or B/b (prob 3/4) \u2192 P(A) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B occurs when C/c (prob 1/4) and B/B or B/b (prob 3/4) \u2192 P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C occurs when C/C (prob 3/4) and B/b (prob 1/4) \u2192 P(C) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D occurs when C/c (prob 1/4) and B/b (prob 1/4) \u2192 P(D) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which matches our calculation. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which doesn't fit. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which also doesn't fit. Option K says \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\", which is different. Option L says \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which is also incorrect. Option M says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which doesn't match. Option N says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which is close but not exact. Option O says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which is similar to G but inverted. Option P says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\", which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which we don't have. Option Q says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\", same as P. Option R says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which doesn't align. Option S says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". This matches option S. \n\nLooking at our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. However, none of the options directly state this. Option S states \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". Wait, let me recalculate to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's try another approach. The Punnett square for F2 would be constructed as follows:\n\n          | C | c\n        ----|---|---\n      C    | CC | Cc\n        ---|---|---\n      C    | CC | Cc\n      c     | Cc | cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, for each genotype, we can determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. For each F2 bird:\n\n- CC (C/c): Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc (C/c): Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B recessive) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc (B/b): Plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nNow, the probabilities of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (CC): 25% (from CC \u00d7 CC)\n- Phenotype B (Cc \u00d7 Cc): 25% (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- Phenotype C (cc \u00d7 cc): 25% (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- Phenotype D (cc \u00d7 Cc): 25% (from cc \u00d7 Cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each F2 bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype. So:\n\n- For genotype CC: Phenotype A\n- For genotype Cc: Phenotype B\n- For genotype cc: Phenotype C\n\nEach of these genotypes occurs with the following probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype A (25% CC): 25%\n- Phenotype B (50% Cc): 50%\n- Phenotype C (25% cc): 25%\n\nWhich adds up to 100%, so the ratio is 1:2:1. Wait, that contradicts what I had before. Earlier, I thought it was 9:3:3:1, but now it seems to be 1:2:1. This discrepancy needs clarification.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between the genes. The problem states that the checkered phenotype is determined by recessive alleles, and plain is dominant. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: C present (dominant)\n- Brown: B present (dominant)\n- Checkered: C absent (recessive) AND B absent (recessive)\n- Plain: C absent AND B present OR C present AND B absent? Wait, no. The checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive. So, checkered occurs when c is present for both genes. Plain occurs when at least one allele is dominant for either gene.\n\nSo, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C present and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain and brown: C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Checkered: c and c \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (C present, B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (C absent, B absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 =16 parts \u2192 ratio 9:3:3:1\n\nBut according to the options, option G is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which fits this ratio. However, none of the options directly say this. Looking at the options, option G is exactly this. But let me check the answer choices again.\n\nYes, option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" So this matches our calculation. However, the options do include option E, which says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" That's the inverse ratio, which would correspond to 1:3:3:1 instead of 9:3:3:1. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check. The problem states that the checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive (c for both genes). So, the checkered phenotype is when both c alleles are present. The plain phenotype is when at least one allele is dominant in either gene. Therefore, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C present and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain and brown: C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Checkered: c and c \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option G. But none of the options have this exact phrasing. Wait, looking back, option G is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that's exactly our ratio. However, I notice that option E is the reverse, which would mean 3:9:3:1, which doesn't match our calculation. So the correct ratio is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, this approach might not account for the actual phenotypic expression correctly because the phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the frequency of the alleles. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and count the number of phenotypic classes.\n\nEach bird can have four possible genotypic combinations for the two genes:\n\n1. C/C (C is dominant) and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A (since B is still present as dominant)\n3. C/c and B/B \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. C/c and B/b \u2192 Phenotype B (since B is present)\n\nSimilarly, for the C gene:\n\n1. cc and B/B \u2192 Phenotype D\n2. cc and B/b \u2192 Phenotype D\n3. C/C and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nSo, counting the number of Phenotypes A, B, C, D:\n\nPhenotype A: 2 cases (1 and 4)\nPhenotype B: 2 cases (3 and 4)\nWait no\u2014let me recount. From the above, Phenotype A occurs when either both C and B are present, i.e., in cases 1, 2, 3, and 4? Wait no\u2014case 1: C/C and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 2: C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 3: C/c and B/B \u2192 Phenotype B\nCase 4: C/c and B/b \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nWait, no. Cases 1 and 4 lead to Phenotype A, while cases 2 and 3 lead to Phenotype B. So Phenotype A: 2 cases\nPhenotype B: 2 cases\nPhenotype C: Occurs when C is missing (cc) and B is present (B/B or B/b) \u2192 2 cases\nPhenotype D: Occurs when C is present (C/C or C/c) and B is missing (bb) \u2192 2 cases\n\nTherefore, each phenotypic class (A, B, C, D) has 2 cases out of 4 possible, giving a phenotypic ratio of 2:2:2:2, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. Wait, that can\u2019t be right because that would imply equal distribution among the four phenotypes, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to different phenotypes. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (only B dominant, C recessive)\n4. Plain and checkered (neither C nor B dominant)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (A):\n\n- Probability of C being present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B being present: 3/4\n- Since these are independent, P(A) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nFor Phenotype 2 (B):\n\n- Must have C present (3/4) and B absent (1/4)\n- P(B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Phenotype 3 (C):\n\n- Must have B present (3/4) and C absent (1/4)\n- P(C) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Phenotype 4 (D):\n\n- Must have neither C nor B dominant (all recessive alleles)\n- P(D) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought it was 1:1:1:1, but now it's 9:3:3:1. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me re-examine the calculation. The correct approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The number of phenotypic classes is 2^2 = 4, but some classes may overlap. However, in reality, each bird will have exactly one phenotype because each bird can have at most one dominant allele for each gene. Wait, no\u2014actually, each bird can have multiple dominant alleles, but the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of their number. So, for example, a bird with two C alleles (C/C) and one B allele (B/b) would display red pigment and brown color. Another bird with two c alleles and two b alleles would display plain and checkered. So the four phenotypic classes are indeed distinct.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nThe probability of having both C and B alleles (for Phenotype A) is:\n\n- Number of ways to get at least one C and at least one B: For each gene, there are three possibilities (C/C, Cc, cc) and similarly for B. So the total number of combinations is 3 * 3 = 9. The favorable ones are those where both C and B are present, which are 2 * 2 = 4 (since C can be C/C or Cc, and B can be B/B or Bb, but wait, B is represented as B/B or Bb or bb. Hmm, this approach might be complicating things. Instead, let's consider that each bird can have four possible genotype combinations for the two genes:\n\n1. C/C and B/B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C/C and B/b \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. C/c and B/B \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. C/c and B/b \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nThus, each bird falls into one of these four categories, each occurring with certain probabilities. Calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A occurs when C/C (prob 3/4) and B/B or B/b (prob 3/4) \u2192 P(A) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B occurs when C/c (prob 1/4) and B/B or B/b (prob 3/4) \u2192 P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C occurs when C/C (prob 3/4) and B/b (prob 1/4) \u2192 P(C) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D occurs when C/c (prob 1/4) and B/b (prob 1/4) \u2192 P(D) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which matches our calculation. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which doesn't fit. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which also doesn't fit. Option K says \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\", which is different. Option L says \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which is also incorrect. Option M says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which doesn't match. Option N says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which is close but not exact. Option O says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which is similar to G but inverted. Option P says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\", which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which we don't have. Option Q says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\", same as P. Option R says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which doesn't align. Option S says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". This matches option S. \n\nLooking at our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. However, none of the options directly state this. Option S states \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". Wait, let me recalculate to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's try another approach. The Punnett square for F2 would be constructed as follows:\n\n          | C | c\n        ----|---|---\n      C    | CC | Cc\n        ---|---|---\n      C    | CC | Cc\n      c     | Cc | cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, for each genotype, we can determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. For each F2 bird:\n\n- CC (C/c): Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc (C/c): Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B recessive) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc (B/b): Plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nNow, the probabilities of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (CC): 25% (from CC \u00d7 CC)\n- Phenotype B (Cc \u00d7 Cc): 25% (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- Phenotype C (cc \u00d7 cc): 25% (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- Phenotype D (cc \u00d7 Cc): 25% (from cc \u00d7 Cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each F2 bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype. So:\n\n- For genotype CC: Phenotype A\n- For genotype Cc: Phenotype B\n- For genotype cc: Phenotype C\n\nEach of these genotypes occurs with the following probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Phenotype A (25% CC): 25%\n- Phenotype B (50% Cc): 50%\n- Phenotype C (25% cc): 25%\n\nWhich adds up to 100%, so the ratio is 1:2:1. Wait, that contradicts what I had before. Earlier, I thought it was 9:3:3:1, but now it seems to be 1:2:1. This discrepancy needs clarification.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between the genes. The problem states that the checkered phenotype is determined by recessive alleles, and plain is dominant. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: C present (dominant)\n- Brown: B present (dominant)\n- Checkered: C absent (recessive) AND B absent (recessive)\n- Plain: C absent AND B present OR C present AND B absent? Wait, no. The checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive. So, checkered occurs when c is present for both genes. Plain occurs when at least one allele is dominant for either gene.\n\nSo, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C present and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain and brown: C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Checkered: c and c \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (C present, B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (C absent, B absent): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 =16 parts \u2192 ratio 9:3:3:1\n\nBut according to the options, option G is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which fits this ratio. However, none of the options directly say this. Looking at the options, option G is exactly this. But let me check the answer choices again.\n\nYes, option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" So this matches our calculation. However, the options do include option E, which says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" That's the inverse ratio, which would correspond to 1:3:3:1 instead of 9:3:3:1. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check. The problem states that the checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive (c for both genes). So, the checkered phenotype is when both c alleles are present. The plain phenotype is when at least one allele is dominant in either gene. Therefore, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C present and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain and brown: C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Checkered: c and c \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option G. But none of the options have this exact phrasing. Wait, looking back, option G is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that's exactly our ratio. However, I notice that option E is the reverse, which would mean 3:9:3:1, which doesn't match our calculation. So the correct ratio is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.",
    "rollout": " Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of both being absent is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of phenotypic classes:\n\nPhenotype A (both dominant): 9/16\nPhenotype B (C dominant, B absent): 3/16\nPhenotype C (C absent, B dominant): 3/16\nPhenotype D (both absent): 1/16\n\nNow, to get the actual counts, we need to know how many F2 individuals there are. Assuming a large population, the ratio remains the same. The sum of the fractions is 16/16=1.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Wait, but looking at the options provided, none seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions given are various ratios, such as 6,2, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should count the number of each phenotype directly without relying solely on probabilities. Let's list all possible F2 individuals and categorize them.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of four possible genotypes for each gene, leading to 16 possible F2 birds. Each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB (Red and Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red and Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain and Brown)\n4. CC bb (Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then the F2 would include CC, Cc, and cc for each gene. Wait, perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nEach of these outcomes has a probability of 25%, except for those with identical gametes. So the F2 includes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's assign phenotypes to each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pigmented red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigmented red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, we need to count how many of each phenotype exist in the F2 generation. Since each F2 individual is produced by a unique combination of gametes, and each gamete is equally likely, the distribution of phenotypes is proportional to the number of each genotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- 1 (for CC BB)\n- 2 (for Cc Bb)\n- 1 (for cc bb)\n\nTotal of 4 birds.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of both being absent is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of phenotypic classes:\n\nPhenotype A (both dominant): 9/16\nPhenotype B (C dominant, B absent): 3/16\nPhenotype C (C absent, B dominant): 3/16\nPhenotype D (both absent): 1/16\n\nNow, to get the actual counts, we need to know how many F2 individuals there are. Assuming a large population, the ratio remains the same. The sum of the fractions is 16/16=1.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Wait, but looking at the options provided, none seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions given are various ratios, such as 6,2, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should count the number of each phenotype directly without relying solely on probabilities. Let's list all possible F2 individuals and categorize them.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of four possible genotypes for each gene, leading to 16 possible F2 birds. Each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB (Red and Brown)\n2. CC Bb (Red and Checkered)\n3. CC bb (Plain and Brown)\n4. CC bb (Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then the F2 would include CC, Cc, and cc for each gene. Wait, perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in a 1:1 ratio. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nEach of these outcomes has a probability of 25%, except for those with identical gametes. So the F2 includes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's assign phenotypes to each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pigmented red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigmented red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, we need to count how many of each phenotype exist in the F2 generation. Since each F2 individual is produced by a unique combination of gametes, and each gamete is equally likely, the distribution of phenotypes is proportional to the number of each genotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- 1 (for CC BB)\n- 2 (for Cc Bb)\n- 1 (for cc bb)\n\nTotal of 4 birds. Wait, that seems off because each parent produces 4 gametes, so the F2 should have 16 birds (4x4), but I think I missed the fact that each gamete pair combines to form a bird. Let me correct that:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the F2 generation will have 16 birds (4\u00d74). Each bird's genotype comes from pairing two gametes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n4.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, and vice versa, and the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.",
    "rollout": " Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, and vice versa, and the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but let me double-check that. Each bird has two independent traits. So the probability of having both traits (C and B) is indeed 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. The probability of having only C (no B) is (number of birds with C but without B) / total. Since B is present in 3/4 cases, without B is 1/4. So (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, without C is 1/4, so (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And without either is 1/16. Now, translating this into the number of birds: Total F2 population is 16 birds (assuming 4x4 grid). So:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B): 9 birds (9/16 of 16)\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent): 3 birds (3/16)\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present): 3 birds (3/16)\nPhenotype D (neither): 1 bird (1/16)\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, and vice versa, and the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but let me double-check that. Each bird has two independent traits. So the probability of having both traits (C and B) is indeed 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. The probability of having only C (no B) is (number of birds with C but without B) / total. Since B is present in 3/4 cases, without B is 1/4. So (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, without C is 1/4, so (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And without either is 1/16. Now, translating this into the number of birds: Total F2 population is 16 birds (assuming 4x4 grid). So:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B): 9 birds (9/16 of 16)\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent): 3 birds (3/16)\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present): 3 birds (3/16)\nPhenotype D (neither): 1 bird (1/16)\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this calculation.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

    "rollout": " But wait, that's not considering dominance. Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele leads to the expression of that trait. So the probability of a bird expressing both traits is 1, because if C is present, it's red, and if B is present, it's brown. But that can't be right because not every bird will have both traits. Wait, actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So the correct way is to consider the possible combinations:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present (red), then B can be present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n- If C is absent (plain), then B can be present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (Class A)\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Class B)\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Class C)\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered (Class D)\n\nNow, the probability of each class:\n\n- Class A: Probability of C present AND B present = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Class B: Probability of C present AND B absent = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Class C: Probability of C absent AND B present = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Class D: Probability of C absent AND B absent = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, summing up to 16 parts.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, option H says the ratio is 5,3,2,1\u2014which doesn't match our calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not considering dominance. Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele leads to the expression of that trait. So the probability of a bird expressing both traits is 1, because if C is present, it's red, and if B is present, it's brown. But that can't be right because not every bird will have both traits. Wait, actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So the correct way is to consider the possible combinations:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present (red), then B can be present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n- If C is absent (plain), then B can be present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (Class A)\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Class B)\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Class C)\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered (Class D)\n\nNow, the probability of each class:\n\n- Class A: Probability of C present AND B present = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Class B: Probability of C present AND B absent = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Class C: Probability of C absent AND B present = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Class D: Probability of C absent AND B absent = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, summing up to 16 parts.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, option H says the ratio is 5,3,2,1\u2014which doesn't match our calculation. Option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems different. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, and the presence of a dominant allele leads to the respective trait.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no\u2014that's not exactly right.",
    "rollout": " Wait, no\u2014that's not exactly right. Because each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present.

Similarly, for Phenotype B (C present, B absent): prob C * prob B'. Prob B' is 1/4 (since 25% have B absent). So 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Phenotype C (C absent, B present): same as Phenotype B, 3/16. Phenotype D (both C and B absent): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts, so probabilities sum to 1. Now, converting these fractions to ratios: Phenotype A: 9/16, B: 3/16, C: 3/16, D:1/16. The ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Phenotype D (both C and B absent): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts, so probabilities sum to 1.

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, no\u2014actually, the presence of C and B are determined by the alleles, so the actual number of birds with both traits is (number of birds with C) times (number of birds with B) divided by the total number of birds.",

But since each bird's traits are determined by both genes, the phenotypic classes can be calculated differently. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for each bird, the chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is:\n\nFor C: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\nSimilarly for B: 3/4\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of both traits being present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is also 3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- A (both present): 9/16\n- B (C present, B absent): 3/16\n- C (C absent, B present): 3/16\n- D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, actually, the presence of a dominant allele does not directly translate to the probability of the phenotype.",
    "rollout": " But wait, actually, the presence of a dominant allele does not directly translate to the probability of the phenotype. Instead, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So each bird has a 3/4 chance of having the dominant allele for each trait, leading to a 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 chance of both traits being present, resulting in Phenotype A.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype B: C present, B absent. - Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Joint probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present. - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Joint probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Both C and B absent. - Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nTotal = 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1\n\nSo,\n\nPhenotype A: 9 parts\nPhenotype B: 3 parts\nPhenotype C: 3 parts\nPhenotype D: 1 part\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratio, we can simplify the counts. Adding Phenotype A (9), B (3), C (3), D (1), the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. However, option G says 12:2:2:0, which seems different. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but the calculation assumes independence. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes. Let me try constructing a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. Each parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, no\u2014parents can produce CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will combine to produce F2 individuals. Now, let's look at the possible F2 phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: red\n- Cc: pigeon\n- cc: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 pigeon and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 pigeon and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 pigeon and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 cases (1, 2, 3) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype B: Cases 3, 7, 8 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Cases 4, 5 \u2192 2/16\n- Phenotype D: Cases 6, 9 \u2192 2/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:3:2:2. But none of the options match this exactly. Option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which doesn't align. Option J is 2:6:3:1, also not matching. Option H is 5:3:2:6, still off. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 3+3+2+2=10 parts out of 16. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong about the dominance. Let me reconsider the dominance rules: the father's bird is CC BB, and the mother is cc bb. So, F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Same for B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Now, the possible F2 phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype A: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype B: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 6.25%\nPhenotype C: Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype D: Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% * 4 = 25%, which makes sense because 100% / 4 = 25% per phenotype. But according to this, Phenotype A is 6.25%, B is 6.25%, C is 6.25%, D is 6.25%. But none of the options reflect this exact distribution. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This sum to 5+3+2+6=16, which matches the 16 possible cases. So perhaps the answer is H.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering both genes independently assorting. The F2 will have 16 possible genotypic combinations, but phenotypically, they group into four classes. From earlier calculations, Phenotype A is 3/16, B is 3/16, C is 2/16, D is 2/16. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:2:2, but this isn't among the options. However, Option H states 5:3:2:6, which adds to 16. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Let me verify the parents again. The problem states: \"the checkered red bird\" is CC BB, and \"the plain brown bird\" is cc bb. So when they mate, the F1 should be CcBb, which is correct. Then, F1 selfing produces F2. Each gene segregates independently. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, considering phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 red and brown (phenotype A)\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 red and brown (phenotype A)\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype B)\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 pigeon and brown (phenotype C)\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 pigeon and brown (phenotype C)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 pigeon and checkered (phenotype D)\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype B)\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype B)\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nCounting:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 cases (1, 2, 3) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype B: Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Cases 4,5 \u2192 2/16\n- Phenotype D: Cases 6,9 \u2192 2/16\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:2:2. None of the options match exactly, but Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that some phenotypes may not occur due to the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014if both dominant alleles are present, the phenotype is expressed. So perhaps the correct ratio is 3:3:2:2, but this isn't listed. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16.\n\nIf I assume that the correct ratio is 12:2:2:0 (Option G), which would mean 12 cases of one phenotype and others zero. But according to my previous calculation, Phenotype A is 3/16, which translates to 3:3:2:2. So perhaps the correct answer is Option H because it's the closest to 16, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents was incorrect. If the parents were CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would indeed be CcBb, and the rest follows. \n\nGiven the options, and considering that none perfectly match my calculations, perhaps the intended answer is Option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Because 5+3+2+6=16, and it reflects the possibility that certain phenotypes don't occur. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 3:3:2:2, which isn't an option, so the best approximation is Option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, actually, the presence of a dominant allele does not directly translate to the probability of the phenotype. Instead, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So each bird has a 3/4 chance of having the dominant allele for each trait, leading to a 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 chance of both traits being present, resulting in Phenotype A.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype B: C present, B absent. - Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Joint probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present. - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Joint probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Both C and B absent. - Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nTotal = 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1\n\nSo,\n\nPhenotype A: 9 parts\nPhenotype B: 3 parts\nPhenotype C: 3 parts\nPhenotype D: 1 part\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratio, we can simplify the counts. Adding Phenotype A (9), B (3), C (3), D (1), the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. However, option G says 12:2:2:0, which seems different. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but the calculation assumes independence. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes. Let me try constructing a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. Each parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, no\u2014parents can produce CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will combine to produce F2 individuals. Now, let's look at the possible F2 phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: red\n- Cc: pigeon\n- cc: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 pigeon and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 pigeon and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 pigeon and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 cases (1, 2, 3) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype B: Cases 3, 7, 8 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Cases 4, 5 \u2192 2/16\n- Phenotype D: Cases 6, 9 \u2192 2/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:3:2:2. But none of the options match this exactly. Option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which doesn't align. Option J is 2:6:3:1, also not matching. Option H is 5:3:2:6, still off. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 3+3+2+2=10 parts out of 16. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong about the dominance. Let me reconsider the dominance rules: the father's bird is CC BB, and the mother is cc bb. So, F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Same for B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Now, the possible F2 phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype A: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype B: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 6.25%\nPhenotype C: Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype D: Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% * 4 = 25%, which makes sense because 100% / 4 = 25% per phenotype. But according to this, Phenotype A is 6.25%, B is 6.25%, C is 6.25%, D is 6.25%. But none of the options reflect this exact distribution. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This sum to 5+3+2+6=16, which matches the 16 possible cases. So perhaps the answer is H.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering both genes independently assorting. The F2 will have 16 possible genotypic combinations, but phenotypically, they group into four classes. From earlier calculations, Phenotype A is 3/16, B is 3/16, C is 2/16, D is 2/16. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:2:2, but this isn't among the options. However, Option H states 5:3:2:6, which adds to 16. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Let me verify the parents again. The problem states: \"the checkered red bird\" is CC BB, and \"the plain brown bird\" is cc bb. So when they mate, the F1 should be CcBb, which is correct. Then, F1 selfing produces F2. Each gene segregates independently. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, considering phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 red and brown (phenotype A)\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 red and brown (phenotype A)\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype B)\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 pigeon and brown (phenotype C)\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 pigeon and brown (phenotype C)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 pigeon and checkered (phenotype D)\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype B)\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype B)\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nCounting:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 cases (1, 2, 3) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype B: Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Cases 4,5 \u2192 2/16\n- Phenotype D: Cases 6,9 \u2192 2/16\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:2:2. None of the options match exactly, but Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that some phenotypes may not occur due to the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014if both dominant alleles are present, the phenotype is expressed. So perhaps the correct ratio is 3:3:2:2, but this isn't listed. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16.\n\nIf I assume that the correct ratio is 12:2:2:0 (Option G), which would mean 12 cases of one phenotype and others zero. But according to my previous calculation, Phenotype A is 3/16, which translates to 3:3:2:2. So perhaps the correct answer is Option H because it's the closest to 16, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents was incorrect. If the parents were CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would indeed be CcBb, and the rest follows. \n\nGiven the options, and considering that none perfectly match my calculations, perhaps the intended answer is Option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Because 5+3+2+6=16, and it reflects the possibility that certain phenotypes don't occur. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 3:3:2:2, which isn't an option, so the best approximation is Option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, that seems off. Because if a bird has at least one C allele (i.e., 3/4), and similarly at least one B allele (3/4), then the probability of both is indeed (3/4)^2 = 9/16. Similarly, for the other classes:\n\nClass B: C present (3/4), B absent (1/4) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nClass C: C absent (1/4), B present (3/4) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nClass D: Neither C nor B present (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, option C says 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Let me confirm the options again. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which would imply more than three phenotypes, which isn't the case here. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that can\u2019t be right because if both genes are required to express both traits, then all birds would have both traits, which contradicts our earlier understanding. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, the correct way is to realize that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- A bird with at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- A bird with at least one C and no B \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- A bird with no C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- A bird with neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nFor Phenotype A: Both C and B are present. \n- Probability of C being present: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Probability of B being present: 3/4\nSince C and B are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only 25% have bb)\nSo combined: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but adding up all these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. That makes sense. So the expected phenotypic distribution in the F2 would be approximately 9:3:3:1. But wait, none of the options match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to the probabilities we've calculated. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But this counts the cases where both C and B are present.",
    "rollout": " But this counts the cases where both C and B are present. However, in our phenotypic classification, any bird with at least one C and at least one B will have Phenotype A. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, then it's Phenotype A. If it has C but not B, it's Phenotype B. If it has B but not C, it's Phenotype C. If neither, Phenotype D.\n\nSo, the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither present): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios: \n\n- Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options given, option G states the ratio as checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that seems different. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation without considering the exact dominance, but I don't think so. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation when considering the actual number of each phenotype, not just the ratio. Wait, looking at the options, none directly match 9:3:3:1 except option G, which says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 generation is CcBb. They self, so the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From each parent: CB and cb. So the F2 will have four combinations:\n\n  1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n  2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n  3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n  4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these four combinations occurs with equal probability (25% each). So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype B: Only from CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C: Only from cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D: Only from cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 75:25:25:25, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1 when divided by 25. But this still doesn't align with the given options. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation considering the F1 itself. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine the original question.\n\nThe original question says: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Wait, but the options provided (A-G) list various ratios, including 6:2:2:0, etc. Perhaps I've miscalculated. Let me try another approach. Considering each gene separately:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nSince these genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and brown (B): This requires cc and B. So the probability is (25% cc) * (50% B) = 12.5% (or 1/8)\n2. Checkered (c) and plain (B): (25% cc) * (50% B) = 12.5% \n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): (25% cc) * (50% B) = 12.5%\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% (or 1/16)\n\nAdding these up: 12.5 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 43.75%, which doesn't add up to 100%, indicating an error in calculation. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises because each bird has two traits, and the correct approach is to consider combinations. Instead, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation, combining both genes.\n\nLet me create a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nGenotypes for the C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nGenotypes for the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, I'll enumerate all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nHowever, this might take too long. An alternative approach is to note that for each gene, the probabilities are 25%, 50%, 25%. Combining these for both genes, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options seem to match this exactly. Wait, looking at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense. Option H is 5:3:2:9, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 parts, but the overall sum should be 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me recalculate the F1 phenotypic ratio. F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nThe F1 generation is 25% each for A, B, C, D. So the ratio is 25:25:25:25, or 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed in the options. But the options include 6:2:2:0, which might correspond to something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16 parts, but the question asks for the ratio. Option J is 2:6:2:6, adding up to 16 as well.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But this counts the cases where both C and B are present. However, in our phenotypic classification, any bird with at least one C and at least one B will have Phenotype A. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, then it's Phenotype A. If it has C but not B, it's Phenotype B. If it has B but not C, it's Phenotype C. If neither, Phenotype D.\n\nSo, the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither present): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios: \n\n- Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options given, option G states the ratio as checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that seems different. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation without considering the exact dominance, but I don't think so. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation when considering the actual number of each phenotype, not just the ratio. Wait, looking at the options, none directly match 9:3:3:1 except option G, which says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 generation is CcBb. They self, so the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From each parent: CB and cb. So the F2 will have four combinations:\n\n  1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n  2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n  3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n  4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these four combinations occurs with equal probability (25% each). So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype B: Only from CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C: Only from cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D: Only from cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 75:25:25:25, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1 when divided by 25. But this still doesn't align with the given options. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation considering the F1 itself. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine the original question.\n\nThe original question says: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Wait, but the options provided (A-G) list various ratios, including 6:2:2:0, etc. Perhaps I've miscalculated. Let me try another approach. Considering each gene separately:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nSince these genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and brown (B): This requires cc and B. So the probability is (25% cc) * (50% B) = 12.5% (or 1/8)\n2. Checkered (c) and plain (B): (25% cc) * (50% B) = 12.5% \n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): (25% cc) * (50% B) = 12.5%\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% (or 1/16)\n\nAdding these up: 12.5 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 43.75%, which doesn't add up to 100%, indicating an error in calculation. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises because each bird has two traits, and the correct approach is to consider combinations. Instead, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation, combining both genes.\n\nLet me create a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nGenotypes for the C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nGenotypes for the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, I'll enumerate all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nHowever, this might take too long. An alternative approach is to note that for each gene, the probabilities are 25%, 50%, 25%. Combining these for both genes, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options seem to match this exactly. Wait, looking at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense. Option H is 5:3:2:9, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 parts, but the overall sum should be 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let me recalculate the F1 phenotypic ratio. F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nThe F1 generation is 25% each for A, B, C, D. So the ratio is 25:25:25:25, or 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed in the options. But the options include 6:2:2:0, which might correspond to something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16 parts, but the question asks for the ratio. Option J is 2:6:2:6, adding up to 16 as well. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also sums to 16. Option H is 5:3:2:9, totaling 19, which doesn't add up. Option A is 6:2:6:2, summing to 16. Option B is 6:2:6:2, same as A. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches what I thought earlier, but it's not presented in the options. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which also sums to 16. So the closest to 9:3:3:1 is option C, but it's not available. The next closest is option D, which is 1:3:9:3, but that's inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different convention.\n\nWait, the options provided are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nLooking at my previous calculations, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option C has 9:3:3:1, which seems correct. However, option C is not listed as an answer choice. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2. The F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation with a different approach. Wait, perhaps I should consider the dihybrid cross more carefully. The F2 generation would have 25% for each genotype, leading to phenotypes as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 25% (from CcBb x CcBb) \u2192 Phenotype A: 75% of the F2\n- Phenotype B (only C present): 25% \u2192 Phenotype B: 25% of F2\n- Phenotype C (only B present): 25% \u2192 Phenotype C: 25% of F2\n- Phenotype D (none present): 25% \u2192 Phenotype D: 25% of F2\n\nWait, this still doesn't add up correctly because 75% + 25% + 25% + 25% equals 150%, which is impossible. Clearly, my approach is flawed. The correct method is to realize that each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratios must account for this. The correct ratio for a dihybrid cross with independent genes is indeed 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C (but option C is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed as an option). Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to a different kind of cross or made a mistake in the options.\n\nGiven the options, the closest correct ratio is option G (12:2:2:0), but this doesn't align with the standard dihybrid cross results. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and it's a monozygotic cross or something else.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Class B: C present, B absent.",
    "rollout": " Class B: C present, B absent. - Probability C present: 3/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Joint probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B present: 3/4\n- Joint probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nClass D: Both C and B absent. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Joint probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nTotal ratio = 16 parts\nClass A: 9 parts\nClass B: 3 parts\nClass C: 3 parts\nClass D: 1 part\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 that seems off because our calculation shows Class D is 1 part, which would correspond to plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red (Class C) : Checkered brown (Class D) : Plain red (Class A) : Plain brown (Class B). Wait, no\u2014let me double-check. The phenotypes are ordered as follows:\n\n- Checkered red (Class C) is plain and brown, but according to our earlier breakdown, Class C is plain and brown, and Class D is plain and checkered. Hmm, maybe I got the ordering wrong. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (A)\n2. Checkered brown (D)\n3. Plain red (C)\n4. Plain brown (B)\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That doesn't match our ratio. Option H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also doesn't fit. Option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" No, that's different. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" No. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" No. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation: 9 Checkered red (A), 3 Checkered brown (D), 3 plain red (C), 1 plain brown (B). Wait, no\u2014the order was A, B, C, D, so in terms of phenotype names, it's:\n\n- A: Checkered red\n- B: Plain brown\n- C: Checkered brown\n- D: Plain red\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought the classes were:\n\n- A: Checkered red\n- B: Plain brown\n- C: Checkered brown\n- D: Plain red\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele) and B is present (any B allele): Phenotype 1: Checkered red (A)\n- If C is present and B is absent: Phenotype 2: Checkered brown (D)\n- If C is absent and B is present: Phenotype 3: Plain red (C)\n- If C is absent and B is absent: Phenotype 4: Plain brown (B)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. Wait, looking again: Option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which is not matching. Option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" still not matching. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" No. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" No. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes! This matches exactly. So the answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. - Probability C present: 3/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Joint probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nClass C: C absent, B present. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B present: 3/4\n- Joint probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nClass D: Both C and B absent. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Joint probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nTotal ratio = 16 parts\nClass A: 9 parts\nClass B: 3 parts\nClass C: 3 parts\nClass D: 1 part\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2014 that seems off because our calculation shows Class D is 1 part, which would correspond to plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red (Class C) : Checkered brown (Class D) : Plain red (Class A) : Plain brown (Class B). Wait, no\u2014let me double-check. The phenotypes are ordered as follows:\n\n- Checkered red (Class C) is plain and brown, but according to our earlier breakdown, Class C is plain and brown, and Class D is plain and checkered. Hmm, maybe I got the ordering wrong. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (A)\n2. Checkered brown (D)\n3. Plain red (C)\n4. Plain brown (B)\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That doesn't match our ratio. Option H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also doesn't fit. Option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" No, that's different. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" No. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" No. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation: 9 Checkered red (A), 3 Checkered brown (D), 3 plain red (C), 1 plain brown (B). Wait, no\u2014the order was A, B, C, D, so in terms of phenotype names, it's:\n\n- A: Checkered red\n- B: Plain brown\n- C: Checkered brown\n- D: Plain red\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought the classes were:\n\n- A: Checkered red\n- B: Plain brown\n- C: Checkered brown\n- D: Plain red\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele) and B is present (any B allele): Phenotype 1: Checkered red (A)\n- If C is present and B is absent: Phenotype 2: Checkered brown (D)\n- If C is absent and B is present: Phenotype 3: Plain red (C)\n- If C is absent and B is absent: Phenotype 4: Plain brown (B)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. Wait, looking again: Option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which is not matching. Option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" still not matching. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" No. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" No. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes! This matches exactly. So the answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate.",
    "rollout": " Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because for a bird to have both C and B present, it needs to have at least one C and at least one B allele. So the complementary probability is that the bird does not have at least one C or does not have at least one B. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nP(both C and B) = 1 - P(not C) - P(not B) + P(neither C nor B)\n\nWhere:\n- P(not C) = 1/4 (since 25% cc)\n- P(not B) = 1/4 (25% bb)\n- P(neither C nor B) = 1/4 (25% cc, but wait, no\u2014if neither C nor B is present, then both alleles are recessive, which is 25%). Wait, no\u2014for C: presence is C present, so not C is cc (25%). Similarly for B: presence is B present, so not B is bb (25%). So the probability that a bird has neither C nor B is 25%. So P(both C and B) = 1 - (1/4 + 1/4) + (1/4) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSo P(A) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16? Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because that's the joint probability of both being present, which is indeed 9/16. Similarly, P(B) = P(C present) * P(not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. P(C) = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16? No, wait, no\u2014P(B) is the probability of having C present and B absent. Which is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, P(D) = P(not C) * P(not B) = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. And P(C \u2229 B) = 9/16. So adding up: 9/16 (A) + 3/16 (B) + 3/16 (C) + 1/16 (D) = 16/16 = 1. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in F2: Total F2 birds = 16 (assuming 16 F2 individuals). So the phenotypic counts would be:\n\nPhenotype A: 9 birds\nPhenotype B: 3 birds\nPhenotype C: 3 birds\nPhenotype D: 1 bird\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. But looking at the options provided, none directly match this. Hmm, let me double-check. Maybe I misapplied something. Another approach is to list all possible genotypic combinations and count the phenotypes accordingly. Each F2 bird can have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach combination results in a particular phenotype. So let's list all 9 combinations:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype C: Cases 3,7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cases 5,8,9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nTotal F2 birds = 9 (since 3\u00d73 grid, but each cell represents one bird).\n\nWait, but earlier calculation suggested 16 birds. Hmm, confusion arises because the F2 generation is typically considered as 16 birds when each gene has two alleles with 50% chance. But in reality, each gene has three possible phenotypic classes, leading to nine possible phenotypic combinations. So the correct count would be:\n\nPhenotype A: 2 birds\nPhenotype B: 2 birds\nPhenotype C: 2 birds\nPhenotype D: 3 birds\n\nAdding up to 9 birds. So the phenotypic ratio would be 2:A, 2:B, 2:C, 3:D. Looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Not matching. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This seems more balanced than our calculations, suggesting perhaps a different approach was taken. Maybe the question considers dominance differently or uses a different method to calculate the phenotypic ratios without accounting for all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, but the given answer options don't seem to fit. Upon reviewing, I realize that my initial approach may have been flawed because I didn't account for the fact that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the combination of both. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should reflect that each bird can have red, brown, plain, or checkered, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. Re-evaluating, the correct ratio should sum up the number of birds with each phenotype. Based on the Punnett square analysis, the correct ratio is 3 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, and 0 plain brown. Wait, no, according to the Punnett square breakdown earlier, Phenotype A: 2 birds, B: 2, C: 2, D:3. Adding to 9 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 2:A, 2:B, 2:C, 3:D. None of the options exactly match this. Perhaps the options were presented incorrectly or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question. However, looking at the options, option E states a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This totals 16 birds, which aligns with the standard Punnett square setup when each gene is considered separately. But according to my earlier analysis, the correct ratio should be 2:A, 2:B, 2:C, 3:D. However, since none of the options perfectly match this, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question or the options. Alternatively, perhaps the original question intended to assume that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, and thus the ratio would be 4 each, but that contradicts the calculations. After careful consideration, I believe the correct ratio based on the proper Punnett square analysis is 2 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 3 plain brown, totaling 9 birds. However, since this isn't among the options, I might have overlooked something. Reassessing the question, perhaps the focus is on the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios without considering the exact counts, but rather the simplified ratio. Alternatively, the options might have rounded numbers. Considering the options, option E's ratio adds up to 16 birds, which would correspond to the standard Punnett square setup, but the actual correct ratio based on the calculation is 9 birds. Since option E sums to 16, which is correct for a standard diploid scenario, but the question asks for the correct ratio, I suspect the intended answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because for a bird to have both C and B present, it needs to have at least one C and at least one B allele. So the complementary probability is that the bird does not have at least one C or does not have at least one B. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nP(both C and B) = 1 - P(not C) - P(not B) + P(neither C nor B)\n\nWhere:\n- P(not C) = 1/4 (since 25% cc)\n- P(not B) = 1/4 (25% bb)\n- P(neither C nor B) = 1/4 (25% cc, but wait, no\u2014if neither C nor B is present, then both alleles are recessive, which is 25%). Wait, no\u2014for C: presence is C present, so not C is cc (25%). Similarly for B: presence is B present, so not B is bb (25%). So the probability that a bird has neither C nor B is 25%. So P(both C and B) = 1 - (1/4 + 1/4) + (1/4) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSo P(A) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16? Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because that's the joint probability of both being present, which is indeed 9/16. Similarly, P(B) = P(C present) * P(not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. P(C) = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16? No, wait, no\u2014P(B) is the probability of having C present and B absent. Which is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, P(D) = P(not C) * P(not B) = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. And P(C \u2229 B) = 9/16. So adding up: 9/16 (A) + 3/16 (B) + 3/16 (C) + 1/16 (D) = 16/16 = 1. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in F2: Total F2 birds = 16 (assuming 16 F2 individuals). So the phenotypic counts would be:\n\nPhenotype A: 9 birds\nPhenotype B: 3 birds\nPhenotype C: 3 birds\nPhenotype D: 1 bird\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. But looking at the options provided, none directly match this. Hmm, let me double-check. Maybe I misapplied something. Another approach is to list all possible genotypic combinations and count the phenotypes accordingly. Each F2 bird can have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach combination results in a particular phenotype. So let's list all 9 combinations:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype C: Cases 3,7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cases 5,8,9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nTotal F2 birds = 9 (since 3\u00d73 grid, but each cell represents one bird).\n\nWait, but earlier calculation suggested 16 birds. Hmm, confusion arises because the F2 generation is typically considered as 16 birds when each gene has two alleles with 50% chance. But in reality, each gene has three possible phenotypic classes, leading to nine possible phenotypic combinations. So the correct count would be:\n\nPhenotype A: 2 birds\nPhenotype B: 2 birds\nPhenotype C: 2 birds\nPhenotype D: 3 birds\n\nAdding up to 9 birds. So the phenotypic ratio would be 2:A, 2:B, 2:C, 3:D. Looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Not matching. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This seems more balanced than our calculations, suggesting perhaps a different approach was taken. Maybe the question considers dominance differently or uses a different method to calculate the phenotypic ratios without accounting for all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, but the given answer options don't seem to fit. Upon reviewing, I realize that my initial approach may have been flawed because I didn't account for the fact that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the combination of both. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should reflect that each bird can have red, brown, plain, or checkered, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. Re-evaluating, the correct ratio should sum up the number of birds with each phenotype. Based on the Punnett square analysis, the correct ratio is 3 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, and 0 plain brown. Wait, no, according to the Punnett square breakdown earlier, Phenotype A: 2 birds, B: 2, C: 2, D:3. Adding to 9 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 2:A, 2:B, 2:C, 3:D. None of the options exactly match this. Perhaps the options were presented incorrectly or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question. However, looking at the options, option E states a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This totals 16 birds, which aligns with the standard Punnett square setup when each gene is considered separately. But according to my earlier analysis, the correct ratio should be 2:A, 2:B, 2:C, 3:D. However, since none of the options perfectly match this, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question or the options. Alternatively, perhaps the original question intended to assume that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, and thus the ratio would be 4 each, but that contradicts the calculations. After careful consideration, I believe the correct ratio based on the proper Punnett square analysis is 2 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 3 plain brown, totaling 9 birds. However, since this isn't among the options, I might have overlooked something. Reassessing the question, perhaps the focus is on the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios without considering the exact counts, but rather the simplified ratio. Alternatively, the options might have rounded numbers. Considering the options, option E's ratio adds up to 16 birds, which would correspond to the standard Punnett square setup, but the actual correct ratio based on the calculation is 9 birds. Since option E sums to 16, which is correct for a standard diploid scenario, but the question asks for the correct ratio, I suspect the intended answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class A: 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since 1/4 of the birds have bb)\n- Combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, let's sum up the probabilities for each class:\n\n- Class A: 9/16\n- Class B: 3/16\n- Class C: 3/16\n- Class D: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 =16/16=1, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2 (Nope)\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 (No)\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 (Yes, matches our calculation)\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 (In reverse order)\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 (Not matching)\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of C present and B absent is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. The probability of C absent and B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And both C and B absent is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D. Looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" Which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, Option H also has similar numbers. Wait, let me double-check the math. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For each trait, the probability is 3/4 for presence (since dominant allele is present unless recessive). So the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. Hence, the correct answer should reflect this.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

    "rollout": " But wait, no\u2014because each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So for each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:\n\nFor C: Any C allele makes the bird red. So the probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since the bird could have CC, Cc, or Cc).\n\nSimilarly for B: At least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probability of both traits being expressed is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, this seems off because when both C and B are present, the bird has both traits. However, the exact number of phenotypic classes may vary depending on whether both traits are present or not. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the possible genotypes. Let me instead list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigmented red (dominant C)\n- cc: Plain (recessive c)\n\nSimilarly,\n- BB: Brown (B dominant)\n- Bb: Brown (B dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes correspond directly to the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene. Now, we can create a grid to represent all possible combinations of these phenotypes. However, to simplify, we can count the number of each phenotype based on the combinations of C and B.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we calculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present.\nNumber of such birds = (number with C present) * (number with B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect because each bird's genotype is independent, so the actual calculation should be:\n\nTotal number of birds = 16 (for simplicity)\nNumber of birds with C present: 12 (since 3/4 of 16 is 12)\nNumber of birds with B present: 12\nNumber of birds with both C and B present: (12 * 12) / 16 = 144 / 16 = 9\n\nSo Phenotype 1 occurs 9 times.\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent.\nNumber of such birds = (12 C) * (4 B absent) = 12 * 4 = 48 (but wait, B absent would mean B is bb, which is 4/16=1/4. So 12 * 4 = 48? Wait, no\u2014actually, the number of B absent is 4 (since B is bb, which is 1/4 of the population). So 12 (C present) * 4 (B absent) = 48. But since total is 16, 48/16=3. So Phenotype 2 occurs 3 times.\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because 9+3+3+1=16. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let's try another approach. Using the Punnett square method, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (phenotype 1)\n- 50% Cc (phenotype 1)\n- 25% cc (phenotype 4)\n- 25% BB (phenotype 1)\n- 50% Bb (phenotype 1)\n- 25% bb (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- Cc (50%): Phenotype 1 (C present, B absent)\n- cc (25%): Phenotype 4 (both C and B absent)\n- BB (25%): Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- Bb (50%): Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- bb (25%): Phenotype 4 (both C and B absent)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Let me clarify: The F2 genotypes are determined by the combination of each parent's gametes. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- Cc: Phenotype 1 (C present, B absent)\n- cc: Phenotype 4 (both C and B absent)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has C present, it doesn't necessarily have B present unless B is dominant. Similarly, if a bird has B present, it doesn't necessarily have C present. So the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the correct phenotypic classification is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 25% CC\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 50% Cc\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 25% Cc (Wait, no\u2014this is incorrect because Cc can be either C dominant or B dominant, but in reality, Cc would be expressed as red (since C is dominant) regardless of B. Similarly, Bb would also be brown regardless of C.)\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- For the C locus: Presence of C results in red (phenotype 1 for C), else plain (phenotype 4).\n- For the B locus: Presence of B results in brown (phenotype 1 for B), else checkered (phenotype 4).\n\nTherefore, a bird will be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 if both C and B are present \u2192 red and brown\n- Phenotype 2 if C is present and B is absent \u2192 red and checkered\n- Phenotype 3 if C is absent and B is present \u2192 plain and brown\n- Phenotype 4 if neither C nor B is present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present. The probability that a bird has at least one C allele is 3/4, similarly for B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014because each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So for each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:\n\nFor C: Any C allele makes the bird red. So the probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since the bird could have CC, Cc, or Cc).\n\nSimilarly for B: At least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probability of both traits being expressed is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, this seems off because when both C and B are present, the bird has both traits. However, the exact number of phenotypic classes may vary depending on whether both traits are present or not. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the possible genotypes. Let me instead list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigmented red (dominant C)\n- cc: Plain (recessive c)\n\nSimilarly,\n- BB: Brown (B dominant)\n- Bb: Brown (B dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes correspond directly to the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene. Now, we can create a grid to represent all possible combinations of these phenotypes. However, to simplify, we can count the number of each phenotype based on the combinations of C and B.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we calculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present.\nNumber of such birds = (number with C present) * (number with B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect because each bird's genotype is independent, so the actual calculation should be:\n\nTotal number of birds = 16 (for simplicity)\nNumber of birds with C present: 12 (since 3/4 of 16 is 12)\nNumber of birds with B present: 12\nNumber of birds with both C and B present: (12 * 12) / 16 = 144 / 16 = 9\n\nSo Phenotype 1 occurs 9 times.\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent.\nNumber of such birds = (12 C) * (4 B absent) = 12 * 4 = 48 (but wait, B absent would mean B is bb, which is 4/16=1/4. So 12 * 4 = 48? Wait, no\u2014actually, the number of B absent is 4 (since B is bb, which is 1/4 of the population). So 12 (C present) * 4 (B absent) = 48. But since total is 16, 48/16=3. So Phenotype 2 occurs 3 times.\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because 9+3+3+1=16. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let's try another approach. Using the Punnett square method, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (phenotype 1)\n- 50% Cc (phenotype 1)\n- 25% cc (phenotype 4)\n- 25% BB (phenotype 1)\n- 50% Bb (phenotype 1)\n- 25% bb (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- Cc (50%): Phenotype 1 (C present, B absent)\n- cc (25%): Phenotype 4 (both C and B absent)\n- BB (25%): Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- Bb (50%): Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- bb (25%): Phenotype 4 (both C and B absent)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Let me clarify: The F2 genotypes are determined by the combination of each parent's gametes. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Phenotype 1 (both C and B present)\n- Cc: Phenotype 1 (C present, B absent)\n- cc: Phenotype 4 (both C and B absent)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has C present, it doesn't necessarily have B present unless B is dominant. Similarly, if a bird has B present, it doesn't necessarily have C present. So the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the correct phenotypic classification is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 25% CC\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 50% Cc\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 25% Cc (Wait, no\u2014this is incorrect because Cc can be either C dominant or B dominant, but in reality, Cc would be expressed as red (since C is dominant) regardless of B. Similarly, Bb would also be brown regardless of C.)\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- For the C locus: Presence of C results in red (phenotype 1 for C), else plain (phenotype 4).\n- For the B locus: Presence of B results in brown (phenotype 1 for B), else checkered (phenotype 4).\n\nTherefore, a bird will be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 if both C and B are present \u2192 red and brown\n- Phenotype 2 if C is present and B is absent \u2192 red and checkered\n- Phenotype 3 if C is absent and B is present \u2192 plain and brown\n- Phenotype 4 if neither C nor B is present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present. The probability that a bird has at least one C allele is 3/4, similarly for B. Since the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent. This is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present. Similarly, (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present. (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts based on a population size. Let's assume a population of 16 birds for simplicity:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9 birds\n- Phenotype 2: 3 birds\n- Phenotype 3: 3 birds\n- Phenotype 4: 1 bird\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 2:6:3:9\n\nOption C matches our calculation: Phenotype 1 (red and brown) : Phenotype 2 (red and checkered) : Phenotype 3 (plain and brown) : Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options again, option C says \"9, 3, 3, 1,\" which corresponds to our calculation.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

    "rollout": " But wait, that's not entirely accurate because the phenotypes are combinations of dominant traits. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are present, the bird will display both traits. So the number of birds with both traits is (number of birds with C) * (number with B). But perhaps a better approach is to count the number of each phenotype in the F2. For each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Phenotype 1: C present \u2192 red\n- Phenotype 2: c present \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- Phenotype 3: B present \u2192 brown\n- Phenotype 4: b present \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two. The total number of phenotypic classes is 2 (for C) * 2 (for B) = 4. Now, to find the frequency of each class:\n\nClass 1 (Red Brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n- Frequency = (Proportion of C present) * (Proportion of B present)\n- Proportion of C present: 3/4 (since 100% of birds have C)\nWait, no\u2014it's 3/4 because each bird has at least one C allele, so they will always have red.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not entirely accurate because the phenotypes are combinations of dominant traits. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are present, the bird will display both traits. So the number of birds with both traits is (number of birds with C) * (number with B). But perhaps a better approach is to count the number of each phenotype in the F2. For each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Phenotype 1: C present \u2192 red\n- Phenotype 2: c present \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- Phenotype 3: B present \u2192 brown\n- Phenotype 4: b present \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two. The total number of phenotypic classes is 2 (for C) * 2 (for B) = 4. Now, to find the frequency of each class:\n\nClass 1 (Red Brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n- Frequency = (Proportion of C present) * (Proportion of B present)\n- Proportion of C present: 3/4 (since 100% of birds have C)\nWait, no\u2014it's 3/4 because each bird has at least one C allele, so they will always have red. Similarly for B. So the frequency of Class 1 is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nClass 2 (Red Checkered): Occurs when C is present but B is absent.\n- Frequency = (Proportion of C present) * (Proportion of B absent)\n- Proportion of C present: 3/4\n- Proportion of B absent: 1/4 (since 3/4 have B, 1/4 don't)\nSo frequency = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass 3 (Plain Brown): Occurs when C is absent but B is present.\n- Frequency = (Proportion of C absent) * (Proportion of B present)\n- Proportion of C absent: 1/4\n- Proportion of B present: 3/4\nFrequency = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass 4 (Plain Checkered): Occurs when both C and B are absent.\n- Frequency = (Proportion of C absent) * (Proportion of B absent)\n- Both are 1/4, so frequency = 1/16\n\nNow, adding up all phenotypes:\n- Red Brown: 9/16\n- Red Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Checkered: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which adds up to 100%.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nThe correct ratio is option C: 9:3:3:1.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B present, then it's red and brown.",
    "rollout": " But wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B present, then it's red and brown. If it has C present and B absent, it's red and checkered. Similarly for others. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific phenotype. Now, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: CC BB and Cc BB and cc BB \u2192 Total: 3\nPhenotype B: CC Bb and cc Bb \u2192 Total: 2\nPhenotype C: CC bb and Cc bb \u2192 Total: 2\nPhenotype D: Cc Bb and cc bb \u2192 Total: 2\n\nSo the ratio is 3 : 2 : 2 : 2. Adding up, 3+2+2+2=9 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. This doesn't match our calculation of 3:2:2:2. Option J is 2,6,3,9, which also doesn't match. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which isn't matching either. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, but our calculation shows 9 parts. Option D is 1,7,1,3, which sums to 12. Option C is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which adds to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option I is 7,5,1,3, adding to 16. Option G was 12,2,2,2, which is different.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to exactly match our 3:2:2:2 ratio. Let me double-check. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the F2 phenotypes:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype B\n- CC bb: Phenotype C\n- Cc BB: Phenotype B\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype D\n- Cc bb: Phenotype D\n- cc BB: Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Phenotype C\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 bird\n- Phenotype B: 2 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 3 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, in F2, each bird's genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. So the count should be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 (CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB)\n- Phenotype B: 2 (CC Bb, cc Bb)\n- Phenotype C: 2 (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Phenotype D: 2 (Cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nTotal: 3+2+2+2=9 birds. So the ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options again, option E says 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which matches the counts if we had 9 birds with the highest count for Phenotype B. But according to our calculation, Phenotype B only accounts for 2 out of 9. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the user provided a detailed set of gametes for F1 and then presented a Punnett square for F2. Let me look back.\n\nWait, in the user's response, after creating a Punnett square for F2, they listed the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross and the F2 results, including the expected phenotypes. But in the initial part of the problem statement, the user asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. However, in the initial setup, the user created a Punnett square for F1 and then presented the F2 results, including the phenotypes and their ratios. Looking back, the user included a section where they wrote:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\n\"B. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\"\n\n...and so on.\n\nWait, but in the original prompt, the user starts by asking about the F2 generation, but later in the text, after presenting the F1 cross and the F2 results, they list several options with specific ratios. It seems that the user wants us to choose the correct ratio from those options, perhaps based on the F2 analysis.\n\nGiven that, let's go back to the F2 analysis. According to the previous reasoning, the correct ratio is 3:2:2:2 for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown respectively. But looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption D: 1,7,1,3 \u2192 No\nOption J: 2,6,3,9 \u2192 No\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nNone of these options match our 3:2:2:2 ratio. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the F2 phenotypes:\n\nFrom the F2 analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 birds (all C and B present)\n- Phenotype B: 2 birds (C present, B absent)\n- Phenotype C: 2 birds (C absent, B present)\n- Phenotype D: 2 birds (both C and B absent)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, the closest is option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which sums to 16, but our calculation is 9 birds. So perhaps the user made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question. Perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, but that's not what the user asked. The user asked specifically about the F2 generation.\n\nWait, in the initial setup, the user described a cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Then, he presents a Punnett square for a F1 cross, showing the F1 as CcBb. Then, he presents a Punnett square for F2, listing the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross and the resulting F2 phenotypes and their ratios.\n\nLooking back, his last paragraph lists multiple options, including:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\n\"B. ... and so on.\"\n\nBut perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on the standard dihybrid cross for two linked genes, the expected ratio is typically 9:3:3:1. However, in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so the ratio would be based on the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. \n\nIf we consider the dihybrid cross without considering dominance, the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): Any bird with at least one C and one B allele \u2192 Phenotype X\n- Checkered brown (c_B_): Any bird with at least one c and one B allele \u2192 Phenotype Y\n- Plain red (C_bb): Any bird with at least one C and one b allele \u2192 Phenotype Z\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): Any bird with at least one c and one b allele \u2192 Phenotype W\n\nThe number of birds for each phenotype would depend on the probabilities. Let's calculate them properly.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: 3/4 chance of C (dominant), 1/4 chance of c\n- Gene B: 3/4 chance of B (dominant), 1/4 chance of b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products.\n\nPhenotype X (C_B_):\n\nProbability = 3/4 (C) * 3/4 (B) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype Y (c_B_):\n\nProbability = 1/4 (c) * 3/4 (B) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype Z (C_bb):\n\nProbability = 3/4 (C) * 1/4 (b) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype W (cc_B_):\n\nProbability = 1/4 (c) * 1/4 (b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this exact ratio. Let's check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum to 18\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption D:1,7,1,3\u2192 Sum to 12\nOption J:2,6,3,9\u2192 Sum to 20\nOption A:6,2,6,2\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption B:8,4,0,4\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u2192 Sum to 16\n\nHmm, none of them sum to 16 except option E and option A. But our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2, but that contradicts the user's request.\n\nWait, going back to the user's instructions, the question is about the F2 generation, but in the initial part, he describes a cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), then presents a Punnett square for the F1 cross, followed by another square for F2. The F2 shown includes the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross and the resulting phenotypes along with their ratios.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. But according to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, the user's final sentence ends with \"Then, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options do not include this. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nGiven that, and considering the closest match to our calculation, option E is 3,9,1,3, which may correspond to Phenotype C (checkered red) : Phenotype B (checkered brown) : Phenotype A (plain red) : Phenotype D (plain brown). However, our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, so Phenotype C and A would be higher than B and D.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the phenotypes mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both genes are present (C_B_), i.e., red and brown\n- Phenotype B: Only C is present (C_b_), i.e., red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: Only B is present (Cc_B), i.e., plain red and brown\n- Phenotype D: Neither is present (cc_B_), i.e., plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype C : Phenotype D = 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. The question specifies that red is dominant over plain, and brown over checkered. So, in terms of the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: c_B_\n- Plain red: cc_B_\n- Plain brown: C_bb\n\nWhich brings us back to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the user made a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 cross, but that doesn't make sense because the F1 is already CcBb. Unless the user refers to F1 \u00d7 F1, which would produce F2. But in that case, the F2 would have the same ratio as the F1, which is 3:2:2:1, but scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2 with the same relative frequency as the F1 itself, leading to the same phenotypic ratio. However, the options provided don't include 3:2:2:1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user confused F1 and F2. Let's assume the question is about the F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb, and the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross would produce the following genotypes:\n\nEach parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and bc.\n\nWhen crossed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. (CB)(CB) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n2. (CB)(cb) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n3. (CB)(cB) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n4. (CB)(bc) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n5. (cb)(cb) \u2192 ccBB (phenotype cc_B_)\n6. (cb)(bc) \u2192 ccBb (phenotype cc_B_)\n7. (cB)(cb) \u2192 ccBb (phenotype cc_B_)\n8. (cB)(bc) \u2192 ccBb (phenotype cc_B_)\n9. (bc)(bc) \u2192 ccbb (phenotype cc_bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each parent can produce four types of gametes, so the Punnett square should have 16 possible combinations. However, many of these will lead to the same phenotypes. Let's recast it correctly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc.\n\nCreating a Punnett square:\n\n       | CB | cb | cB | bc\n-------|----|----|----|----\n     CB | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n     cb | CcBb | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb\n     cB | CcBb | ccBb | CcBb | CcBb\n     bc | CcBb | ccBb | CcBb | ccBb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each parent's gametes produce alleles, so the Punnett square should have 16 cells, each representing a possible genotype. But given the complexities, perhaps it's easier to note that the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross would produce a certain phenotypic distribution based on the F1 genotypes. However, this might get too complicated, and perhaps the intended answer is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the options. Given the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option E: 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to Phenotype C (checkered red) : Phenotype B (checkered brown) : Phenotype A (plain red) : Phenotype D (plain brown). But according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the discrepancy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B present, then it's red and brown. If it has C present and B absent, it's red and checkered. Similarly for others. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific phenotype. Now, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: CC BB and Cc BB and cc BB \u2192 Total: 3\nPhenotype B: CC Bb and cc Bb \u2192 Total: 2\nPhenotype C: CC bb and Cc bb \u2192 Total: 2\nPhenotype D: Cc Bb and cc bb \u2192 Total: 2\n\nSo the ratio is 3 : 2 : 2 : 2. Adding up, 3+2+2+2=9 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. This doesn't match our calculation of 3:2:2:2. Option J is 2,6,3,9, which also doesn't match. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which isn't matching either. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, but our calculation shows 9 parts. Option D is 1,7,1,3, which sums to 12. Option C is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which adds to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option I is 7,5,1,3, adding to 16. Option G was 12,2,2,2, which is different.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to exactly match our 3:2:2:2 ratio. Let me double-check. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the F2 phenotypes:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype B\n- CC bb: Phenotype C\n- Cc BB: Phenotype B\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype D\n- Cc bb: Phenotype D\n- cc BB: Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Phenotype C\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1 bird\n- Phenotype B: 2 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 3 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, in F2, each bird's genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. So the count should be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 (CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB)\n- Phenotype B: 2 (CC Bb, cc Bb)\n- Phenotype C: 2 (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Phenotype D: 2 (Cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nTotal: 3+2+2+2=9 birds. So the ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options again, option E says 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which matches the counts if we had 9 birds with the highest count for Phenotype B. But according to our calculation, Phenotype B only accounts for 2 out of 9. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the user provided a detailed set of gametes for F1 and then presented a Punnett square for F2. Let me look back.\n\nWait, in the user's response, after creating a Punnett square for F2, they listed the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross and the F2 results, including the expected phenotypes. But in the initial part of the problem statement, the user asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. However, in the initial setup, the user created a Punnett square for F1 and then presented the F2 results, including the phenotypes and their ratios. Looking back, the user included a section where they wrote:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\n\"B. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\"\n\n...and so on.\n\nWait, but in the original prompt, the user starts by asking about the F2 generation, but later in the text, after presenting the F1 cross and the F2 results, they list several options with specific ratios. It seems that the user wants us to choose the correct ratio from those options, perhaps based on the F2 analysis.\n\nGiven that, let's go back to the F2 analysis. According to the previous reasoning, the correct ratio is 3:2:2:2 for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown respectively. But looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption D: 1,7,1,3 \u2192 No\nOption J: 2,6,3,9 \u2192 No\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nNone of these options match our 3:2:2:2 ratio. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the F2 phenotypes:\n\nFrom the F2 analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3 birds (all C and B present)\n- Phenotype B: 2 birds (C present, B absent)\n- Phenotype C: 2 birds (C absent, B present)\n- Phenotype D: 2 birds (both C and B absent)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, the closest is option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which sums to 16, but our calculation is 9 birds. So perhaps the user made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question. Perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, but that's not what the user asked. The user asked specifically about the F2 generation.\n\nWait, in the initial setup, the user described a cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Then, he presents a Punnett square for a F1 cross, showing the F1 as CcBb. Then, he presents a Punnett square for F2, listing the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross and the resulting F2 phenotypes and their ratios.\n\nLooking back, his last paragraph lists multiple options, including:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\n\"B. ... and so on.\"\n\nBut perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on the standard dihybrid cross for two linked genes, the expected ratio is typically 9:3:3:1. However, in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so the ratio would be based on the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. \n\nIf we consider the dihybrid cross without considering dominance, the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): Any bird with at least one C and one B allele \u2192 Phenotype X\n- Checkered brown (c_B_): Any bird with at least one c and one B allele \u2192 Phenotype Y\n- Plain red (C_bb): Any bird with at least one C and one b allele \u2192 Phenotype Z\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): Any bird with at least one c and one b allele \u2192 Phenotype W\n\nThe number of birds for each phenotype would depend on the probabilities. Let's calculate them properly.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: 3/4 chance of C (dominant), 1/4 chance of c\n- Gene B: 3/4 chance of B (dominant), 1/4 chance of b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products.\n\nPhenotype X (C_B_):\n\nProbability = 3/4 (C) * 3/4 (B) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype Y (c_B_):\n\nProbability = 1/4 (c) * 3/4 (B) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype Z (C_bb):\n\nProbability = 3/4 (C) * 1/4 (b) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype W (cc_B_):\n\nProbability = 1/4 (c) * 1/4 (b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this exact ratio. Let's check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum to 18\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption D:1,7,1,3\u2192 Sum to 12\nOption J:2,6,3,9\u2192 Sum to 20\nOption A:6,2,6,2\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption B:8,4,0,4\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4\u2192 Sum to 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u2192 Sum to 16\n\nHmm, none of them sum to 16 except option E and option A. But our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2, but that contradicts the user's request.\n\nWait, going back to the user's instructions, the question is about the F2 generation, but in the initial part, he describes a cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), then presents a Punnett square for the F1 cross, followed by another square for F2. The F2 shown includes the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross and the resulting phenotypes along with their ratios.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. But according to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, the user's final sentence ends with \"Then, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options do not include this. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nGiven that, and considering the closest match to our calculation, option E is 3,9,1,3, which may correspond to Phenotype C (checkered red) : Phenotype B (checkered brown) : Phenotype A (plain red) : Phenotype D (plain brown). However, our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, so Phenotype C and A would be higher than B and D.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the phenotypes mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both genes are present (C_B_), i.e., red and brown\n- Phenotype B: Only C is present (C_b_), i.e., red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: Only B is present (Cc_B), i.e., plain red and brown\n- Phenotype D: Neither is present (cc_B_), i.e., plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype C : Phenotype D = 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. The question specifies that red is dominant over plain, and brown over checkered. So, in terms of the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: c_B_\n- Plain red: cc_B_\n- Plain brown: C_bb\n\nWhich brings us back to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the user made a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 cross, but that doesn't make sense because the F1 is already CcBb. Unless the user refers to F1 \u00d7 F1, which would produce F2. But in that case, the F2 would have the same ratio as the F1, which is 3:2:2:1, but scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2 with the same relative frequency as the F1 itself, leading to the same phenotypic ratio. However, the options provided don't include 3:2:2:1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user confused F1 and F2. Let's assume the question is about the F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb, and the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross would produce the following genotypes:\n\nEach parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and bc.\n\nWhen crossed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. (CB)(CB) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n2. (CB)(cb) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n3. (CB)(cB) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n4. (CB)(bc) \u2192 CcBb (phenotype C_B_)\n5. (cb)(cb) \u2192 ccBB (phenotype cc_B_)\n6. (cb)(bc) \u2192 ccBb (phenotype cc_B_)\n7. (cB)(cb) \u2192 ccBb (phenotype cc_B_)\n8. (cB)(bc) \u2192 ccBb (phenotype cc_B_)\n9. (bc)(bc) \u2192 ccbb (phenotype cc_bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each parent can produce four types of gametes, so the Punnett square should have 16 possible combinations. However, many of these will lead to the same phenotypes. Let's recast it correctly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc.\n\nCreating a Punnett square:\n\n       | CB | cb | cB | bc\n-------|----|----|----|----\n     CB | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n     cb | CcBb | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb\n     cB | CcBb | ccBb | CcBb | CcBb\n     bc | CcBb | ccBb | CcBb | ccBb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each parent's gametes produce alleles, so the Punnett square should have 16 cells, each representing a possible genotype. But given the complexities, perhaps it's easier to note that the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross would produce a certain phenotypic distribution based on the F1 genotypes. However, this might get too complicated, and perhaps the intended answer is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the options. Given the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option E: 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to Phenotype C (checkered red) : Phenotype B (checkered brown) : Phenotype A (plain red) : Phenotype D (plain brown). But according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the discrepancy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, the probability of red (C) alone is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16, and the probability of checkered (b) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.",

For brown (B) alone, it's (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16, and plain (b) is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Wait, but our phenotypes are combinations of both traits. So let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B traits. So for Phenotype A (red and brown), both C and B must be present. The probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (red and checkered): Only C is present, B is absent. Probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (plain and brown): Only B is present, C is absent. Probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered): Neither C nor B is present. Probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, to get the phenotypic ratio, we sum up the number of each phenotype relative to the total. So:\n\nPhenotype A: 9/16\nPhenotype B: 3/16\nPhenotype C: 3/16\nPhenotype D: 1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking back at the options given, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of red (C) alone is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16, and the probability of checkered (b) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Alternatively, we can look at the F2 genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the phenotypic ratio based on the genetic distances. The number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds that have both dominant alleles for both genes. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. Since the two genes are independent, the probability of both being present is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of exactly one dominant allele is 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16, and the probability of none is 1/16. But wait, that's not quite right because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the trait is expressed. Wait, no\u2014each trait is expressed if the allele is dominant.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't directly translate to the presence of the other. Instead, the presence of C or B is what determines the trait. So the probability that a bird has both traits (C and B dominant) is (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only C present (but B absent) is (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of having only B present (C absent) is (prob B present) * (prob C absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of neither trait being present (both C and B absent) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts.

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But that's not directly helpful. Instead, we need to count the number of each phenotype in the F2. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. Using the Punnett square approach:\n\nThe F2 will have the following genotypic combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypic breakdown:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when a bird has at least one dominant C and one dominant B.\n  - This happens in 3/4 of the cases for each gene, but since they are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. But instead of counting fractions, we can list the number of each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nPhenotype A (Red and Brown): All birds with at least one C and one B. So, for each C genotype (CC, Cc), and each B genotype (BB, Bb):\n\n- CC-BB: Phenotype A\n- CC-Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc-BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc-Bb: Phenotype A\nSo that's 4 (CC) * 2 (BB and Bb) = 8? Wait, no, wait\u2014each C genotype can pair with each B genotype.\n\nActually, for each C (either CC or Cc) and each B (either BB or Bb), the bird will have Phenotype A. Since there are 2 C genotypes and 2 B genotypes, the total number is 2*2=4, but since each combination results in Phenotype A, that's 4. Wait, no, because each bird is a combination of one C and one B allele. Wait, no\u2014it's better to count based on the number of possible combinations.\n\nEach bird has two C alleles and two B alleles. The possible genotypes leading to Phenotype A are those where the bird has at least one dominant C and one dominant B. So:\n\n- For C: 3 possibilities (CC, Cc, cc) \u2192 3 out of 4\n- For B: 3 possibilities (BB, Bb, bb) \u2192 3 out of 4\nThus, the fraction is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. But in terms of counts, in 16 birds, 9 will have Phenotype A. Wait, no\u2014because each bird is a combination of one C and one B allele. Let's think differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: At least one C, none B \u2192 3 birds (only C dominant, B recessive)\n- Phenotype C: None C, at least one B \u2192 3 birds (none C, B dominant)\n- Phenotype D: None C, none B \u2192 1 bird (both recessive)\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B are present \u2192 9 birds (all except 3 where either C is missing or B is missing)\n- Phenotype B: Only C present, B missing \u2192 3 birds (where B is recessive)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present, C missing \u2192 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, totaling 16.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 which matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Similarly, the probability of exactly one dominant allele is 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16, and the probability of none is (1/4)^2 = 1/16.",
    "rollout": " Similarly, the probability of exactly one dominant allele is 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16, and the probability of none is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. But since our classes are based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact number, we need to adjust accordingly. Alternatively, using a Punnett square approach:\n\nThe F2 generation's Punnett square will look like this for the F2 birds:\n\n|       | CB    | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CC   | Cc    |\n| cb    | Cc    | cc    |\n\nEach cell represents the genotype for each gene. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red (since C is dominant), plain (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigmented red (dominant C), checkered (since B is recessive)\n- cc: Plain, checkered\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n1. Red and brown: All the birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. This includes CC (both C and B), Cc (has C and may have B?), Wait no\u2014CC has C but not necessarily B. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is CC, then B is recessive, so it's red and plain. Similarly, Cc (with C) but may have B or not. Wait, no\u2014a bird is CC and thus has C, but depending on its genotype for B, it may have brown or checkered. So in the F2, the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- For each bird:\n   - Pigmented: red if C is present, else plain\n   - Body color: brown if B is present, else checkered\nThus, the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown\n2. Only C: red and plain\n3. Only B: plain and brown\n4. Neither: plain and checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Frequency of red and brown: (Number of birds with C and B) / Total birds.\nTotal birds in F2 = 16.\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): All birds with at least one C and at least one B. Which is the sum of:\n- CcBb: Phenotype 1\n- Ccbb: Phenotype 1\n- ccBb: Phenotype 1\n- ccbb: Phenotype 1\nWait, no\u2014using the Punnett square approach, for the F2:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\n- CC (red, plain)\n- Cc (red, checkered)\n- Cc (red, checkered)\n- cc (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in the F2, each bird's genotype is as follows:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n|       | CB     | cb     |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| CB     | CC     | Cc      |\n| cb     | Cc      | cc      |\n\nSo:\n\n- For each bird:\n   - If genotype is CC: red and plain\n   - If genotype is Cc: red and checkered\n   - If genotype is cc: plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype counts are:\n\n- Red and brown: None, because CC has no B allele. So all birds with C will have red, unless they also have B, which is rare.\nWait, no\u2014no, because in the F2 grid above, the cells under \"CB\" are CC and Cc, while under \"cb\" are Cc and cc. So:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Only the birds with C and B. Looking at the F2 grid, only the cells where both C and B are present (i.e., CC and Cc) contribute to Phenotype 1.\n\nWait, but looking back, the F2 grid shows:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (phenotype 1)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Wait, the F2 grid is constructed as follows:\n\nEach row represents the genotype from Parent 1 (F1) and each column from Parent 2 (F1). So:\n\n- Row 1: CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC, CB\n- Row 2: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc, Cb\n- Row 3: cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc, bc\n- Row 4: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc, cb\n\nWait, no, each cell is the combination of the gametes from each parent. So the F2 grid is:\n\nRow 1: CB (from Parent 1) \u00d7 CB (from Parent 2) \u2192 CC (phenotype 1), CB (phenotype 2)\nRow 2: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2), Cb (phenotype 3)\nRow 3: cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2), bc (phenotype 4)\nRow 4: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (phenotype 4), cb (phenotype 5)\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 grid.\n\nIn F2, there are 16 birds. Each bird's genotype corresponds to their phenotype as follows:\n\n- CC: red and plain\n- Cc: red and checkered\n- cc: plain and checkered\n\nSo among the 16:\n\n- How many have C (i.e., Cc and CC)?\n- How many have B (i.e., Cc and Bb, wait no\u2014Bb is not present here).\nWait, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 1 (all red)\n- Cc: 2 (all red checkered)\n- cc: 1 (plain checkered)\n- Additionally, from the previous analysis, there are:\n\nLooking back at the F2 grid, the cells are:\n\n- Row 1 (CB x CB): CC (1), CB (1)\n- Row 2 (CB x cb): Cc (1), Cb (1)\n- Row 3 (cb x CB): Cc (1), bc (1)\n- Row 4 (cb x cb): cc (1), cb (1)\n\nWait, this seems off because each cell represents a unique bird. So total birds:\n\n16 (correct). Now, categorizing each bird's phenotype:\n\n- CC: red, plain\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The F2 grid is built from the F1's gametes, so each bird's genotype is determined by the combination of the F1's gametes. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n- 1 bird with CC (red, plain)\n- 2 birds with Cc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with cc (plain, checkered)\n- 2 birds with Cc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with cc (plain, checkered)\n- 1 bird with Cc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with bc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with cc (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me list all 16 birds:\n\n1. CC \u2192 red, plain\n2. CB \u2192 red, brown\n3. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n4. CB \u2192 red, brown\n5. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n6. Cb \u2192 red, brown\n7. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n8. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n9. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n10. bc \u2192 red, brown\n11. cc \u2192 plain, checkered\n12. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n13. cc \u2192 plain, checkered\n14. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n15. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n16. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each bird's genotype is determined by the F2 grid, which is built from the F1's gametes. So the F2 grid is:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nEach bird is formed by pairing each F1's gamete with another F1's gamete.\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC (phenotype 1)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (phenotype 4)\n\nAdditionally, in the F2 grid, each bird has two traits, so we need to account for both B and B alleles. Let me create the full F2 grid properly:\n\n|       | CB | cb | cb | cb |\n|-------|----|---|---|---|\n| CB    | CC | Cc | Cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | cc | cc | cc | cc |\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me represent it correctly:\n\nEach cell represents a bird's genotype, with rows as F1 gametes (CB, cb) and columns as F1 gametes (CB, cb):\n\nRow 1: CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC (phenotype 1)\nRow 2: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\nRow 3: cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\nRow 4: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (phenotype 4)\n\nThen, filling the grid:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (phenotype 1)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (phenotype 4)\n\nSo the F2 grid looks like:\n\n|       | CB | cb | cb | cb |\n|-------|----|---|---|---|\n| CB    | CC | Cc | Cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | cc | cc | cc | cc |\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n1. CC (red, plain): 1 bird\n2. Cc (red, checkered): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n3. Cc (red, checkered): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n4. Cc (red, checkered): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's recount:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- Row 1 (CB x CB): CC \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Row 2 (CB x cb): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Row 3 (cb x CB): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Row 4 (cb x cb): cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 4)\n\nSimilarly, across the columns:\n\n- Column 1 (CB x CB): CC \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Column 2 (CB x cb): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Column 3 (cb x CB): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Column 4 (cb x cb): cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, but this counts each bird once, so total birds: 4 (from the main diagonal) plus 4 from the rest? Wait no\u2014the grid is 4x4, but each bird is represented by a cell, so 16 birds in total. Let me re-count the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (phenotype 1): 1 bird\n2. Cc (phenotype 2): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n3. Cc (phenotype 2): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n4. Cc (phenotype 2): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\nWait, no\u2014that's wrong because rows 2 and 3 each have Cc, so that's 2 birds in row 2 and 2 in row 3, totaling 4 Cc birds. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me list all 16 birds with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u2192 1\n2. Cc \u2192 1\n3. Cc \u2192 1\n4. Cc \u2192 1\n5. Cc \u2192 1\n6. Cc \u2192 1\n7. Cc \u2192 1\n8. Cc \u2192 1\n9. Cc \u2192 1\n10. Cc \u2192 1\n11. Cc \u2192 1\n12. Cc \u2192 1\n13. cc \u2192 1\n14. cc \u2192 1\n15. cc \u2192 1\n16. cc \u2192 1\n\nWait, that's 16 birds, but earlier analysis suggested that some phenotypes occur multiple times. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pheno 1 (red, plain): Only CC \u2192 1 bird\n- Pheno 2 (red, checkered): Cc \u2192 appears in rows 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24 \u2192 Wait, no, I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the grid:\n\nFrom the grid:\n\n- CC \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Cc \u2192 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014each bird is a cell, so:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: in rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24 \u2192 Wait, that's too many. Wait, no, each bird is a cell, so:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 No, that's 16 birds. Wait, this is confusing. Let me count the number of each phenotype:\n\nFrom the grid:\n\n- CC: 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, no, each bird is a cell, so each cell represents a bird. So:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 No, that's too many. Let me count the 'Cc' cells:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRows 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28 (assuming 25 letters beyond the current grid) \u2014 but without knowing the full grid, it's hard. Alternatively, I'll note that in the F2 grid, the number of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014each cell is a bird, so 16 birds in total. Counting:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, this is still unclear. Let me think differently. Since each F2 bird is a combination of two F1 gametes, and the F1's gametes are CB and cb. So:\n\n- The F2 bird's genotype is determined by the combination of the two F1 gametes.\n\n- The probability of each genotype is:\n\n   - CB \u00d7 CB: 25%\n   - CB \u00d7 cb: 25%\n   - cb \u00d7 CB: 25%\n   - cb \u00d7 cb: 25%\n\nEach of these has a certain phenotype:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: CC \u2192 red, plain\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n3. cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n4. cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC \u2192 1 bird\n- Phenotype 2: Cc \u2192 2 birds (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- Phenotype 3: cc \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014because each F2 bird is a combination of two F1 gametes. So:\n\n- The number of each genotype in F2 is 25% for each. Therefore:\n\n- Number of CC: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Number of Cc: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Number of cc: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nBut wait, in reality, some genotypes may overlap due to dominance. However, since both genes are independently assorting, the number of each genotype is indeed 4 out of 16. But the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes and their counts are:\n\n- CC \u2192 red, plain (4 birds)\n- Cc \u2192 red, checkered (4 birds)\n- cc \u2192 plain, checkered (4 birds)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the options given. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That totals 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of exactly one dominant allele is 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16, and the probability of none is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. But since our classes are based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact number, we need to adjust accordingly. Alternatively, using a Punnett square approach:\n\nThe F2 generation's Punnett square will look like this for the F2 birds:\n\n|       | CB    | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CC   | Cc    |\n| cb    | Cc    | cc    |\n\nEach cell represents the genotype for each gene. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red (since C is dominant), plain (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigmented red (dominant C), checkered (since B is recessive)\n- cc: Plain, checkered\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n1. Red and brown: All the birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. This includes CC (both C and B), Cc (has C and may have B?), Wait no\u2014CC has C but not necessarily B. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is CC, then B is recessive, so it's red and plain. Similarly, Cc (with C) but may have B or not. Wait, no\u2014a bird is CC and thus has C, but depending on its genotype for B, it may have brown or checkered. So in the F2, the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- For each bird:\n   - Pigmented: red if C is present, else plain\n   - Body color: brown if B is present, else checkered\nThus, the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown\n2. Only C: red and plain\n3. Only B: plain and brown\n4. Neither: plain and checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Frequency of red and brown: (Number of birds with C and B) / Total birds.\nTotal birds in F2 = 16.\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): All birds with at least one C and at least one B. Which is the sum of:\n- CcBb: Phenotype 1\n- Ccbb: Phenotype 1\n- ccBb: Phenotype 1\n- ccbb: Phenotype 1\nWait, no\u2014using the Punnett square approach, for the F2:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\n- CC (red, plain)\n- Cc (red, checkered)\n- Cc (red, checkered)\n- cc (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in the F2, each bird's genotype is as follows:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n|       | CB     | cb     |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| CB     | CC     | Cc      |\n| cb     | Cc      | cc      |\n\nSo:\n\n- For each bird:\n   - If genotype is CC: red and plain\n   - If genotype is Cc: red and checkered\n   - If genotype is cc: plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype counts are:\n\n- Red and brown: None, because CC has no B allele. So all birds with C will have red, unless they also have B, which is rare.\nWait, no\u2014no, because in the F2 grid above, the cells under \"CB\" are CC and Cc, while under \"cb\" are Cc and cc. So:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Only the birds with C and B. Looking at the F2 grid, only the cells where both C and B are present (i.e., CC and Cc) contribute to Phenotype 1.\n\nWait, but looking back, the F2 grid shows:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (phenotype 1)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Wait, the F2 grid is constructed as follows:\n\nEach row represents the genotype from Parent 1 (F1) and each column from Parent 2 (F1). So:\n\n- Row 1: CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC, CB\n- Row 2: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc, Cb\n- Row 3: cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc, bc\n- Row 4: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc, cb\n\nWait, no, each cell is the combination of the gametes from each parent. So the F2 grid is:\n\nRow 1: CB (from Parent 1) \u00d7 CB (from Parent 2) \u2192 CC (phenotype 1), CB (phenotype 2)\nRow 2: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2), Cb (phenotype 3)\nRow 3: cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2), bc (phenotype 4)\nRow 4: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (phenotype 4), cb (phenotype 5)\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 grid.\n\nIn F2, there are 16 birds. Each bird's genotype corresponds to their phenotype as follows:\n\n- CC: red and plain\n- Cc: red and checkered\n- cc: plain and checkered\n\nSo among the 16:\n\n- How many have C (i.e., Cc and CC)?\n- How many have B (i.e., Cc and Bb, wait no\u2014Bb is not present here).\nWait, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 1 (all red)\n- Cc: 2 (all red checkered)\n- cc: 1 (plain checkered)\n- Additionally, from the previous analysis, there are:\n\nLooking back at the F2 grid, the cells are:\n\n- Row 1 (CB x CB): CC (1), CB (1)\n- Row 2 (CB x cb): Cc (1), Cb (1)\n- Row 3 (cb x CB): Cc (1), bc (1)\n- Row 4 (cb x cb): cc (1), cb (1)\n\nWait, this seems off because each cell represents a unique bird. So total birds:\n\n16 (correct). Now, categorizing each bird's phenotype:\n\n- CC: red, plain\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- Cc: red, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n- cc: plain, checkered\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The F2 grid is built from the F1's gametes, so each bird's genotype is determined by the combination of the F1's gametes. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n- 1 bird with CC (red, plain)\n- 2 birds with Cc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with cc (plain, checkered)\n- 2 birds with Cc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with cc (plain, checkered)\n- 1 bird with Cc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with bc (red, checkered)\n- 1 bird with cc (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me list all 16 birds:\n\n1. CC \u2192 red, plain\n2. CB \u2192 red, brown\n3. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n4. CB \u2192 red, brown\n5. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n6. Cb \u2192 red, brown\n7. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n8. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n9. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n10. bc \u2192 red, brown\n11. cc \u2192 plain, checkered\n12. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n13. cc \u2192 plain, checkered\n14. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n15. Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n16. cb \u2192 plain, brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each bird's genotype is determined by the F2 grid, which is built from the F1's gametes. So the F2 grid is:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nEach bird is formed by pairing each F1's gamete with another F1's gamete.\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC (phenotype 1)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (phenotype 4)\n\nAdditionally, in the F2 grid, each bird has two traits, so we need to account for both B and B alleles. Let me create the full F2 grid properly:\n\n|       | CB | cb | cb | cb |\n|-------|----|---|---|---|\n| CB    | CC | Cc | Cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | cc | cc | cc | cc |\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me represent it correctly:\n\nEach cell represents a bird's genotype, with rows as F1 gametes (CB, cb) and columns as F1 gametes (CB, cb):\n\nRow 1: CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC (phenotype 1)\nRow 2: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\nRow 3: cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (phenotype 2)\nRow 4: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (phenotype 4)\n\nThen, filling the grid:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (phenotype 1)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (phenotype 2)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (phenotype 4)\n\nSo the F2 grid looks like:\n\n|       | CB | cb | cb | cb |\n|-------|----|---|---|---|\n| CB    | CC | Cc | Cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | Cc | cc | cc | cc |\n| cb    | cc | cc | cc | cc |\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n1. CC (red, plain): 1 bird\n2. Cc (red, checkered): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n3. Cc (red, checkered): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n4. Cc (red, checkered): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's recount:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- Row 1 (CB x CB): CC \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Row 2 (CB x cb): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Row 3 (cb x CB): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Row 4 (cb x cb): cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 4)\n\nSimilarly, across the columns:\n\n- Column 1 (CB x CB): CC \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Column 2 (CB x cb): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Column 3 (cb x CB): Cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 2)\n- Column 4 (cb x cb): cc \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, but this counts each bird once, so total birds: 4 (from the main diagonal) plus 4 from the rest? Wait no\u2014the grid is 4x4, but each bird is represented by a cell, so 16 birds in total. Let me re-count the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (phenotype 1): 1 bird\n2. Cc (phenotype 2): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n3. Cc (phenotype 2): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\n4. Cc (phenotype 2): 2 birds (rows 2 and 3)\nWait, no\u2014that's wrong because rows 2 and 3 each have Cc, so that's 2 birds in row 2 and 2 in row 3, totaling 4 Cc birds. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me list all 16 birds with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u2192 1\n2. Cc \u2192 1\n3. Cc \u2192 1\n4. Cc \u2192 1\n5. Cc \u2192 1\n6. Cc \u2192 1\n7. Cc \u2192 1\n8. Cc \u2192 1\n9. Cc \u2192 1\n10. Cc \u2192 1\n11. Cc \u2192 1\n12. Cc \u2192 1\n13. cc \u2192 1\n14. cc \u2192 1\n15. cc \u2192 1\n16. cc \u2192 1\n\nWait, that's 16 birds, but earlier analysis suggested that some phenotypes occur multiple times. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pheno 1 (red, plain): Only CC \u2192 1 bird\n- Pheno 2 (red, checkered): Cc \u2192 appears in rows 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24 \u2192 Wait, no, I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the grid:\n\nFrom the grid:\n\n- CC \u2192 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Cc \u2192 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014each bird is a cell, so:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: in rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24 \u2192 Wait, that's too many. Wait, no, each bird is a cell, so:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 No, that's 16 birds. Wait, this is confusing. Let me count the number of each phenotype:\n\nFrom the grid:\n\n- CC: 1 bird (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, no, each bird is a cell, so each cell represents a bird. So:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 No, that's too many. Let me count the 'Cc' cells:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRows 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28 (assuming 25 letters beyond the current grid) \u2014 but without knowing the full grid, it's hard. Alternatively, I'll note that in the F2 grid, the number of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014each cell is a bird, so 16 birds in total. Counting:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 4 birds (rows 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18,20,21,23,24) \u2192 Wait, this is still unclear. Let me think differently. Since each F2 bird is a combination of two F1 gametes, and the F1's gametes are CB and cb. So:\n\n- The F2 bird's genotype is determined by the combination of the two F1 gametes.\n\n- The probability of each genotype is:\n\n   - CB \u00d7 CB: 25%\n   - CB \u00d7 cb: 25%\n   - cb \u00d7 CB: 25%\n   - cb \u00d7 cb: 25%\n\nEach of these has a certain phenotype:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: CC \u2192 red, plain\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n3. cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n4. cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC \u2192 1 bird\n- Phenotype 2: Cc \u2192 2 birds (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- Phenotype 3: cc \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014because each F2 bird is a combination of two F1 gametes. So:\n\n- The number of each genotype in F2 is 25% for each. Therefore:\n\n- Number of CC: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Number of Cc: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Number of cc: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nBut wait, in reality, some genotypes may overlap due to dominance. However, since both genes are independently assorting, the number of each genotype is indeed 4 out of 16. But the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes and their counts are:\n\n- CC \u2192 red, plain (4 birds)\n- Cc \u2192 red, checkered (4 birds)\n- cc \u2192 plain, checkered (4 birds)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the options given. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That totals 16",

  {
    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic class is determined by whether each gene is present.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic class is determined by whether each gene is present. So the correct calculation for each class:\n\nClass A: Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\nProbability: (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\nProbability: (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\nProbability: (prob C absent) * (prob B present) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\nProbability: (prob C absent) * (prob B absent) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 for Classes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, option H says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that seems inconsistent with our calculations. Our ratio was 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts red and brown, 3 parts red and checkered, 3 parts plain and brown, and 1 part plain and checkered.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Close but not matching.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, but the order in the options is different. Option B lists checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1.\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No match.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches exactly except for the order. Looking back, the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. In our calculation, checkered red corresponds to Class C (plain and checkered), which had a probability of 1/16. But according to the options, checkered red is listed as the first category. Hmm, I think I may have mixed up the classes earlier. Let me double-check the definitions. Maybe I got the classes reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the classes. Let me re-examine:\n\nClass A: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\nClass B: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\nClass C: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\nClass D: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype C?) Wait, no\u2014checkered is when both are recessive. So checkered is Phenotype D: plain and checkered. Wait, but in terms of the letters, checkered is usually denoted by 'b', so perhaps the names are:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc and bb), resulting in a dark, plain bird.\n- Plain: both alleles are dominant (CC and BB), resulting in a white, plain bird.\n- Pigment red: dominant C allele, regardless of B.\n- Pigment brown: dominant B allele, regardless of C.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (Class A)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Class B)\n3. Plain and brown (Class C)\n4. Plain and checkered (Class D)\n\nThe probabilities were:\n\nA: 9/16\nB: 3/16\nC: 3/16\nD: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into the answer choices, the option that reflects this ratio is none of them directly. However, looking at the options, option C states a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but the order is checkered red (which is class C), checkered brown (class B), plain red (class A?), plain brown (class D). Wait, perhaps I've misassigned the classes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Class A: red and brown (Phenotype A: red and brown)\n- Class B: red and checkered (Phenotype B: red and checkered)\n- Class C: plain and brown (Phenotype C: plain and brown)\n- Class D: plain and checkered (Phenotype D: plain and checkered)\n\nIn the options, the first number corresponds to checkered red, which is class C. Second to checkered brown, which is class B. Third to plain red, which is class A (since class A is red and brown, but class C is plain and brown). Wait, no\u2014class A is red and brown, while class C is plain and brown. So perhaps the numbers in the options correspond to:\n\nFirst number: Checkered red \u2192 class C (plain and brown)\nSecond number: Checkered brown \u2192 class B (red and checkered)\nThird number: Plain red \u2192 class A (red and brown)\nFourth number: Plain brown \u2192 class D (plain and checkered)\n\nSo the ratio would be plain and brown (3), red and checkered (3), red and brown (9), plain and checkered (1). Which corresponds to option C: 9:3:3:1, but ordered as plain red (A), checkered brown (B), checkered red (C), plain brown (D). But none of the options have this exact ordering. Alternatively, perhaps the options list the phenotypes differently. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches our ratio, but the order is different.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nL. 1,1,3,9 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to perfectly match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the classes. Let me reconsider the classes:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- If C is present, it's pigment red, regardless of B.\n- If B is present, it's brown, regardless of C.\n- Both present: red and brown.\n- Only C present: red.\n- Only B present: brown.\n- Neither present: checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent: red \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. B present, C absent: brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Neither present: checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nEach bird has a 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene, but the combined probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- B present, C absent: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is what I initially thought. Now, looking back at the answer choices, option G is 12:2:2:2, which doesn't match. Option H is 5:3:2:6, also no. None of the options seem to list this exactly. But option C is 9:3:3:1, which is close, but the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the options list the phenotypes in a different order. Let me read the options again.\n\nThe options are labeled from K to L, each listing four numbers representing the counts for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. The correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to:\n\nCheckered red (plain and checkered): 1\nCheckered brown (red and checkered): 3\nPlain red (red and brown): 3\nPlain brown (brown only): 1\n\nBut none of the options list this in the specified order. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Yes, this is exactly our ratio. Even though the labels are different, the numbers are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 9,3,3,1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic class is determined by whether each gene is present. So the correct calculation for each class:\n\nClass A: Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\nProbability: (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\nProbability: (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\nProbability: (prob C absent) * (prob B present) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\nProbability: (prob C absent) * (prob B absent) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 for Classes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, option H says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that seems inconsistent with our calculations. Our ratio was 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts red and brown, 3 parts red and checkered, 3 parts plain and brown, and 1 part plain and checkered.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Close but not matching.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, but the order in the options is different. Option B lists checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1.\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No match.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches exactly except for the order. Looking back, the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. In our calculation, checkered red corresponds to Class C (plain and checkered), which had a probability of 1/16. But according to the options, checkered red is listed as the first category. Hmm, I think I may have mixed up the classes earlier. Let me double-check the definitions. Maybe I got the classes reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the classes. Let me re-examine:\n\nClass A: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\nClass B: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\nClass C: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\nClass D: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype C?) Wait, no\u2014checkered is when both are recessive. So checkered is Phenotype D: plain and checkered. Wait, but in terms of the letters, checkered is usually denoted by 'b', so perhaps the names are:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc and bb), resulting in a dark, plain bird.\n- Plain: both alleles are dominant (CC and BB), resulting in a white, plain bird.\n- Pigment red: dominant C allele, regardless of B.\n- Pigment brown: dominant B allele, regardless of C.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (Class A)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Class B)\n3. Plain and brown (Class C)\n4. Plain and checkered (Class D)\n\nThe probabilities were:\n\nA: 9/16\nB: 3/16\nC: 3/16\nD: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into the answer choices, the option that reflects this ratio is none of them directly. However, looking at the options, option C states a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but the order is checkered red (which is class C), checkered brown (class B), plain red (class A?), plain brown (class D). Wait, perhaps I've misassigned the classes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Class A: red and brown (Phenotype A: red and brown)\n- Class B: red and checkered (Phenotype B: red and checkered)\n- Class C: plain and brown (Phenotype C: plain and brown)\n- Class D: plain and checkered (Phenotype D: plain and checkered)\n\nIn the options, the first number corresponds to checkered red, which is class C. Second to checkered brown, which is class B. Third to plain red, which is class A (since class A is red and brown, but class C is plain and brown). Wait, no\u2014class A is red and brown, while class C is plain and brown. So perhaps the numbers in the options correspond to:\n\nFirst number: Checkered red \u2192 class C (plain and brown)\nSecond number: Checkered brown \u2192 class B (red and checkered)\nThird number: Plain red \u2192 class A (red and brown)\nFourth number: Plain brown \u2192 class D (plain and checkered)\n\nSo the ratio would be plain and brown (3), red and checkered (3), red and brown (9), plain and checkered (1). Which corresponds to option C: 9:3:3:1, but ordered as plain red (A), checkered brown (B), checkered red (C), plain brown (D). But none of the options have this exact ordering. Alternatively, perhaps the options list the phenotypes differently. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Matches our ratio, but the order is different.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nL. 1,1,3,9 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to perfectly match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the classes. Let me reconsider the classes:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- If C is present, it's pigment red, regardless of B.\n- If B is present, it's brown, regardless of C.\n- Both present: red and brown.\n- Only C present: red.\n- Only B present: brown.\n- Neither present: checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent: red \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. B present, C absent: brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Neither present: checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nEach bird has a 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene, but the combined probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- B present, C absent: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is what I initially thought. Now, looking back at the answer choices, option G is 12:2:2:2, which doesn't match. Option H is 5:3:2:6, also no. None of the options seem to list this exactly. But option C is 9:3:3:1, which is close, but the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the options list the phenotypes in a different order. Let me read the options again.\n\nThe options are labeled from K to L, each listing four numbers representing the counts for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. The correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to:\n\nCheckered red (plain and checkered): 1\nCheckered brown (red and checkered): 3\nPlain red (red and brown): 3\nPlain brown (brown only): 1\n\nBut none of the options list this in the specified order. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Yes, this is exactly our ratio. Even though the labels are different, the numbers are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 9,3,3,1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's the probability of having both traits, but our classes are based on the combination of dominant alleles, so each bird can have:",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's the probability of having both traits, but our classes are based on the combination of dominant alleles, so each bird can have:\n\nFor Class A (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present \u2192 1/1 * 1/1 = 1/1. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for each bird:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B are both present \u2192 Red and Brown\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain and Checkered Now, to find the probability of each phenotype, we need to consider the distribution of C and B alleles. Each bird has two copies of each gene, so the number of dominant alleles can vary.\n\nThe probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4. Assuming independence, the probability of having both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B present is also 3/16, and neither present is 1/16. But wait, this approach counts the number of dominant alleles, but the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the count. So the correct way is to look at the phenotypic ratios directly by considering the possible combinations.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B traits. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are four: RR (both dominant), RB (C dominant, B recessive), BR (B dominant, C recessive), and BB (both recessive). But in reality, the phenotypes are:\n\n- RR: Pigment red, Body brown\n- RB: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- BR: Pigment checkered, Body brown\n- BB: Pigment checkered, Body checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb), so each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Using a Punnett square for the F2, we can list all possible combinations and then categorize them into the four phenotypic classes.\n\nLet's construct the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          | Cc | Bb\n----------|----|----\n        Cc | CC | CB | Cc\n        Bb | CB | BB | Bb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C locus:\n\nParent 1: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c\nParent 2: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\nParent 1: Bb \u2192 can produce B and b\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 can produce B and b\n\nSo the Punnett square for the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n```\n          |   C  |   c  |\n----------|-------|-------|\n        C  | CC  | CB  |\n        c  | CB  | cc  |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene is independent. So each cell represents the combination of alleles from each parent. So for the F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSame for B.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- CC (C present) and BB (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and Brown\n- CC and Bb \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and Checkered\n- Cc and BB \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and Brown\n- Cc and Bb \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we can calculate the probabilities based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- P(CC) = 25%\n- P(Cc) = 50%\n- P(cc) = 25%\n\nFor B:\n- P(BB) = 25%\n- P(Bb) = 50%\n- P(bb) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype A (CC and BB):\n- P(CC) * P(BB) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nPhenotype B (CC and Bb):\n- P(CC) * P(Bb) = 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype C (Cc and BB):\n- P(Cc) * P(BB) = 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype D (Cc and Bb):\n- P(Cc) * P(Bb) = 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nWait, but adding these up: 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. That suggests an error in calculation because the sum shouldn't be less than 100%. The mistake arises because the Punnett square includes all combinations without considering the proper probabilities.

Since each gene is inherited independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering the possible combinations.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but let me verify. For two loci with independent traits, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. Here, each trait (red, brown, plain, checkered) corresponds to the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the four possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's the probability of having both traits, but our classes are based on the combination of dominant alleles, so each bird can have:\n\nFor Class A (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present \u2192 1/1 * 1/1 = 1/1. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for each bird:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B are both present \u2192 Red and Brown\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain and Checkered Now, to find the probability of each phenotype, we need to consider the distribution of C and B alleles. Each bird has two copies of each gene, so the number of dominant alleles can vary.\n\nThe probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4. Assuming independence, the probability of having both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B present is also 3/16, and neither present is 1/16. But wait, this approach counts the number of dominant alleles, but the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the count. So the correct way is to look at the phenotypic ratios directly by considering the possible combinations.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B traits. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are four: RR (both dominant), RB (C dominant, B recessive), BR (B dominant, C recessive), and BB (both recessive). But in reality, the phenotypes are:\n\n- RR: Pigment red, Body brown\n- RB: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- BR: Pigment checkered, Body brown\n- BB: Pigment checkered, Body checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb), so each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Using a Punnett square for the F2, we can list all possible combinations and then categorize them into the four phenotypic classes.\n\nLet's construct the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          | Cc | Bb\n----------|----|----\n        Cc | CC | CB | Cc\n        Bb | CB | BB | Bb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C locus:\n\nParent 1: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c\nParent 2: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\nParent 1: Bb \u2192 can produce B and b\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 can produce B and b\n\nSo the Punnett square for the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n```\n          |   C  |   c  |\n----------|-------|-------|\n        C  | CC  | CB  |\n        c  | CB  | cc  |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene is independent. So each cell represents the combination of alleles from each parent. So for the F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSame for B.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- CC (C present) and BB (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and Brown\n- CC and Bb \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and Checkered\n- Cc and BB \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and Brown\n- Cc and Bb \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we can calculate the probabilities based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- P(CC) = 25%\n- P(Cc) = 50%\n- P(cc) = 25%\n\nFor B:\n- P(BB) = 25%\n- P(Bb) = 50%\n- P(bb) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype A (CC and BB):\n- P(CC) * P(BB) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nPhenotype B (CC and Bb):\n- P(CC) * P(Bb) = 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype C (Cc and BB):\n- P(Cc) * P(BB) = 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n\nPhenotype D (Cc and Bb):\n- P(Cc) * P(Bb) = 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nWait, but adding these up: 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. That suggests an error in calculation because the sum shouldn't be less than 100%. The mistake arises because the Punnett square includes all combinations without considering the proper probabilities. Instead, the correct approach is to calculate the number of each type of genotype and then convert to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, a better method is to realize that each bird's phenotype can be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, and the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to recognize that for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele increases the likelihood of expressing that trait.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, no\u2014that's not correct because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant.",
    "rollout": " But wait, no\u2014that's not correct because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for a bird to have both traits, it needs to have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the number of phenotypic classes is 4, as above. The probabilities for each class are:\n\nClass A (both traits): (number of birds with both C and B dominant) / total birds.\n\nTo calculate this, we can look at the possible genotypes and their phenotypes. Each bird has a genotype for each gene. For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant. So the number of birds with both C and B dominant is those who have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Which would include:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- CC bb: Phenotype B (since C is dominant, but B is recessive)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc BB: Phenotype B (C recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B (C recessive, B dominant)\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nSo counting the number of Phenotype A and D:\n\nPhenotype A: 1 (CC BB) + 1 (CC Bb) + 1 (Cc BB) + 1 (Cc Bb) = 4 birds\nPhenotype D: 1 (cc BB) + 1 (cc Bb) = 2 birds\nTotal: 6 birds\n\nPhenotype B: 4 birds (CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb?) Wait no\u2014let me recount:\n\nPhenotype B includes:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A (no, wait, Cc BB: C is dominant, so Phenotype A)\nWait, no\u2014Phenotype B is when C is recessive and B is dominant. So:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nSo the count for Phenotype B is 4 (cc BB, cc Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb?), wait no\u2014actually, looking back, Phenotype B is when C is recessive and B is dominant. So:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's genotype is a combination of their C and B alleles. For the C locus: CC, Cc, cc. For the B locus: BB, Bb, bb. The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nNumber of possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C: 3 (25%, 50%, 25%)\nFor B: 3 (25%, 50%, 25%)\n\nTotal possible genotype combinations: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nNow, assign phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B\n- cc BB: Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nCounting Phenotype A: 4 (all except cc bb and cc Bb)\nPhenotype B: 4 (all except cc BB and cc Bb)\nPhenotype C: 0 (none)\nPhenotype D: 1 (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nA: 4\nB: 4\nC: 0\nD: 1\n\nWhich adds up to 9 birds. Now, converting this to ratios:\n\nA : B : D : C = 4 : 4 : 1 : 0 \u2192 Simplified by dividing by 1 \u2192 4:4:1:0\n\nBut the options given don't match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 This seems off because our calculation shows 4 A, 4 B, 1 D, 0 C.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also different.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC: Present\n- Cc: Present\n- cc: Absent\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- BB: Present\n- Bb: Present\n- bb: Absent\n\nThe phenotype is the combination of these. So, for each bird, if C is present and B is present \u2192 Phenotype A\nIf C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\nIf C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C\nIf both absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nTotal birds: 9\n\nPhenotype A: Only when C is present (either CC or Cc) AND B is present (either BB or Bb). So:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype B: C is present (CC or Cc) AND B is absent (bb). So:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype C: C is absent (cc) AND B is present (BB or Bb). So:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Phenotype C\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype D: Both C and B are absent (cc and bb). So:\n\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\nThat's 1 bird.\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\nA: 4\nB: 2\nC: 2\nD: 1\n\nAdding up to 9 birds. Now, the phenotypic ratio is A:B:C:D = 4:2:2:1.\n\nSimplifying by dividing by 1, the ratio remains 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match this exact ratio. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options are labeled A to I, each providing a different ratio. My calculation suggests 4:2:2:1, but the closest option is F: 4:4:4:4, which is a ratio of 1:1:1:1 for each category. That doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Using the Punnett square for the F2 generation, which involves the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F2 will have the following genotypic ratios for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. The total number of phenotypic classes is 4 (as before). The probabilities for each class are:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither trait): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\nA: 9/16\nB: 3/16\nC: 3/16\nD: 1/16\n\nConverting to ratios: 9:3:3:1\n\nThis simplifies to 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 3:1:1:0.333... but that doesn't help much. Alternatively, considering the number of each phenotype, the ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, the closest match is option F: 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that doesn't match my calculation. Option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Hmm, close but not exact. Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No. Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No. Option F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Closest to 1:1:1:1 but scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the F2 individuals without considering dominance, but that interpretation doesn't make sense. Another possibility is that I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me verify:\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, each gene is considered separately. The phenotypic ratio for two independent genes with dominant-recessive relationships is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A (9), Phenotype B (3), Phenotype C (3), Phenotype D (1). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. The closest option is F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question and it's asking for the ratio within the F1 instead of F2. F1 is CcBb, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio of the F2 compared to the F1, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the options represent the total number of each phenotype, not the ratio relative to something else.\n\nWait, looking again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Total 16\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Total 16\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Total 12\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nMy calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. Option G sums to 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option H sums to 16, but the ratio is 5:3:2:6. Option I sums to 12, and Option F sums to 16, but none matches my 9:3:3:1. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate the counts:\n\nFor Phenotype A: Both C and B are present. How many birds have this?\n\nLooking at the possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent.\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B\n\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present.\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Phenotype C\n\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype D: Neither trait present.\n\nOnly possible genotype: cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nThus, the counts are 4, 2, 2, 1. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1. None of the options match this exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the initial analysis. Let me consider the actual F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 will have these combinations, but the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene.\n\nAnother approach: Use the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have 16 possible genotype combinations (but phenotypically grouped into 4 classes). The number of each phenotypic class can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A (both traits): Number of birds where C is present (either CC or Cc) AND B is present (either BB or Bb).\n\nFrom the possible combinations:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 A\n- CC Bb \u2192 A\n- Cc BB \u2192 A\n- Cc Bb \u2192 A\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent):\n\n- CC bb \u2192 B\n- Cc bb \u2192 B\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present):\n\n- cc BB \u2192 C\n- cc Bb \u2192 C\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype D (neither trait):\n\n- cc bb \u2192 D\nThat's 1 bird.\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, I don't see this ratio. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that doesn't match. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which totals 16 but the ratio is 12:2:2:0. Option I is 7:5:1:3, totaling 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1. Option E is 3:9:1:3. None match 4:2:2:1. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 ratio. Maybe the options are referring to the number of each phenotype, not the ratio. For instance, if the F2 generation has 4 A, 2 B, 2 C, and 1 D, then the numbers are 4, 2, 2, 1. Adding up to 9. But the options provide larger numbers. Let me check what each option represents.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum: 16\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum:16\n\nNone of these sum to 9. Wait, perhaps the options are presenting the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to each other, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the phenotypes with dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones. But that would change the ratio significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reconsider the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotype ratios for each gene:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe number of each phenotypic class in the F2 generation can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: All genotypes where C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014that's not correct because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for a bird to have both traits, it needs to have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the number of phenotypic classes is 4, as above. The probabilities for each class are:\n\nClass A (both traits): (number of birds with both C and B dominant) / total birds.\n\nTo calculate this, we can look at the possible genotypes and their phenotypes. Each bird has a genotype for each gene. For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant. So the number of birds with both C and B dominant is those who have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Which would include:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- CC bb: Phenotype B (since C is dominant, but B is recessive)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc BB: Phenotype B (C recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B (C recessive, B dominant)\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nSo counting the number of Phenotype A and D:\n\nPhenotype A: 1 (CC BB) + 1 (CC Bb) + 1 (Cc BB) + 1 (Cc Bb) = 4 birds\nPhenotype D: 1 (cc BB) + 1 (cc Bb) = 2 birds\nTotal: 6 birds\n\nPhenotype B: 4 birds (CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb?) Wait no\u2014let me recount:\n\nPhenotype B includes:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A (no, wait, Cc BB: C is dominant, so Phenotype A)\nWait, no\u2014Phenotype B is when C is recessive and B is dominant. So:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nSo the count for Phenotype B is 4 (cc BB, cc Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb?), wait no\u2014actually, looking back, Phenotype B is when C is recessive and B is dominant. So:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's genotype is a combination of their C and B alleles. For the C locus: CC, Cc, cc. For the B locus: BB, Bb, bb. The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nNumber of possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C: 3 (25%, 50%, 25%)\nFor B: 3 (25%, 50%, 25%)\n\nTotal possible genotype combinations: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nNow, assign phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B\n- cc BB: Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Phenotype B\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\n\nCounting Phenotype A: 4 (all except cc bb and cc Bb)\nPhenotype B: 4 (all except cc BB and cc Bb)\nPhenotype C: 0 (none)\nPhenotype D: 1 (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nA: 4\nB: 4\nC: 0\nD: 1\n\nWhich adds up to 9 birds. Now, converting this to ratios:\n\nA : B : D : C = 4 : 4 : 1 : 0 \u2192 Simplified by dividing by 1 \u2192 4:4:1:0\n\nBut the options given don't match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 This seems off because our calculation shows 4 A, 4 B, 1 D, 0 C.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also different.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC: Present\n- Cc: Present\n- cc: Absent\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- BB: Present\n- Bb: Present\n- bb: Absent\n\nThe phenotype is the combination of these. So, for each bird, if C is present and B is present \u2192 Phenotype A\nIf C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\nIf C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C\nIf both absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nTotal birds: 9\n\nPhenotype A: Only when C is present (either CC or Cc) AND B is present (either BB or Bb). So:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype B: C is present (CC or Cc) AND B is absent (bb). So:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype C: C is absent (cc) AND B is present (BB or Bb). So:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Phenotype C\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype D: Both C and B are absent (cc and bb). So:\n\n- cc bb: Phenotype D\nThat's 1 bird.\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\nA: 4\nB: 2\nC: 2\nD: 1\n\nAdding up to 9 birds. Now, the phenotypic ratio is A:B:C:D = 4:2:2:1.\n\nSimplifying by dividing by 1, the ratio remains 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match this exact ratio. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options are labeled A to I, each providing a different ratio. My calculation suggests 4:2:2:1, but the closest option is F: 4:4:4:4, which is a ratio of 1:1:1:1 for each category. That doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Using the Punnett square for the F2 generation, which involves the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F2 will have the following genotypic ratios for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. The total number of phenotypic classes is 4 (as before). The probabilities for each class are:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither trait): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\nA: 9/16\nB: 3/16\nC: 3/16\nD: 1/16\n\nConverting to ratios: 9:3:3:1\n\nThis simplifies to 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 3:1:1:0.333... but that doesn't help much. Alternatively, considering the number of each phenotype, the ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, the closest match is option F: 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that doesn't match my calculation. Option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Hmm, close but not exact. Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No. Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No. Option F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Closest to 1:1:1:1 but scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the F2 individuals without considering dominance, but that interpretation doesn't make sense. Another possibility is that I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me verify:\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, each gene is considered separately. The phenotypic ratio for two independent genes with dominant-recessive relationships is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A (9), Phenotype B (3), Phenotype C (3), Phenotype D (1). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. The closest option is F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question and it's asking for the ratio within the F1 instead of F2. F1 is CcBb, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio of the F2 compared to the F1, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the options represent the total number of each phenotype, not the ratio relative to something else.\n\nWait, looking again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Total 16\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Total 16\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Total 12\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nMy calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. Option G sums to 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option H sums to 16, but the ratio is 5:3:2:6. Option I sums to 12, and Option F sums to 16, but none matches my 9:3:3:1. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate the counts:\n\nFor Phenotype A: Both C and B are present. How many birds have this?\n\nLooking at the possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Phenotype A\n- Cc BB: Phenotype A\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype A\n\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent.\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype B\n- Cc bb: Phenotype B\n\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present.\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Phenotype C\n\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype D: Neither trait present.\n\nOnly possible genotype: cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nThus, the counts are 4, 2, 2, 1. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1. None of the options match this exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the initial analysis. Let me consider the actual F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 will have these combinations, but the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene.\n\nAnother approach: Use the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have 16 possible genotype combinations (but phenotypically grouped into 4 classes). The number of each phenotypic class can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A (both traits): Number of birds where C is present (either CC or Cc) AND B is present (either BB or Bb).\n\nFrom the possible combinations:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 A\n- CC Bb \u2192 A\n- Cc BB \u2192 A\n- Cc Bb \u2192 A\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent):\n\n- CC bb \u2192 B\n- Cc bb \u2192 B\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present):\n\n- cc BB \u2192 C\n- cc Bb \u2192 C\nThat's 2 birds.\n\nPhenotype D (neither trait):\n\n- cc bb \u2192 D\nThat's 1 bird.\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, I don't see this ratio. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that doesn't match. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which totals 16 but the ratio is 12:2:2:0. Option I is 7:5:1:3, totaling 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1. Option E is 3:9:1:3. None match 4:2:2:1. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 ratio. Maybe the options are referring to the number of each phenotype, not the ratio. For instance, if the F2 generation has 4 A, 2 B, 2 C, and 1 D, then the numbers are 4, 2, 2, 1. Adding up to 9. But the options provide larger numbers. Let me check what each option represents.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum: 16\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum:16\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum:16\n\nNone of these sum to 9. Wait, perhaps the options are presenting the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to each other, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the phenotypes with dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones. But that would change the ratio significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reconsider the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotype ratios for each gene:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe number of each phenotypic class in the F2 generation can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: All genotypes where C",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not exactly right because it's about the phenotypic expression, not the genotype probabilities. Alternatively, the probability of a bird expressing both traits (red and brown) is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of a bird expressing red and checkered (C present, B absent) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of plain and brown (C absent, B present) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nFinally, the probability of plain and checkered (both C and B absent) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option G says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The user included an option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, why would that be?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate the probabilities. The possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: (probability of C present) * (probability of B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- C absent, B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Both C and B absent: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. So Phenotype A: 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent (i.e., Bb or bb): 1/4\nSo combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Phenotype B: 3/16.\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Phenotype C: 3/16.\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Phenotype D: 1/16.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Which matches exactly what we have here: Checkered red (phenotype D) is 1 part, plain red (phenotype C) is 3 parts, checkered brown (phenotype B) is 3 parts, plain brown (phenotype A) is 9 parts.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of class B: C present and B absent. This would be (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, class C: C absent and B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. And class D: both absent \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so probabilities are correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.

Let's go through each possibility:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present.\n- This happens when the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n- Looking at the Punnett square, the cells where both C and B are present are those where the C allele is present (CC or Cc) AND the B allele is present (BB or Bb).\n- From the Punnett square, the cells are:\n  - Cc \u00d7 Bb: All four cells are CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb?\nWait, no. Wait, the Punnett square for C and B would be a 2x2 grid, resulting in four cells. Each cell represents the combination of one allele from each parent.\n\nSo, for the C locus, the top row is CC, Cc, cc, and the B locus, left column is BB, Bb, bb.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n```\n          | B | b |\n        ---------------\n        |   |   |   |\n          | Cc | Cc | Cc\n        ---------------\n        |    |    |    |\n          |  CB |  cb |  cb\n        ---------------\n        |    |    |    |\n          |  cb |  cb |  cb\n        ---------------\n```\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: Each parent can produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 will have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n\nThus, the F2 population consists of four types of gametes:\n1. CB (25%)\n2. cb (25%)\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n- For C:\n  - Dominant (C): present \u2192 red\n  - Recessive (c): absent \u2192 plain\n- For B:\n  - Dominant (B): present \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive (b): absent \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of these. So, let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nThere are 16 possible combinations in the F2 (since 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nLet's count how many fall into each phenotype category:\n\n1. Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): Only the cases where C is dominant (i.e., Cc) and B is dominant (Bb). In the Punnett square, looking for cells where both C and B are present. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for a bird to have both dominant traits, they must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLooking at the F2:\n- Cc can lead to C (present) or c (absent)\n- Bb can lead to B (present) or b (absent)\n\nSo the combination where C is present and B is present results in Phenotype A (red and brown). The rest result in different phenotypes.\n\nCalculating the counts:\n- Phenotype A: (Number of Cc) * (Number of Bb) = (number of Cc) = 3/4 of the F2, similarly for Bb. But to get the exact numbers, let's see:\n  - Number of Cc: 12 (since 3/4 of 16 is 12)\n  - Number of Bb: 12\n  - Number of Cc \u00d7 Bb: 12 * 12 / 16 = 9? Wait, no\u2014this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let's use the fact that for each gene, the dominant and recessive counts are 12 and 4 respectively. So for Phenotype A, the number is (12/16) * (12/16) = (9/16) of the population. But that's not accurate because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes.\n\nAlternatively, the number of Phenotype A birds is the number of birds where both C and B are present, which is (number of Cc) * (number of Bb). But since Cc and Bb are independent, the probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16. So 9/16 of the F2 have both dominant traits.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype B (Red and checkered): This occurs when C is present (dominant) but B is absent (recessive). So, this requires that the bird has at least one C allele (so Cc or CC) and no B allele (so bb). The number of such birds is (number of CC + Cc) * (number of bb). \n\nFrom F2, the number of Cc is 12 (since 12 have at least one C), and the number of bb is 4. So Phenotype B is 12 * 4 = 48 birds.\n\nPhenotype C (Plain and brown): This occurs when neither C nor B is dominant. Wait, no\u2014plain is recessive for C, and brown is dominant for B. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So for Phenotype C, the bird must have no dominant alleles for either gene. That means:\n- c (recessive for C) and b (recessive for B) \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and checkered)\nBut wait, in reality, a bird can have no dominant alleles for one gene but still express a trait from the other. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is plain (no C), then it will have brown color regardless of B. Similarly, if it's brown (B present), it may be either plain or checkered depending on C. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype C is defined as \"plain and checkered\", which would require both C and B to be recessive (c and b). Because if either C or B is present, the corresponding trait is expressed. So Phenotype C is when both C and B are absent, leading to plain (no C) and checkered (no B). \n\nPhenotype D is when both C and B are present (red and brown), which is the opposite of Phenotype C.\n\nSo now, let's recalculate:\n\n- Phenotype A (both dominant): 9/16 of F2 \u2192 9\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): 4/16 of F2 \u2192 4\n- Phenotype C (neither dominant): 1/16 of F2 \u2192 1\n- Phenotype D (both dominant): 3/16 of F2 \u2192 3\n\nWait, adding up 9+4+1+3=17, which exceeds 16. So perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, the probability for each phenotype should sum to 1. Let me try again:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Phenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype C: Neither dominant \u2192 (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n- Phenotype D: Both recessive \u2192 (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the counts would be 9, 3, 1, 3 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match our calculations. Our calculation was:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype D): 3\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3\n- Plain red (phenotype A): 9\n- Plain brown (phenotype C): 1\n\nWhich matches option G. Option G states: 9, 3, 3, 1, which corresponds to checkered red (D), checkered brown (B), plain red (A), plain brown (C). So option G seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not considering the exact distribution. Maybe a better approach is to look at the possible combinations.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 combinations:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb (from F1 \u00d7 F1)\n\nThe Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          | B | b |\n        -----------------\n          |   |   | \n        | Cc | Cc |\n        -----------------\n      CB | B | b |\n        -----------------\n        cb | B | b |\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to represent the F2 as a grid where rows are one gene and columns are the other. So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Top row: CC (3/4), Cc (1/2), cc (1/4)\nFor the B locus:\n- Left column: BB (3/4), Bb (1/2), bb (1/4)\n\nNow, each cell represents the combination of alleles for each gene. The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can count the cells that fit each category. Let's go through each possibility:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present.\n- This happens when the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n- Looking at the Punnett square, the cells where both C and B are present are those where the C allele is present (CC or Cc) AND the B allele is present (BB or Bb).\n- From the Punnett square, the cells are:\n  - Cc \u00d7 Bb: All four cells are CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb?\nWait, no. Wait, the Punnett square for C and B would be a 2x2 grid, resulting in four cells. Each cell represents the combination of one allele from each parent.\n\nSo, for the C locus, the top row is CC, Cc, cc, and the B locus, left column is BB, Bb, bb.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n```\n          | B | b |\n        ---------------\n        |   |   |   |\n          | Cc | Cc | Cc\n        ---------------\n        |    |    |    |\n          |  CB |  cb |  cb\n        ---------------\n        |    |    |    |\n          |  cb |  cb |  cb\n        ---------------\n```\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: Each parent can produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 will have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n\nThus, the F2 population consists of four types of gametes:\n1. CB (25%)\n2. cb (25%)\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n- For C:\n  - Dominant (C): present \u2192 red\n  - Recessive (c): absent \u2192 plain\n- For B:\n  - Dominant (B): present \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive (b): absent \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of these. So, let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nThere are 16 possible combinations in the F2 (since 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nLet's count how many fall into each phenotype category:\n\n1. Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): Only the cases where C is dominant (i.e., Cc) and B is dominant (Bb). In the Punnett square, looking for cells where both C and B are present. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for a bird to have both dominant traits, they must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLooking at the F2:\n- Cc can lead to C (present) or c (absent)\n- Bb can lead to B (present) or b (absent)\n\nSo the combination where C is present and B is present results in Phenotype A (red and brown). The rest result in different phenotypes.\n\nCalculating the counts:\n- Phenotype A: (Number of Cc) * (Number of Bb) = (number of Cc) = 3/4 of the F2, similarly for Bb. But to get the exact numbers, let's see:\n  - Number of Cc: 12 (since 3/4 of 16 is 12)\n  - Number of Bb: 12\n  - Number of Cc \u00d7 Bb: 12 * 12 / 16 = 9? Wait, no\u2014this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let's use the fact that for each gene, the dominant and recessive counts are 12 and 4 respectively. So for Phenotype A, the number is (12/16) * (12/16) = (9/16) of the population. But that's not accurate because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes.\n\nAlternatively, the number of Phenotype A birds is the number of birds where both C and B are present, which is (number of Cc) * (number of Bb). But since Cc and Bb are independent, the probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16. So 9/16 of the F2 have both dominant traits.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype B (Red and checkered): This occurs when C is present (dominant) but B is absent (recessive). So, this requires that the bird has at least one C allele (so Cc or CC) and no B allele (so bb). The number of such birds is (number of CC + Cc) * (number of bb). \n\nFrom F2, the number of Cc is 12 (since 12 have at least one C), and the number of bb is 4. So Phenotype B is 12 * 4 = 48 birds.\n\nPhenotype C (Plain and brown): This occurs when neither C nor B is dominant. Wait, no\u2014plain is recessive for C, and brown is dominant for B. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So for Phenotype C, the bird must have no dominant alleles for either gene. That means:\n- c (recessive for C) and b (recessive for B) \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and checkered)\nBut wait, in reality, a bird can have no dominant alleles for one gene but still express a trait from the other. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is plain (no C), then it will have brown color regardless of B. Similarly, if it's brown (B present), it may be either plain or checkered depending on C. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype C is defined as \"plain and checkered\", which would require both C and B to be recessive (c and b). Because if either C or B is present, the corresponding trait is expressed. So Phenotype C is when both C and B are absent, leading to plain (no C) and checkered (no B). \n\nPhenotype D is when both C and B are present (red and brown), which is the opposite of Phenotype C.\n\nSo now, let's recalculate:\n\n- Phenotype A (both dominant): 9/16 of F2 \u2192 9\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): 4/16 of F2 \u2192 4\n- Phenotype C (neither dominant): 1/16 of F2 \u2192 1\n- Phenotype D (both dominant): 3/16 of F2 \u2192 3\n\nWait, adding up 9+4+1+3=17, which exceeds 16. So perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, the probability for each phenotype should sum to 1. Let me try again:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Phenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype C: Neither dominant \u2192 (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n- Phenotype D: Both recessive \u2192 (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the counts would be 9, 3, 1, 3 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match our calculations. Our calculation was:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype D): 3\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3\n- Plain red (phenotype A): 9\n- Plain brown (phenotype C): 1\n\nWhich matches option G. Option G states: 9, 3, 3, 1, which corresponds to checkered red (D), checkered brown (B), plain red (A), plain brown (C). So option G seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But this is not exactly correct because we need to consider the actual phenotypic expressions.",
    "rollout": " But this is not exactly correct because we need to consider the actual phenotypic expressions. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypic expression combines the presence of both dominant alleles. So the probability of a bird expressing both traits (Class A) is indeed (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of expressing only one trait is different. For instance, the probability of expressing only C (i.e., not B) is (prob C) * (prob not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. And similarly for only B. But wait, this seems off because in reality, the presence of C and B are independent, so the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C only): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (B only): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/16\n\nNow, each of these corresponds to a certain number of F2 birds. Assuming a population large enough, the expected ratios are proportional to these probabilities. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: 1 part\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.

But wait, this seems off because in reality, the presence of C and B are independent, so the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C only): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (B only): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/16\n\nNow, each of these corresponds to a certain number of F2 birds. Assuming a population large enough, the expected ratios are proportional to these probabilities. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: 1 part\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, that's not correct because the presence of C and B in the same bird is not multiplicative in terms of probabilities.",
    "rollout": " But wait, that's not correct because the presence of C and B in the same bird is not multiplicative in terms of probabilities. Instead, for each bird, the chance of both traits being present is the sum of the probabilities of each trait plus the probability of both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each trait is expressed. So the correct way is to look at each possible combination:\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented by the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering all possible combinations of the parent's alleles.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for the F2 generation, we can calculate the probabilities. The F2 generation will have the following genotypic distribution for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B are present \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nWait, no. That's not accurate because the presence of C and B are independent. The probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele in C is 75%, same for B. But the combined probability of having both dominant alleles is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%. Wait, but that's not exactly right because it's not simply multiplying the probabilities, because the events are not independent in the sense that one gene's presence affects the other. Wait, no\u2014they're independent because the genes are located far apart on the chromosome and assort independently during meiosis.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\nProbability of both C and B present \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nSimilarly,\nProbability of C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nProbability of C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nProbability of neither present \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nWhich simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, none directly match this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not correct because the presence of C and B in the same bird is not multiplicative in terms of probabilities. Instead, for each bird, the chance of both traits being present is the sum of the probabilities of each trait plus the probability of both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each trait is expressed. So the correct way is to look at each possible combination:\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented by the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering all possible combinations of the parent's alleles.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for the F2 generation, we can calculate the probabilities. The F2 generation will have the following genotypic distribution for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B are present \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nWait, no. That's not accurate because the presence of C and B are independent. The probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele in C is 75%, same for B. But the combined probability of having both dominant alleles is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%. Wait, but that's not exactly right because it's not simply multiplying the probabilities, because the events are not independent in the sense that one gene's presence affects the other. Wait, no\u2014they're independent because the genes are located far apart on the chromosome and assort independently during meiosis.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\nProbability of both C and B present \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nSimilarly,\nProbability of C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nProbability of C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nProbability of neither present \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nWhich simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, none directly match this.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of favorable outcomes over total. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\nTotal possible combinations for the two genes (assuming independence):\n\n- C C, C c, C c, c c for C locus\n- B B, B b, b b for B locus\n\nEach combination occurs with certain probabilities. For the F2 population, the number of each phenotype is:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): 9/16 (since 9 out of 16 combinations have both C and B)\nPhenotype B (C and b): 3/16\nPhenotype C (c and B): 3/16\nPhenotype D (c and b): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" Which matches our calculation. Option H says: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". That doesn't match. Other options don't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but that's not quite accurate because the presence of C and B are determined by the alleles, not by the probability directly.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but that's not quite accurate because the presence of C and B are determined by the alleles, not by the probability directly. Let me instead list the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThus, the F2 generation has a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A to D.\n\nNow, translating this back into the options given in the problem. The user lists several options, each with different ratios. Looking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems off because according to our calculation, checkered red is Phenotype D (plain and checkered), and plain red is Phenotype C (plain and brown). Wait, no\u2014let me clarify: From earlier, Phenotype A is red and brown, B is red and checkered, C is plain and brown, D is plain and checkered. So the correct order is: A (red and brown) : B (red and checkered) : C (plain and brown) : D (plain and checkered) with a ratio of 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypes are ordered as follows:\n\n1. Checkered red (D)\n2. Checkered brown (C)\n3. Plain red (B)\n4. Plain brown (A)\n\nWait, but looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply that checkered red is the most frequent, followed by plain red, then plain brown, then checkered brown. According to our calculation, the order should be A > B > C > D. So checkered red (A) is highest, then checkered brown (C), then plain red (B), then plain brown (D).\n\nLooking at the options, Option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite accurate because the presence of C and B are determined by the alleles, not by the probability directly. Let me instead list the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThus, the F2 generation has a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A to D.\n\nNow, translating this back into the options given in the problem. The user lists several options, each with different ratios. Looking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems off because according to our calculation, checkered red is Phenotype D (plain and checkered), and plain red is Phenotype C (plain and brown). Wait, no\u2014let me clarify: From earlier, Phenotype A is red and brown, B is red and checkered, C is plain and brown, D is plain and checkered. So the correct order is: A (red and brown) : B (red and checkered) : C (plain and brown) : D (plain and checkered) with a ratio of 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypes are ordered as follows:\n\n1. Checkered red (D)\n2. Checkered brown (C)\n3. Plain red (B)\n4. Plain brown (A)\n\nWait, but looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply that checkered red is the most frequent, followed by plain red, then plain brown, then checkered brown. According to our calculation, the order should be A > B > C > D. So checkered red (A) is highest, then checkered brown (C), then plain red (B), then plain brown (D).\n\nLooking at the options, Option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our order. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but that seems high.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, let's compute it directly by looking at the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized as:\n\n- CC BB (Phenotype A)\n- CC Bb (Phenotype B)\n- CC bb (Phenotype C)\n- Cc BB (Phenotype B)\n- Cc Bb (Phenotype D)\n- Cc bb (Phenotype C)\n- cc BB (Phenotype C)\n- cc Bb (Phenotype D)\n- cc bb (Phenotype D)\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC BB and CC Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cc BB and Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype C: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n\nTotal cases: 9, so probabilities are:\n\n- A: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- B: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- C: 3/9 = 33.3%\n- D: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 2 : 2 : 3 : 2, which corresponds to option E. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Incorrect.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Incorrect.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Wait, no, our counts were A:2, B:2, C:3, D:2 \u2192 Ratios would be 2:2:3:2, which is 2/9, 2/9, 3/9, 2/9, so option E says 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option C is 9,3,3,1 \u2192 also not matching. Option H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No. Option F is 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, which isn't the case here. Option G is 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Also wrong. Option I is 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not matching exactly. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is 16/9, but we have 9 birds. So none of the options seem to perfectly match except option E, but according to our calculations, the ratios are 2:2:3:2, which isn't listed. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the F2 birds:\n\nEach F2 bird can be represented as a combination of their genotypes for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- A: 1 bird\n- B: 2 birds (cases 2 and 4)\n- C: 3 birds (cases 3, 7, 8)\n- D: 3 birds (cases 5 and 9)\n\nWait, that sums up to 9 birds, with A:1, B:2, C:3, D:3. So the ratio is 1:2:3:3, which is not among the options. This suggests that either I made a mistake in the calculations or the options don't include the correct answer. Looking back, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment color (C): \n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- For body color (B): \n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. So the correct phenotypes are based on whether each gene has a dominant allele. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios should reflect the probabilities of each combination. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25% (Red pigment)\n- Cc: 50% (Pigeon)\n- cc: 25% (Plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: 25% (Brown body)\n- Bb: 50% (Brown body)\n- bb: 25% (Checkered body)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of these probabilities. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. The phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (Red and Brown)\n- C dominant, B recessive: 25% * 50% = 12.5% (Red and Checkered)\n- C recessive, B dominant: 50% * 25% = 12.5% (Plain and Brown)\n- Both recessive: 50% * 50% = 25% (Plain and Checkered)\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56%, which seems off because the sum should be 100%. Wait, no\u2014this approach treats the phenotypes as combinations of percentages, but the actual number of birds depends on the squares of the probabilities. Alternatively, it's easier to use the Punnett square to count the exact numbers. From earlier, we had:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 1 bird\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 2 birds\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 3 birds\n\nThis totals 9 birds. So the ratios are 1:2:3:3, which doesn't match any of the given options. But looking at the options, option E says 3:9:1:3, which is 3:9:1:3, meaning Phenotype C has 3, D has 1, which contradicts our previous count. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and the phenotypes are ordered differently. Maybe the order is Checkered first, then Brown, then Plain, etc. Let me try that.\n\nIf the phenotypes are ordered as Checkered (b), Brown (b), Plain (c), Red (c), then the counts would change. Let's recalculate:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain: CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014if the phenotypes are ordered as Checkered, Brown, Plain, Red, then the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain: CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nSo the ratio would be 3:3:2:2. Still not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are based on different assumptions. Looking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 Doesn't fit 9 birds.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal \u2192 No.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nNone of these add up to 9 birds. Perhaps the issue is that the F2 generation includes a double heterozygote, leading to different ratios. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question and the F2 refers to a different generation. Wait, the question says \"the F2 generation.\" Let me confirm the initial setup. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the selfed F1, which would indeed produce a F2 generation with 9 birds. So the correct ratios should be 1:2:3:3, which isn't listed. However, looking at option E: 3:9:1:3. Wait, that adds up to 16, which is too many. Option G is 12,2,2,0\u219216. Option F is 4,4,4,4\u219216. None matches 9 birds. This suggests that either I made a mistake in the calculations or the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but the prompt specifies F2. Alternatively, I may have miscalculated the phenotypic ratios. Let me try a different approach. The phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the probabilities of each gene. Since each gene is independent and follows a Mendelian ratio, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual gene ratios. For each gene, the probability of a dominant allele is higher than recessive, so the phenotypic ratios would be skewed towards the dominant forms. But without precise calculation, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a perfect match, I think the closest option is E: 3,9,1,3, but it sums to 16, which is problematic. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the F2 generation. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, so when selfing, the F2 should have the following probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypic ratios for each gene are 3:1 (Dominant:Recessive), but when combined, the overall ratio becomes more complex. However, the exact phenotypic ratio for F2 would require considering all combinations, which as previously determined, results in 1:2:3:3. Since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option E seems to have a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which might correspond to different scenarios. Alternatively, perhaps the question was asking for F1 instead of F2, but the prompt clearly states F2. At this point, I think I've exhausted my methods and conclude that none of the options match perfectly, but based on typical Mendelian ratios, the closest would be E: 3,9,1,3, though it sums to 16, which suggests a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should revisit the initial setup. Wait, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Then, F1 selfing yields F2 with the following genotypes: 25% CC BB, 50% Cc Bb, 25% cc bb. Translating to phenotypes: CC BB is both dominant, so Phenotype A. Cc Bb is mixed. cc bb is both recessive. So the phenotypic ratio is 1 (A) : 2 (B) : 3 (C) : 3 (D) \u2192 1:2:3:3. But this still doesn't match any options. Given the confusion, I might choose option E, despite it totaling 16 birds. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to a different scenario. Without further ado, I'll proceed with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, let's compute it directly by looking at the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized as:\n\n- CC BB (Phenotype A)\n- CC Bb (Phenotype B)\n- CC bb (Phenotype C)\n- Cc BB (Phenotype B)\n- Cc Bb (Phenotype D)\n- Cc bb (Phenotype C)\n- cc BB (Phenotype C)\n- cc Bb (Phenotype D)\n- cc bb (Phenotype D)\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC BB and CC Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cc BB and Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype C: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n\nTotal cases: 9, so probabilities are:\n\n- A: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- B: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- C: 3/9 = 33.3%\n- D: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 2 : 2 : 3 : 2, which corresponds to option E. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Incorrect.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Incorrect.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Wait, no, our counts were A:2, B:2, C:3, D:2 \u2192 Ratios would be 2:2:3:2, which is 2/9, 2/9, 3/9, 2/9, so option E says 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option C is 9,3,3,1 \u2192 also not matching. Option H is 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No. Option F is 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, which isn't the case here. Option G is 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Also wrong. Option I is 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not matching exactly. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is 16/9, but we have 9 birds. So none of the options seem to perfectly match except option E, but according to our calculations, the ratios are 2:2:3:2, which isn't listed. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the F2 birds:\n\nEach F2 bird can be represented as a combination of their genotypes for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- A: 1 bird\n- B: 2 birds (cases 2 and 4)\n- C: 3 birds (cases 3, 7, 8)\n- D: 3 birds (cases 5 and 9)\n\nWait, that sums up to 9 birds, with A:1, B:2, C:3, D:3. So the ratio is 1:2:3:3, which is not among the options. This suggests that either I made a mistake in the calculations or the options don't include the correct answer. Looking back, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment color (C): \n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- For body color (B): \n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. So the correct phenotypes are based on whether each gene has a dominant allele. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios should reflect the probabilities of each combination. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25% (Red pigment)\n- Cc: 50% (Pigeon)\n- cc: 25% (Plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: 25% (Brown body)\n- Bb: 50% (Brown body)\n- bb: 25% (Checkered body)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of these probabilities. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. The phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (Red and Brown)\n- C dominant, B recessive: 25% * 50% = 12.5% (Red and Checkered)\n- C recessive, B dominant: 50% * 25% = 12.5% (Plain and Brown)\n- Both recessive: 50% * 50% = 25% (Plain and Checkered)\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56%, which seems off because the sum should be 100%. Wait, no\u2014this approach treats the phenotypes as combinations of percentages, but the actual number of birds depends on the squares of the probabilities. Alternatively, it's easier to use the Punnett square to count the exact numbers. From earlier, we had:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 1 bird\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 2 birds\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 3 birds\n\nThis totals 9 birds. So the ratios are 1:2:3:3, which doesn't match any of the given options. But looking at the options, option E says 3:9:1:3, which is 3:9:1:3, meaning Phenotype C has 3, D has 1, which contradicts our previous count. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and the phenotypes are ordered differently. Maybe the order is Checkered first, then Brown, then Plain, etc. Let me try that.\n\nIf the phenotypes are ordered as Checkered (b), Brown (b), Plain (c), Red (c), then the counts would change. Let's recalculate:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain: CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014if the phenotypes are ordered as Checkered, Brown, Plain, Red, then the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain: CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nSo the ratio would be 3:3:2:2. Still not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are based on different assumptions. Looking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 Doesn't fit 9 birds.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal \u2192 No.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nNone of these add up to 9 birds. Perhaps the issue is that the F2 generation includes a double heterozygote, leading to different ratios. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question and the F2 refers to a different generation. Wait, the question says \"the F2 generation.\" Let me confirm the initial setup. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the selfed F1, which would indeed produce a F2 generation with 9 birds. So the correct ratios should be 1:2:3:3, which isn't listed. However, looking at option E: 3:9:1:3. Wait, that adds up to 16, which is too many. Option G is 12,2,2,0\u219216. Option F is 4,4,4,4\u219216. None matches 9 birds. This suggests that either I made a mistake in the calculations or the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but the prompt specifies F2. Alternatively, I may have miscalculated the phenotypic ratios. Let me try a different approach. The phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the probabilities of each gene. Since each gene is independent and follows a Mendelian ratio, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual gene ratios. For each gene, the probability of a dominant allele is higher than recessive, so the phenotypic ratios would be skewed towards the dominant forms. But without precise calculation, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a perfect match, I think the closest option is E: 3,9,1,3, but it sums to 16, which is problematic. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the F2 generation. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, so when selfing, the F2 should have the following probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypic ratios for each gene are 3:1 (Dominant:Recessive), but when combined, the overall ratio becomes more complex. However, the exact phenotypic ratio for F2 would require considering all combinations, which as previously determined, results in 1:2:3:3. Since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option E seems to have a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which might correspond to different scenarios. Alternatively, perhaps the question was asking for F1 instead of F2, but the prompt clearly states F2. At this point, I think I've exhausted my methods and conclude that none of the options match perfectly, but based on typical Mendelian ratios, the closest would be E: 3,9,1,3, though it sums to 16, which suggests a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should revisit the initial setup. Wait, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Then, F1 selfing yields F2 with the following genotypes: 25% CC BB, 50% Cc Bb, 25% cc bb. Translating to phenotypes: CC BB is both dominant, so Phenotype A. Cc Bb is mixed. cc bb is both recessive. So the phenotypic ratio is 1 (A) : 2 (B) : 3 (C) : 3 (D) \u2192 1:2:3:3. But this still doesn't match any options. Given the confusion, I might choose option E, despite it totaling 16 birds. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to a different scenario. Without further ado, I'll proceed with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, no\u2014because in reality, the presence of each gene is independent, so the combined probability is indeed 9/16.",
    "rollout": " But wait, no\u2014because in reality, the presence of each gene is independent, so the combined probability is indeed 9/16. Similarly, for each class:\n\nClass A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9/16 * 16 = 9 parts out of 16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 part out of 16.\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014because in reality, the presence of each gene is independent, so the combined probability is indeed 9/16. Similarly, for each class:\n\nClass A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9/16 * 16 = 9 parts out of 16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 part out of 16.\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding up to 16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because the presence of dominant alleles is what matters, not the recessive. So for each bird, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is:\n\nFor C: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\nSimilarly for B: 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\nSince the genes are independent, the probability that both are present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\nProbability of C present: 3/4\nProbability of B absent: 1/4 (since 1 - 3/4 = 1/4)\nCombined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\nProbability of C absent: 1/4\nProbability of B present: 3/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent.\nProbability of C absent: 1/4\nProbability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities for each class:\n- Class A: 9/16\n- Class B: 3/16\n- Class C: 3/16\n- Class D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio of phenotypes is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not exactly right because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the other gene is also present. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to count all possible combinations. Alternatively, considering that each bird has two independent traits, the number of possible phenotypic classes is 2 x 2 = 4. Each class corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n4. CC bb \u2192 Same as above? Wait, no\u2014actually, the F2 genotypes are: 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% CC bb, 25% CC bb, 25% Cc BB, 25% Cc Bb, 25% Cc bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb, 25% cc bb, etc.\u2014no, that's too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to realize that each trait is independent, so the phenotypic ratio is (prob C) * (prob B) for each combination. Let me try that.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each trait. For example:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when both C and B are present.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Since they're independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n- Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n- Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Occurs when neither C nor B is present.\n- Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding up all probabilities:\n\n9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, grouped as 9 (Red and Brown) : 3 (Red and Checkered) : 3 (Plain and Brown) : 1 (Plain and Checkered).\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2014 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2014 Also doesn't fit\nC. 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2014 No\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9 \u2014 Doesn't seem right\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2014 Not matching\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 All same, which isn't our ratio\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2014 Missing zero\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2014 Not matching\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2014 Not matching\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2014 Close but missing the exact ratio\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 Same as F\nL. 2, 8, 2, 2 \u2014 No\nM. 3, 6, 3, 0 \u2014 No\nN. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2014 No\nO. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 Same as F\nP. 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2014 No\nQ. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2014 No\nR. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 Same as F\nS. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2014 No\nT. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2014 No\nU. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2014 No\nV. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2014 No\nW. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2014 Yes!

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B present: 3/4 (similarly)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability that both are present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only C present (and B absent) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of having only B present (and C absent) is also (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of having neither present (both recessive) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A (both present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C present): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B present): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (none present): 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014that's not directly applicable. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the presence of C and B is determined by the genes, but each bird has two independent traits.",
    "rollout": " Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the presence of C and B is determined by the genes, but each bird has two independent traits. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present in the dominant form. So for each gene, the probability of the dominant form is:\n\nFor C: 1 (since any C gives red)\nFor B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n\nThus, the probability of having both traits (C and B present) is 1 * 1 = 1. But that can't be right because not all birds would have both traits. Wait, no\u2014it's not about the presence of both traits, but the expression of those traits. Since each bird has two traits, and each trait is expressed if the dominant allele is present, then all birds in this scenario will have both traits expressed. But that contradicts reality because some birds might lack one trait even if the other is present. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises when considering that each trait is expressed independently. For example, a bird may have C and not B, leading to red and plain, while another may have B and not C, leading to plain and brown, etc.\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the possible phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of the two traits. Since each trait is determined by one gene, the presence of the dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of each phenotype. For Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n\n- Probability of having C (dominant): 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of having B (dominant): 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Since these are independent, the combined probability is 1 * 1 = 1. But that seems wrong because it would imply that all birds have both traits, which isn't true. Wait, no\u2014it's correct because the presence of any dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So in reality, all birds will have both traits expressed, making Phenotype 1 the only possible outcome. But that can\u2019t be right because the options suggest multiple phenotypes. This indicates a misunderstanding. Let me reevaluate.\n\nAh, perhaps I've confused the traits. Each bird has two distinct traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The phenotype is a combination of both. So, for a bird to have both traits expressed, it must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and plain\n\nThe probability of each class is calculated by determining the likelihood of each trait being present or absent. For each trait, the presence is determined by the dominant allele. For pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): Probability = 1 (since C is always present in the offspring)\n- Absence (plain): Probability = 0\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): Probability = 1 (since B is always present)\n- Absence (checkered): Probability = 0\n\nSince the presence of each trait is certain (because both parents are homozygous and selfing), every bird in the F2 generation will express both traits, resulting in Phenotype 1 as the only possibility. However, this contradicts the given answer choices, indicating that there must be an error in my reasoning. Perhaps the assumption that both genes are dominant is incorrect, or the way the phenotypes are assigned is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try a different approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation, where each parent is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014parents are CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. So F1 is CcBB \u00d7 Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014they are CCBB (homozygous) and ccbb (homozygous recessive). So F1 is CcBb. Then F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Now, constructing the Punnett square for F2.\n\nThe possible gametes from Cc are CB and cb (each with 50% chance). Similarly, the possible gametes from Bb are Bb and bb (each with 50% chance). Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each gene is segregating independently. So for the C locus, each parent can produce gametes with C or c, and similarly for the B locus. So the F2 will have combinations of these gametes. The Punnett square will look like this:\n\n```\n          | C (50%) | c (50%) |\n        -------------------\n        CB       | CC (25%) | Cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cB       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces four gametes, so the Punnett square will be 16 cells. Let me correct that:\n\nEach parent can produce CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014gametes are C or c, B or b. So the possible F2 genotypes after combining all gametes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb? Wait, no\u2014the F2 is from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So the Punnett square will be:\n\n```\n          | C (50%) | c (50%) |\n        -------------------\n        CB       | CC (25%) | Cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cB       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n```\n\nWait, now compiling the frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since the F2 generation combines both loci, the phenotypes depend on both. So the phenotypic ratios can be determined by combining the probabilities of each trait. However, since each trait is determined by a separate gene, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait. Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously.\n\nLet me instead list all possible F2 genotypes and assign phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC (pigment red) and BB (body brown)\nPhenotype 2: CC (pigment red) and Bb (body brown)\nPhenotype 3: CC (pigment red) and bb (body checkered)\nPhenotype 4: Cc (pigment red) and BB (body brown)\nPhenotype 5: Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown)\nPhenotype 6: Cc (pigment red) and bb (body checkered)\nPhenotype 7: cc (pigment plain) and BB (body brown)\nPhenotype 8: cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown)\nPhenotype 9: cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered)\n\nNow, we need to count the number of each phenotype. However, without knowing the exact dominance relationships beyond what's stated, it's challenging. Assuming that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B.\n\nFrom the parents, C is dominant and B is dominant. Therefore, the presence of C or B determines the respective trait. So the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether each gene is present in the dominant form.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we can calculate the probabilities based on the Mendelian ratios. Since each gene is independent and follows a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each parent's gametes, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since we're looking at combined phenotypes, we need to account for the interactions between the two genes.\n\nHowever, considering that the presence of each dominant allele leads to the respective trait, the overall phenotypic ratio can be derived by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Each trait is expressed independently, so the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): Probability = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this can't be correct because it implies all birds have both traits)\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): Probability = 1 * 0 = 0\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): Probability = 0 * 1 = 0\n- Phenotype D (both C and B absent): Probability = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis again suggests that all birds would have both traits, which contradicts the given answer choices. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies in how the phenotypes are defined. Maybe the presence of dominant alleles leads to the opposite trait. For example:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 brown (b)\n- Pigment brown (B) \u2192 red (b)\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered (b)\n- Body checkered (b) \u2192 plain (B)\n\nIf that's the case, then the presence of dominant alleles leads to the opposite trait. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment checkered (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C: Pigment checkered and brown\n4. Pigment checkered (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D: Pigment checkered and checkered\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the opposite trait. So, the probabilities change accordingly.\n\nCalculating the phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 Pigment checkered and brown\n- Phenotype D: Both C and B absent \u2192 Pigment checkered and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: Probability of C present * Probability of B present = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Probability of C present * Probability of B absent = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Probability of C absent * Probability of B present = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Probability of C absent * Probability of B absent = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match 9:3:3:1.\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the presence of C and B is determined by the genes, but each bird has two independent traits. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present in the dominant form. So for each gene, the probability of the dominant form is:\n\nFor C: 1 (since any C gives red)\nFor B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n\nThus, the probability of having both traits (C and B present) is 1 * 1 = 1. But that can't be right because not all birds would have both traits. Wait, no\u2014it's not about the presence of both traits, but the expression of those traits. Since each bird has two traits, and each trait is expressed if the dominant allele is present, then all birds in this scenario will have both traits expressed. But that contradicts reality because some birds might lack one trait even if the other is present. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises when considering that each trait is expressed independently. For example, a bird may have C and not B, leading to red and plain, while another may have B and not C, leading to plain and brown, etc.\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the possible phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of the two traits. Since each trait is determined by one gene, the presence of the dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of each phenotype. For Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n\n- Probability of having C (dominant): 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of having B (dominant): 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Since these are independent, the combined probability is 1 * 1 = 1. But that seems wrong because it would imply that all birds have both traits, which isn't true. Wait, no\u2014it's correct because the presence of any dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So in reality, all birds will have both traits expressed, making Phenotype 1 the only possible outcome. But that can\u2019t be right because the options suggest multiple phenotypes. This indicates a misunderstanding. Let me reevaluate.\n\nAh, perhaps I've confused the traits. Each bird has two distinct traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The phenotype is a combination of both. So, for a bird to have both traits expressed, it must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and plain\n\nThe probability of each class is calculated by determining the likelihood of each trait being present or absent. For each trait, the presence is determined by the dominant allele. For pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): Probability = 1 (since C is always present in the offspring)\n- Absence (plain): Probability = 0\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): Probability = 1 (since B is always present)\n- Absence (checkered): Probability = 0\n\nSince the presence of each trait is certain (because both parents are homozygous and selfing), every bird in the F2 generation will express both traits, resulting in Phenotype 1 as the only possibility. However, this contradicts the given answer choices, indicating that there must be an error in my reasoning. Perhaps the assumption that both genes are dominant is incorrect, or the way the phenotypes are assigned is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try a different approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation, where each parent is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014parents are CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. So F1 is CcBB \u00d7 Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014they are CCBB (homozygous) and ccbb (homozygous recessive). So F1 is CcBb. Then F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Now, constructing the Punnett square for F2.\n\nThe possible gametes from Cc are CB and cb (each with 50% chance). Similarly, the possible gametes from Bb are Bb and bb (each with 50% chance). Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each gene is segregating independently. So for the C locus, each parent can produce gametes with C or c, and similarly for the B locus. So the F2 will have combinations of these gametes. The Punnett square will look like this:\n\n```\n          | C (50%) | c (50%) |\n        -------------------\n        CB       | CC (25%) | Cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cB       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces four gametes, so the Punnett square will be 16 cells. Let me correct that:\n\nEach parent can produce CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014gametes are C or c, B or b. So the possible F2 genotypes after combining all gametes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb? Wait, no\u2014the F2 is from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So the Punnett square will be:\n\n```\n          | C (50%) | c (50%) |\n        -------------------\n        CB       | CC (25%) | Cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cB       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n        cb       | Cc (25%) | cc (25%) |\n```\n\nWait, now compiling the frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since the F2 generation combines both loci, the phenotypes depend on both. So the phenotypic ratios can be determined by combining the probabilities of each trait. However, since each trait is determined by a separate gene, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait. Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously.\n\nLet me instead list all possible F2 genotypes and assign phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC (pigment red) and BB (body brown)\nPhenotype 2: CC (pigment red) and Bb (body brown)\nPhenotype 3: CC (pigment red) and bb (body checkered)\nPhenotype 4: Cc (pigment red) and BB (body brown)\nPhenotype 5: Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown)\nPhenotype 6: Cc (pigment red) and bb (body checkered)\nPhenotype 7: cc (pigment plain) and BB (body brown)\nPhenotype 8: cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown)\nPhenotype 9: cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered)\n\nNow, we need to count the number of each phenotype. However, without knowing the exact dominance relationships beyond what's stated, it's challenging. Assuming that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B.\n\nFrom the parents, C is dominant and B is dominant. Therefore, the presence of C or B determines the respective trait. So the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether each gene is present in the dominant form.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we can calculate the probabilities based on the Mendelian ratios. Since each gene is independent and follows a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each parent's gametes, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since we're looking at combined phenotypes, we need to account for the interactions between the two genes.\n\nHowever, considering that the presence of each dominant allele leads to the respective trait, the overall phenotypic ratio can be derived by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Each trait is expressed independently, so the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): Probability = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this can't be correct because it implies all birds have both traits)\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): Probability = 1 * 0 = 0\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): Probability = 0 * 1 = 0\n- Phenotype D (both C and B absent): Probability = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis again suggests that all birds would have both traits, which contradicts the given answer choices. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies in how the phenotypes are defined. Maybe the presence of dominant alleles leads to the opposite trait. For example:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 brown (b)\n- Pigment brown (B) \u2192 red (b)\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered (b)\n- Body checkered (b) \u2192 plain (B)\n\nIf that's the case, then the presence of dominant alleles leads to the opposite trait. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment checkered (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C: Pigment checkered and brown\n4. Pigment checkered (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D: Pigment checkered and checkered\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the opposite trait. So, the probabilities change accordingly.\n\nCalculating the phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 Pigment checkered and brown\n- Phenotype D: Both C and B absent \u2192 Pigment checkered and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: Probability of C present * Probability of B present = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Probability of C present * Probability of B absent = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Probability of C absent * Probability of B present = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Probability of C absent * Probability of B absent = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match 9:3:3:1.\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the presence of C and B is determined by their own genes, but in reality, the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other.",
    "rollout": " Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the presence of C and B is determined by their own genes, but in reality, the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead list all possible combinations of C and B and count their phenotypes.\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- C status: C (present) or c (absent)\n- B status: B (present) or b (absent)\n\nEach status is independent, so the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the presence of C and B is determined by their own genes, but in reality, the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead list all possible combinations of C and B and count their phenotypes.\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- C status: C (present) or c (absent)\n- B status: B (present) or b (absent)\n\nEach status is independent, so the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype. Since each parent is CcBb, the F2 generation will have a certain distribution. Using Mendel's laws, for each gene:\n\n- Number of C dominant (C_) = \u00be of the population\n- Number of B dominant (B_) = \u00be of the population\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability that both are dominant (Phenotype A) is (\u00be) * (\u00be) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (\u00be)(\u00bc) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (\u00bc)(\u00be) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (\u00bc)(\u00bc) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio of phenotypes in F2 is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, adding up to 16 parts. Wait, but looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, that's not accounting for the actual dominance. Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele ensures the trait is expressed. So the probability that a bird has both traits is indeed (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent. - Probability C present: 3/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4 (since 1/4 of the birds are bb)\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers for easier understanding: \n- Class A: 9/16 \u2248 9 (out of 16)\n- Class B: 3/16 \u2248 3\n- Class C: 3/16 \u2248 3\n- Class D: 1/16 \u2248 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. So Phenotype A: 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent. - Probability C present: 3/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4 (since 1/4 of the population has bb)\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nClass D: Both C and B absent. - Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, let's convert these fractions to ratios: 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16. Multiply all by 16 to eliminate denominators: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our calculations.\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4, doesn't fit.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nSo option C is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, for Class B: C present and B absent. Probability of C present: 3/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only 1/4 of the birds have bb). So combined: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Class C: C absent and B present. Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B present: 3/4. Combined: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Class D: Both C and B absent. Probability of C absent:1/4; B absent:1/4. Combined:1/16. Now, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nClass A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\nClass B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\nClass D:1/16\u21921 part\n\nTotal parts: 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which matches our calculation. Option H says 5,3,2,6\u2014doesn\u2019t match. Other options don't seem to align with this. So the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Class B: C present, B absent. - Probability of C present: 3/4. Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 75% B present, 25% B absent). So combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, Class C: C absent, B present. - Probability of C absent: 1/4. Probability of B present: 3/4. Combined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Class D: Neither C nor B present. - Probability of neither C nor B: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Now, converting these probabilities into ratios: 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 \u2192 Multiplying numerator by 16: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16. So the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nSo option C seems to fit our calculation. But let me double-check because sometimes problems can have different assumptions. Did I account for all possible phenotypes correctly? Yes, I think so. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not directly applicable because the phenotypic classes are determined by the combination of dominant traits. Alternatively, we can calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square for the F2:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (C)\n- 50% Cc (C)\n- 25% cc (c)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (B)\n- 50% Bb (B)\n- 25% bb (b)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of C and B. To find the proportion of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B present):\n- This happens when C is present (either CC or Cc) AND B is present (either BB or Bb).\n- Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent):\n- C present (3/4) AND B absent (25%)\n- Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present):\n- C absent (1/4) AND B present (3/4)\n- Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D (both C and B absent):\n- C absent (1/4) AND B absent (1/4)\n- Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts, assuming a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds (red and brown)\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds (red and checkered)\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds (plain and brown)\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird (plain and checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nHmm, option C seems to match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. But wait, the options don't include 9,3,3,1 directly except for option C. However, sometimes ratios are simplified differently, but in terms of counts, 9+3+3+1=16, which fits. So according to this, option C is correct. But let me double-check if I misapplied anything.\n\nWait, another thought: The F2 generation is being considered. In a typical dihybrid cross, the F1 is CcBb, and selfing yields F2 as described. So the calculations above seem correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. So Phenotype A: 9/16.\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since 25% bb)\nSo combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\nCombined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present.\n- Probability of neither C nor B present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, checking the options given:\n\nLooking back at the options, let me look through each choice:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9/16, which corresponds to red and brown (class A). Phenotype B is 3/16 (red and checkered), Phenotype C is 3/16 (plain and brown), and Phenotype D is 1/16 (plain and checkered).\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That seems different.\n\nOption E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which matches our calculation of 3:9:3:1, but that's not the case because our classes were 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014the actual counts are based on the number of individuals. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9,3,3,1. Looking back at the options, none directly match 9:3:3:1. Hmm, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16, but 6+2+6+2=16, but the distribution is unequal.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16, but B has zero.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Reverse order.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, reverse.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Not matching.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't add up.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nSo option C states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which aligns with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
