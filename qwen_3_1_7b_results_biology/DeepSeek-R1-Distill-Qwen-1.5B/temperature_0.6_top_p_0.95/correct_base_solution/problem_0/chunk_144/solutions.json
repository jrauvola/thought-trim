    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

Similarly, the probability of having only the first trait (C) is the probability of having C present times the probability of B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Same for the second trait: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And finally, the probability of having neither is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which sums to 16, so the fractions add up correctly.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4.",
    "rollout": " For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. Since the two genes are independent, the combined probability of having both dominant alleles (and thus expressing both traits) is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of having only one dominant allele is 2*(1/4)*(3/4) = 6/16. And the probability of having none is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 6/16\n- Phenotype C: 6/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are approximately 9:A :6:B :6:C :1:D.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because according to our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype D) is rare at 1/16, which is much less than what option E states.\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, our numbers don't align.\n\nLooking at Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't match either.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's 4:4:4:4, which adds up to 16. Our calculation shows a different distribution.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Checkered color is controlled by the recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by the dominant allele b.\nSo, in terms of expression, if an animal has a dominant allele for checkered (c), it's plain; if it has a dominant allele for brown (B), it's brown.\n\nSimilarly, if it has a dominant C allele, it's red; else, it's plain.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Because usually, the notation is that uppercase letters are dominant, lowercase are recessive. So:\n\n- Checkered color is c (recessive)\n- Plain color is B (dominant)\n\nThus, an animal is checkered if it has at least one 'c' allele (i.e., c^2 or cC), and plain if it has a dominant B allele (B^2 or Bb).\n\nSimilarly, pigment color: C is dominant (red), so animals are red if they have at least one C allele (C^2 or Cc), and plain if they have a recessive c allele (cc).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each bird is determined by both genes. So, for each bird, their phenotype is a combination of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment: Red if at least one C allele, else plain.\n- Body color: Checkered if at least one c allele, else brown.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Checkered (CR and BC)\n2. Pigment Red and Brown (CR and Bb)\n3. Plain and Checkered (cc and BC)\n4. Plain and Brown (cc and Bb)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each class.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of Pigment Red (at least one C): 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of Plain (cc): 1/4\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of Brown (at least one B): 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of Checkered (bb): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nClass 1: Pigment Red and Checkered\n\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass 2: Pigment Red and Brown\n\nProbability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nClass 3: Plain and Checkered\n\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nClass 4: Plain and Brown\n\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nNone of the options directly match this ratio. Wait, let's look again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios 3:9:1:3, which matches our calculation.\n\nYes! So the correct answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, checking option E:\n\nCheckered red: 3 parts\nCheckered brown: 9 parts\nPlain red: 1 part\nPlain brown: 3 parts\n\nTotal: 16 parts, which corresponds to the 3:9:1:3 ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. Since the two genes are independent, the combined probability of having both dominant alleles (and thus expressing both traits) is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of having only one dominant allele is 2*(1/4)*(3/4) = 6/16. And the probability of having none is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 6/16\n- Phenotype C: 6/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are approximately 9:A :6:B :6:C :1:D.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because according to our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype D) is rare at 1/16, which is much less than what option E states.\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, our numbers don't align.\n\nLooking at Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't match either.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's 4:4:4:4, which adds up to 16. Our calculation shows a different distribution.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Checkered color is controlled by the recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by the dominant allele b.\nSo, in terms of expression, if an animal has a dominant allele for checkered (c), it's plain; if it has a dominant allele for brown (B), it's brown.\n\nSimilarly, if it has a dominant C allele, it's red; else, it's plain.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Because usually, the notation is that uppercase letters are dominant, lowercase are recessive. So:\n\n- Checkered color is c (recessive)\n- Plain color is B (dominant)\n\nThus, an animal is checkered if it has at least one 'c' allele (i.e., c^2 or cC), and plain if it has a dominant B allele (B^2 or Bb).\n\nSimilarly, pigment color: C is dominant (red), so animals are red if they have at least one C allele (C^2 or Cc), and plain if they have a recessive c allele (cc).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each bird is determined by both genes. So, for each bird, their phenotype is a combination of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment: Red if at least one C allele, else plain.\n- Body color: Checkered if at least one c allele, else brown.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Checkered (CR and BC)\n2. Pigment Red and Brown (CR and Bb)\n3. Plain and Checkered (cc and BC)\n4. Plain and Brown (cc and Bb)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each class.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of Pigment Red (at least one C): 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of Plain (cc): 1/4\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of Brown (at least one B): 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of Checkered (bb): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nClass 1: Pigment Red and Checkered\n\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass 2: Pigment Red and Brown\n\nProbability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nClass 3: Plain and Checkered\n\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nClass 4: Plain and Brown\n\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nNone of the options directly match this ratio. Wait, let's look again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios 3:9:1:3, which matches our calculation.\n\nYes! So the correct answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, checking option E:\n\nCheckered red: 3 parts\nCheckered brown: 9 parts\nPlain red: 1 part\nPlain brown: 3 parts\n\nTotal: 16 parts, which corresponds to the 3:9:1:3 ratio. So option E is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc).",
    "rollout": " For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly, the chance of B present is 3/4. Assuming independence, the chance that both are present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The chance that C is present and B is not: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, the chance that C is not present and B is present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16. And the chance that neither is present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So now, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\nPhenotype A (both present): 9/16\nPhenotype B (C present, B not): 3/16\nPhenotype C (C not, B present): 3/16\nPhenotype D (neither present): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none directly match 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly, the chance of B present is 3/4. Assuming independence, the chance that both are present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The chance that C is present and B is not: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, the chance that C is not present and B is present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16. And the chance that neither is present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So now, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\nPhenotype A (both present): 9/16\nPhenotype B (C present, B not): 3/16\nPhenotype C (C not, B present): 3/16\nPhenotype D (neither present): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none directly match 9:3:3:1.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

So Phenotype D: 5th and 9th \u2192 2 instances?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype A occurs in cases where both C and B are present. Looking back:\n- Case 1: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n- Case 4: Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n- Case 7: cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n- Case 8: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\nSo that's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype B occurs when C is present, but B is absent:\n- Case 2: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\n- Case 5: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\nTotal: 2 cases.\n\nPhenotype C occurs when either C is absent (so it's plain) or B is absent (so it's brown), but not both.

But let's add up all instances: 4 (A) + 2 (B) + 3 (C) + 2 (D) = 11, but there are only 16 possible combinations. Wait, no\u2014actually, each bird has two traits, so each bird is categorized under exactly one phenotype. So the total should be 16, but our count adds up to 11. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the count. Let me list all nine F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5.

So the correct counts are:\n- A: 2\n- B: 1\n- C: 4\n- D: 2\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 2:A : 1:B : 4:C : 2:D \u2192 2:1:4:2, which simplifies to 1:0.5:2:1, but typically, ratios are expressed without fractions. Multiplying each by 2 gives 2:1:4:2. However, checking the options, none seem to match this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions A to J are various ratios. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't align with what I got. Option G was checkered red 12, etc. Option D had 1, 3, 9, 3, which seems off. Option E was 3,9,1,3. Option F was 4,4,4,4. Option I was 7,5,1,3. Option J was 2,6,3,1.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio is 2:1:4:2. This translates to 2 (A) : 1 (B) : 4 (C) : 2 (D). If I divide each by 2, it becomes 1:0.5:2:1, but that's not standard. Alternatively, expressing it as 2:1:4:2, the sum is 9 parts. So the phenotypic distribution is 2 (A), 1 (B), 4 (C), 2 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match. Option G is checkered red 12, etc. Not matching. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is different. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option F is 4,4,4,4. Option I is 7,5,1,3. Option J is 2,6,3,1. None of these seem to match my calculated ratio of 2:1:4:2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each bird is classified based on the presence of the dominant alleles, leading to four phenotypes. But perhaps the question expects the ratio based on the number of each phenotype multiplied by their occurrence in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When they self, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), CB (25%), BC (25%), BB (25%). From CB \u00d7 cb: CB (25%), Cb (25%), bc (25%), bb (25%). Similarly, from cb \u00d7 CB: same as CB \u00d7 cb. And from cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%), cb (25%), bc (25%), bb (25%).\n\nCombining all these, the F2 phenotypes can be mapped as follows:\n\nFor each bird:\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n- Cc \u2192 Red\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- cB \u2192 Red\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have the dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (Red Brown)\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (Red Checkered)\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain Checkered)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, mapping these to the four phenotypes:\n\n- A: CC \u00d7 BB, CC \u00d7 Bb, cc \u00d7 BB, cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Total 4 instances\n- B: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 1 instance\n- C: Cc \u00d7 BB, Cc \u00d7 Bb, Cc \u00d7 bb, cc \u00d7 BB, cc \u00d7 Bb, cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Total 6 instances\n- D: Cc \u00d7 Bb, cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that contradicts my previous count. Earlier, I thought there were 9 F2 individuals, but according to this, C is 6 and D is 2. Adding up: 4(A) +1(B)+6(C)+2(D)=13, which is more than 9. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let's list all nine F2 individuals properly:\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2\n- B: Case 2 \u2192 1\n- C: Cases 3,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- D: Cases 5,9 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 2+1+4+2=9, which checks out. So the correct counts are A:2, B:1, C:4, D:2. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 2:A : 1:B : 4:C : 2:D.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, none directly match this ratio. The closest is option H, which states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit. Option G is 12, 2, 4, 4, which is higher. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option F is 4,4,4,4. Option I is 7,5,1,3. Option J is 2,6,3,1.\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the 2:1:4:2 ratio. Perhaps the question expects the ratio in terms of raw counts before simplification. Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the question. Wait, going back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to my analysis, it's 2:1:4:2, which can be represented as 1:0.5:2:1 when divided by 2, but since ratios are usually expressed without fractions, perhaps it's 2:1:4:2. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. The user provided multiple-choice answers labeled A through J, but none seem to match the calculated ratio. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2:2\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3\n\nOption E:3:9:1:3\n\nOption F:4:4:4:4\n\nOption I:7:5:1:3\n\nOption J:2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, none seem to match 2:1:4:2. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic expression in terms of the presence of both traits, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me try a different approach using a Punnett square focusing solely on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The presence of C or B is necessary for the bird to exhibit the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the number of birds with both traits, only C, only B, or neither.\n\nUsing a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately:\n\n- For C (dominant), the possible phenotypes are: present (C) or not (c)\n- For B (dominant), the possible phenotypes are: present (B) or not (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Present C and Present B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Present C and Not B \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Not C and Present B \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Not C and Not B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the number of birds for each phenotype is:\n\n- A: All combinations except those with both C and B missing \u2192 which is 1/4 of the population (since 1/4 have cc and bb). So 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n- B: Only C present, B absent \u2192 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n- C: Only B present, C absent \u2192 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n- D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n\nWait, but this results in equal numbers for each phenotype, which is 4 each. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which matches option F. But according to my earlier calculation, this wasn't the case. What's the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because in reality, the presence of one dominant allele does not necessarily mean the other is present. For example, in the case of Cc, the individual may not express the B trait unless they have the B allele. So the presence of C (dominant) alone doesn't guarantee the B trait unless the individual is CB or Bb. Similarly, the presence of B alone doesn't guarantee the C trait unless they are CB or cc.\n\nWait, this complicates things because the actual phenotypic expression isn't simply the product of the probabilities for each gene, but rather requires considering the interaction between the two genes. Therefore, the initial approach of enumerating all possible F2 genotypes and mapping them to phenotypes is more accurate.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 2:A : 1:B : 4:C : 2:D, which doesn't match any of the answer options. However, looking back at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which assumes equal representation across all phenotypes, which isn't the case. Therefore, I must conclude that none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratio, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, rereading the question: \"the expected phenotypic ratio.\" The options suggest specific ratios. Among the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply that each phenotype is equally likely, but according to the F2 generation, the phenotypes are not equally probable due to the genetic interactions. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's not an option, I must reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the phenotypic ratio. Let me try another method. Using the principle of segregation and assuming independent genes, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering the combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nIn F2 generation, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Red and Brown (A)\n- Red and Checkered (B)\n- Plain and Brown (C)\n- Plain and Checkered (D)\n\nThe number of each phenotype is proportional to the squares of the phenotypic ratios of each gene. Wait, no\u2014that applies when each gene is segregating independently. Here, since the genes are linked, it's more complex. Alternatively, considering each bird's genotype and then translating to phenotype, as done earlier, the ratio is 2:1:4:2, which is approximately 1:0.5:2:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option H is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, which is twice the number of F2 individuals (which is 9). Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18. Option D is 1:3:9:3, summing to 16. Option E is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option I is 7:5:1:3, summing to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio expressed in terms of the presence of each trait. In that case, for each trait, the number of birds with that trait is calculated as follows:\n\n- Red: Phenotype A (both C and B present) plus Phenotype B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two genes. The number of phenotypic classes is 4, but each class corresponds to different combinations of dominant and recessive traits. The probabilities for each class can be calculated by considering all possible gamete combinations. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and map them to phenotypes:\n\nF2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (both C and B absent, so plain and checkered)\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C (since C is recessive)\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype C (since B is recessive)\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (both C and B recessive)\n\nNow, counting the occurrences for each phenotype:\n- Phenotype A: 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th \u2192 4 instances\n- Phenotype B: 2nd, 5th \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype C: 3rd, 6th, 9th \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype D: 5th, 9th \u2192 Wait, no, 5th is D, and 9th is also D. So Phenotype D: 5th and 9th \u2192 2 instances?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype A occurs in cases where both C and B are present. Looking back:\n- Case 1: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n- Case 4: Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n- Case 7: cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n- Case 8: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 A\nSo that's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype B occurs when C is present, but B is absent:\n- Case 2: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\n- Case 5: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\nTotal: 2 cases.\n\nPhenotype C occurs when either C is absent (so it's plain) or B is absent (so it's brown), but not both. Wait, looking at the F2:\n- Cases 3: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n- Case 6: Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n- Case 9: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\nSo that's 3 cases.\n- Cases 5: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 D\n- Cases 9: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\nSo that's 2 cases.\n\nPhenotype D occurs when both C and B are absent:\n- Cases 5: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 D\n- Case 9: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\nThat's 2 cases.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 3 instances for C and 2 for D, but according to the counts above, C is 3 and D is 2. But let's add up all instances: 4 (A) + 2 (B) + 3 (C) + 2 (D) = 11, but there are only 16 possible combinations. Wait, no\u2014actually, each bird has two traits, so each bird is categorized under exactly one phenotype. So the total should be 16, but our count adds up to 11. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's consider all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (Red Brown)\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (Red Checkered)\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (Red Brown)\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain Checkered)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain Checkered)\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Occurs in cases 1, 4, 7, 8 \u2192 4 times\n- Phenotype B: Occurs in case 2 \u2192 1 time\n- Phenotype C: Occurs in cases 3, 6, 9 \u2192 3 times\n- Phenotype D: Occurs in cases 5, 10 \u2192 2 times\n\nWait, but case 10 doesn't exist because there are only nine possible F2 individuals. So perhaps I made a mistake in the count. Let me list all nine F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- A: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 instances\n- B: Case 2 \u2192 1 instance\n- C: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4 instances\n- D: Cases 5, 9 \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, now that makes sense because 2+1+4+2=9. So the correct counts are:\n- A: 2\n- B: 1\n- C: 4\n- D: 2\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 2:A : 1:B : 4:C : 2:D \u2192 2:1:4:2, which simplifies to 1:0.5:2:1, but typically, ratios are expressed without fractions. Multiplying each by 2 gives 2:1:4:2. However, checking the options, none seem to match this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions A to J are various ratios. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't align with what I got. Option G was checkered red 12, etc. Option D had 1, 3, 9, 3, which seems off. Option E was 3,9,1,3. Option F was 4,4,4,4. Option I was 7,5,1,3. Option J was 2,6,3,1.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio is 2:1:4:2. This translates to 2 (A) : 1 (B) : 4 (C) : 2 (D). If I divide each by 2, it becomes 1:0.5:2:1, but that's not standard. Alternatively, expressing it as 2:1:4:2, the sum is 9 parts. So the phenotypic distribution is 2 (A), 1 (B), 4 (C), 2 (D).\n\nLooking at the options, option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match. Option G is checkered red 12, etc. Not matching. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is different. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option F is 4,4,4,4. Option I is 7,5,1,3. Option J is 2,6,3,1. None of these seem to match my calculated ratio of 2:1:4:2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each bird is classified based on the presence of the dominant alleles, leading to four phenotypes. But perhaps the question expects the ratio based on the number of each phenotype multiplied by their occurrence in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When they self, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), CB (25%), BC (25%), BB (25%). From CB \u00d7 cb: CB (25%), Cb (25%), bc (25%), bb (25%). Similarly, from cb \u00d7 CB: same as CB \u00d7 cb. And from cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%), cb (25%), bc (25%), bb (25%).\n\nCombining all these, the F2 phenotypes can be mapped as follows:\n\nFor each bird:\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n- Cc \u2192 Red\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- cB \u2192 Red\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have the dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A (Red Brown)\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (Red Checkered)\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain Checkered)\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, mapping these to the four phenotypes:\n\n- A: CC \u00d7 BB, CC \u00d7 Bb, cc \u00d7 BB, cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Total 4 instances\n- B: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 1 instance\n- C: Cc \u00d7 BB, Cc \u00d7 Bb, Cc \u00d7 bb, cc \u00d7 BB, cc \u00d7 Bb, cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Total 6 instances\n- D: Cc \u00d7 Bb, cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that contradicts my previous count. Earlier, I thought there were 9 F2 individuals, but according to this, C is 6 and D is 2. Adding up: 4(A) +1(B)+6(C)+2(D)=13, which is more than 9. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let's list all nine F2 individuals properly:\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 C\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 C\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2\n- B: Case 2 \u2192 1\n- C: Cases 3,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- D: Cases 5,9 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 2+1+4+2=9, which checks out. So the correct counts are A:2, B:1, C:4, D:2. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 2:A : 1:B : 4:C : 2:D.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, none directly match this ratio. The closest is option H, which states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit. Option G is 12, 2, 4, 4, which is higher. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option F is 4,4,4,4. Option I is 7,5,1,3. Option J is 2,6,3,1.\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the 2:1:4:2 ratio. Perhaps the question expects the ratio in terms of raw counts before simplification. Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the question. Wait, going back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to my analysis, it's 2:1:4:2, which can be represented as 1:0.5:2:1 when divided by 2, but since ratios are usually expressed without fractions, perhaps it's 2:1:4:2. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. The user provided multiple-choice answers labeled A through J, but none seem to match the calculated ratio. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2:2\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3\n\nOption E:3:9:1:3\n\nOption F:4:4:4:4\n\nOption I:7:5:1:3\n\nOption J:2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, none seem to match 2:1:4:2. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic expression in terms of the presence of both traits, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me try a different approach using a Punnett square focusing solely on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The presence of C or B is necessary for the bird to exhibit the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the number of birds with both traits, only C, only B, or neither.\n\nUsing a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately:\n\n- For C (dominant), the possible phenotypes are: present (C) or not (c)\n- For B (dominant), the possible phenotypes are: present (B) or not (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Present C and Present B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Present C and Not B \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Not C and Present B \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Not C and Not B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the number of birds for each phenotype is:\n\n- A: All combinations except those with both C and B missing \u2192 which is 1/4 of the population (since 1/4 have cc and bb). So 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n- B: Only C present, B absent \u2192 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n- C: Only B present, C absent \u2192 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n- D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 of 16 is 4 birds.\n\nWait, but this results in equal numbers for each phenotype, which is 4 each. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which matches option F. But according to my earlier calculation, this wasn't the case. What's the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because in reality, the presence of one dominant allele does not necessarily mean the other is present. For example, in the case of Cc, the individual may not express the B trait unless they have the B allele. So the presence of C (dominant) alone doesn't guarantee the B trait unless the individual is CB or Bb. Similarly, the presence of B alone doesn't guarantee the C trait unless they are CB or cc.\n\nWait, this complicates things because the actual phenotypic expression isn't simply the product of the probabilities for each gene, but rather requires considering the interaction between the two genes. Therefore, the initial approach of enumerating all possible F2 genotypes and mapping them to phenotypes is more accurate.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 2:A : 1:B : 4:C : 2:D, which doesn't match any of the answer options. However, looking back at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which assumes equal representation across all phenotypes, which isn't the case. Therefore, I must conclude that none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratio, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, rereading the question: \"the expected phenotypic ratio.\" The options suggest specific ratios. Among the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply that each phenotype is equally likely, but according to the F2 generation, the phenotypes are not equally probable due to the genetic interactions. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's not an option, I must reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the phenotypic ratio. Let me try another method. Using the principle of segregation and assuming independent genes, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering the combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nIn F2 generation, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Red and Brown (A)\n- Red and Checkered (B)\n- Plain and Brown (C)\n- Plain and Checkered (D)\n\nThe number of each phenotype is proportional to the squares of the phenotypic ratios of each gene. Wait, no\u2014that applies when each gene is segregating independently. Here, since the genes are linked, it's more complex. Alternatively, considering each bird's genotype and then translating to phenotype, as done earlier, the ratio is 2:1:4:2, which is approximately 1:0.5:2:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option H is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, which is twice the number of F2 individuals (which is 9). Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18. Option D is 1:3:9:3, summing to 16. Option E is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option I is 7:5:1:3, summing to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio expressed in terms of the presence of each trait. In that case, for each trait, the number of birds with that trait is calculated as follows:\n\n- Red: Phenotype A (both C and B present) plus Phenotype B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each bird's phenotype can be categorized by whether each trait is present.",
    "rollout": " Each bird's phenotype can be categorized by whether each trait is present. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, totaling 16 parts. But looking back at the options given, none directly match this ratio. Wait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions include numbers like 6, 8, 12, etc. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Each bird has two independent traits, so the chance of each trait being present is:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- 100% if the bird has at least one C allele.\n- 0% if all are c.\n\nSimilarly for body color (B):\n- 100% if at least one B allele.\n- 0% if all are b.\n\nThus, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 1 * 1 = 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 1 * 0 = 0\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Neither present \u2192 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because then all birds would have both traits, which contradicts our earlier analysis. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Instead of calculating probabilities based on the number of ways, perhaps I should list all possible phenotypes in the F2 generation and count them. \n\nIn F2, each bird inherits two alleles for each gene from the F1 (CcBb). Since each gene is segregating independently, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nThe phenotype of a bird is determined by both genes. So, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (red) and B is present (brown), phenotype is red and brown.\n- If C is present (red) and B is absent (checkered), phenotype is red and checkered.\n- If C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown), phenotype is plain and brown.\n- If C is absent (plain) and B is absent (checkered), phenotype is plain and checkered.\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype in F2, let's calculate:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals: Let's assume each gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the segregation is Mendelian. Since each gene has four possible phenotypes, but combined, the phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but that seems similar to what I thought before. Let me double-check. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio in F2 would be 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts red and brown, 3 parts red and checkered, 3 parts plain and brown, and 1 part plain and checkered.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype can be categorized by whether each trait is present. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, totaling 16 parts. But looking back at the options given, none directly match this ratio. Wait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions include numbers like 6, 8, 12, etc. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Each bird has two independent traits, so the chance of each trait being present is:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- 100% if the bird has at least one C allele.\n- 0% if all are c.\n\nSimilarly for body color (B):\n- 100% if at least one B allele.\n- 0% if all are b.\n\nThus, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 1 * 1 = 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 1 * 0 = 0\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Neither present \u2192 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because then all birds would have both traits, which contradicts our earlier analysis. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Instead of calculating probabilities based on the number of ways, perhaps I should list all possible phenotypes in the F2 generation and count them. \n\nIn F2, each bird inherits two alleles for each gene from the F1 (CcBb). Since each gene is segregating independently, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nThe phenotype of a bird is determined by both genes. So, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (red) and B is present (brown), phenotype is red and brown.\n- If C is present (red) and B is absent (checkered), phenotype is red and checkered.\n- If C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown), phenotype is plain and brown.\n- If C is absent (plain) and B is absent (checkered), phenotype is plain and checkered.\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype in F2, let's calculate:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals: Let's assume each gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the segregation is Mendelian. Since each gene has four possible phenotypes, but combined, the phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but that seems similar to what I thought before. Let me double-check. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio in F2 would be 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts red and brown, 3 parts red and checkered, 3 parts plain and brown, and 1 part plain and checkered. But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nOption C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options are presented as counts without specifying order. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nHowever, I recall that sometimes the order can vary depending on the traits. In this case, red and brown come from C and B, respectively. So, the ratio would be:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9\n- Red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nYes, that adds up to 16 birds. But the options don't specify the order beyond the counts. So the correct answer should reflect this ratio. Looking back at the options, option C states 9, 3, 3, 1, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of looking at each gene separately, let's list all possible phenotypes and their counts:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals: 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and there are two independent genes).\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Counts: 9 (since 3/4 C and 3/4 B \u2192 3*3=9)\nPhenotype B: Only C present \u2192 3 (3 C and 0 B)\nPhenotype C: Only B present \u2192 3 (0 C and 3 B)\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 1 (0 C and 0 B)\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, converting these numbers into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 of the population\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That's 16 total, which matches our calculation, but the ratios don't align with what we derived.\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:",
    "rollout": " For each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:\n\nFor C:\n- Dominant: C (either C C or C c) \u2192 3/4\n- Recessive: cc \u2192 1/4\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Dominant: B (either B B or B b) \u2192 3/4\n- Recessive: bb \u2192 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability that both are dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability that only C is dominant (B recessive) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Similarly, only B is dominant (C recessive) is also 3/16. Finally, neither is dominant (both recessive) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nA: 9/16 (red and brown)\nB: 3/16 (red and checkered)\nC: 3/16 (plain and brown)\nD: 1/16 (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this distribution. However, the options given are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC.

Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match our calculation of 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. This suggests that either I've made a mistake in calculations or the options are presented differently.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I interpreted the genes correctly. The user mentioned:\n\n- Gene C: pigment color (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain)\n- Gene B: color (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits based on the presence of dominant alleles. From the Punnett square analysis, the expected phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9/16: Both C and B present (red and brown)\n- 3/16: Only C present (red and checkered)\n- 3/16: Only B present (plain and brown)\n- 1/16: Neither present (plain and checkered)\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which corresponds to 12:2:2:0, which is different from what I derived. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is also different. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but flipped.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the ratio of checkered vs. plain and similarly for brown vs. red, instead of the overall phenotypic ratio. Let me read the question again: \"show the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2...\" So perhaps they want the ratio within each phenotype category compared to others, not the overall.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 6\n- Plain brown: 2\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nThe ratio would be 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype type, not the ratio. Looking back:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\nThis seems to be a count of each phenotype, not a ratio. So in this case, the answer would be option A, as it states the counts for each phenotype.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. If it's referring to the ratio among all phenotypes, then it's 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. If it's referring to the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, then it's 9:3:3:1 over 16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this, except perhaps none of them do. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated something else.\n\nWait, going back: the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). They produce gametes CB and cb in equal numbers (25% each). Their F1 would be CcBb, which when crossed would produce F2. The F2 would have 16 individuals. Using the Punnett square method, the expected phenotypes would be:\n\n- 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n  - 9/16 have both C and B (red and brown)\n  - 3/16 have C but not B (red and checkered)\n  - 3/16 have B but not C (plain and brown)\n  - 1/16 have neither (plain and checkered)\n\nSo converting to counts:\n\n- 9: 9 birds with both traits\n- 3: 3 birds with only C\n- 3: 3 birds with only B\n- 1: 1 bird with neither\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly correspond. However, option G mentions 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown, which sums to 16. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nOption H is 5:3:2:6, which adds up to 16, but again, not matching our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption I is 7:5:1:3, which also adds to 16, but no match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the number of each trait, not the combined. For instance, for each phenotype, how many are there:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16 \u2192 9\nCheckered brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\nPlain red: 3/16 \u2192 3\nPlain brown: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nBut none of the options match this exact count. However, option G lists 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is also different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype, grouped together. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\nTotal: 16\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options provide this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype group relative to the next, such as checkered red to checkered brown, plain red to plain brown, etc.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Checkered red : Checkered brown = 9:3 = 3:1\n- Plain red : Plain brown = 3:1\n\nBut none of the options reflect this grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, without considering the overall population. For example, in the F2 generation, how many have each phenotype?\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. As calculated earlier, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. So if the question is asking for this ratio, none of the options match exactly. However, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio in terms of the F2 generation's breakdown into each phenotype, which would be 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them list this exactly. However, option G provides 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct answer isn't listed. But since the task is to choose from the given options, I'll have to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me recount the F2 generation:\n\nEach parent (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb) produces gametes CB and cb. F1 is CcBb. F2 is formed by F1 \u00d7 F1. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n----------|---|---\n        C | CC | Cc\n----------|---|---\n        B | CB | Bb\n----------|---|---\n        b | cB | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect. The F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB or cb. So the Punnett square should be:\n\n```\n           | C | c\n----------|---|---\n        C | CC | Cc\n----------|---|---\n        B | CB | Bb\n----------|---|---\n        b | cB | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F2 will have:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigment red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the F2 will have:\n\n- Checkered red: both recessive alleles present (cc and bb) \u2192 1/16 of the population\n- Checkered brown: B present, cc absent \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: C present, B present \u2192 9/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nNone of the options match this exactly. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, grouped by each trait separately. For example, how many have both traits, how many have only one, etc. In that case:\n\n- Both C and B: 9\n- C only: 3\n- B only: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nWhich totals 16. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the closest is option G, which lists 12:2:2:0, but that doesn't add up to 16. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible gamete combinations, leading to a different phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, maybe the user meant to include only certain phenotypes. Without further clarity, it's challenging to select the correct option. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which lists 12:2:2:0, but that seems incorrect.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:\n\nFor C:\n- Dominant: C (either C C or C c) \u2192 3/4\n- Recessive: cc \u2192 1/4\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Dominant: B (either B B or B b) \u2192 3/4\n- Recessive: bb \u2192 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability that both are dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability that only C is dominant (B recessive) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Similarly, only B is dominant (C recessive) is also 3/16. Finally, neither is dominant (both recessive) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nA: 9/16 (red and brown)\nB: 3/16 (red and checkered)\nC: 3/16 (plain and brown)\nD: 1/16 (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this distribution. However, the options given are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE.

Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match our calculation of 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. This suggests that either I've made a mistake in calculations or the options are presented differently.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I interpreted the genes correctly. The user mentioned:\n\n- Gene C: pigment color (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain)\n- Gene B: color (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits based on the presence of dominant alleles. From the Punnett square analysis, the expected phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9/16: Both C and B present (red and brown)\n- 3/16: Only C present (red and checkered)\n- 3/16: Only B present (plain and brown)\n- 1/16: Neither present (plain and checkered)\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which corresponds to 12:2:2:0, which is different from what I derived. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is also different. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but flipped.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the ratio of checkered vs. plain and similarly for brown vs. red, instead of the overall phenotypic ratio. Let me read the question again: \"show the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2...\" So perhaps they want the ratio within each phenotype category compared to others, not the overall.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 6\n- Plain brown: 2\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nThe ratio would be 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype type, not the ratio. Looking back:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\nThis seems to be a count of each phenotype, not a ratio. So in this case, the answer would be option A, as it states the counts for each phenotype.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. If it's referring to the ratio among all phenotypes, then it's 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. If it's referring to the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, then it's 9:3:3:1 over 16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this, except perhaps none of them do. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated something else.\n\nWait, going back: the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). They produce gametes CB and cb in equal numbers (25% each). Their F1 would be CcBb, which when crossed would produce F2. The F2 would have 16 individuals. Using the Punnett square method, the expected phenotypes would be:\n\n- 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n  - 9/16 have both C and B (red and brown)\n  - 3/16 have C but not B (red and checkered)\n  - 3/16 have B but not C (plain and brown)\n  - 1/16 have neither (plain and checkered)\n\nSo converting to counts:\n\n- 9: 9 birds with both traits\n- 3: 3 birds with only C\n- 3: 3 birds with only B\n- 1: 1 bird with neither\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly correspond. However, option G mentions 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown, which sums to 16. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nOption H is 5:3:2:6, which adds up to 16, but again, not matching our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption I is 7:5:1:3, which also adds to 16, but no match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the number of each trait, not the combined. For instance, for each phenotype, how many are there:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16 \u2192 9\nCheckered brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\nPlain red: 3/16 \u2192 3\nPlain brown: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nBut none of the options match this exact count. However, option G lists 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is also different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype, grouped together. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\nTotal: 16\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options provide this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype group relative to the next, such as checkered red to checkered brown, plain red to plain brown, etc.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Checkered red : Checkered brown = 9:3 = 3:1\n- Plain red : Plain brown = 3:1\n\nBut none of the options reflect this grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, without considering the overall population. For example, in the F2 generation, how many have each phenotype?\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. As calculated earlier, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. So if the question is asking for this ratio, none of the options match exactly. However, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio in terms of the F2 generation's breakdown into each phenotype, which would be 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them list this exactly. However, option G provides 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct answer isn't listed. But since the task is to choose from the given options, I'll have to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me recount the F2 generation:\n\nEach parent (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb) produces gametes CB and cb. F1 is CcBb. F2 is formed by F1 \u00d7 F1. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n----------|---|---\n        C | CC | Cc\n----------|---|---\n        B | CB | Bb\n----------|---|---\n        b | cB | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect. The F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB or cb. So the Punnett square should be:\n\n```\n           | C | c\n----------|---|---\n        C | CC | Cc\n----------|---|---\n        B | CB | Bb\n----------|---|---\n        b | cB | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F2 will have:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigment red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the F2 will have:\n\n- Checkered red: both recessive alleles present (cc and bb) \u2192 1/16 of the population\n- Checkered brown: B present, cc absent \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: C present, B present \u2192 9/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nNone of the options match this exactly. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, grouped by each trait separately. For example, how many have both traits, how many have only one, etc. In that case:\n\n- Both C and B: 9\n- C only: 3\n- B only: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nWhich totals 16. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the closest is option G, which lists 12:2:2:0, but that doesn't add up to 16. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible gamete combinations, leading to a different phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, maybe the user meant to include only certain phenotypes. Without further clarity, it's challenging to select the correct option. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which lists 12:2:2:0, but that seems incorrect.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

So:\n\n- For the C locus: 3/4 chance of C present, 1/4 chance of c present.\n- For the B locus: 3/4 chance of B present, 1/4 chance of b present.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios relative to the others:\n\nTotal Phenotype A: 9 parts\nPhenotype B: 3 parts\nPhenotype C: 3 parts\nPhenotype D: 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, but we need to convert this to the total number of phenotypes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of both genes. So:\n\n- For the C locus: 3/4 chance of C present, 1/4 chance of c present.\n- For the B locus: 3/4 chance of B present, 1/4 chance of b present.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios relative to the others:\n\nTotal Phenotype A: 9 parts\nPhenotype B: 3 parts\nPhenotype C: 3 parts\nPhenotype D: 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, but we need to convert this to the total number of phenotypes. Let's add up all the parts: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts total. So the ratio becomes:\n\n9:3:3:1\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to Phenotype A (red and brown) : Phenotype B (red and checkered) : Phenotype C (plain and brown) : Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nLooking back at the options given, let me see which one matches this ratio. Option J says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Hmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014the calculations seem correct. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- C only: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- B only: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Phenotype A, B, C, D respectively. None of the answer choices directly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No, missing 6 and 2.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! This matches exactly what I got.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1 except option C. However, looking back, I realize that the F2 generation phenotypic ratio in the standard dihybrid cross for two linked genes typically results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which matches what I've calculated. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible combinations is 4, each with different probabilities. To find the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): This happens when C is present and B is present. The probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n- Phenotype B (only C present, B absent): This is when C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). So (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n- Phenotype C (only B present, C absent): Similarly, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n- Phenotype D (neither present): (1/4)^2=1/16.\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Summing up, the total is 16 parts. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Opposite of what we expect.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, opposite.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 All four phenotypes equally represented, which isn't the case here.\nG.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each trait, the probability of the trait being present is 3/4 (for C) and 3/4 for B. But the combined probability is the product of each trait's probability, but since the presence of each trait is independent, the probability of both traits being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of only C (and not B) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Same for only B. And none is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. The number of possible phenotypes is 4 (as above). The distribution of these phenotypes in the F2 can be calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio can be derived by squaring the ratios for each gene. Wait, no\u2014that's not exactly right. For each gene, the ratio is 3:1 (dominant : recessive). But since we're looking at two traits, each determined by one gene, the combined ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So for each trait, the probability of presence is 3/4, and non-present is 1/4. Since the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9/16 have both traits, 3/16 have only C, 3/16 have only B, and 1/16 have neither.\n\nNow, applying this to the problem. The options given are A through J, each providing different phenotypic ratios. Let's look at option G: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" This matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible phenotypes is 4. Each phenotype corresponds to a combination of dominant and recessive traits for each gene. The probability for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having both C and B dominant (phenotype 1) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThe probability of having only C dominant (and B recessive) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only B dominant (and C recessive) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of having neither dominant (both recessive) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, they seem to list phenotypic ratios among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. Wait, no\u2014the options are showing different ratios. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions A-F:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio in terms of checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, without grouping. But the options don't include such a comprehensive breakdown. Maybe I misinterpreted the question.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" And the options are giving various counts for each phenotype category.\n\nSo perhaps the user wants the count of each phenotype in the F2 generation. My earlier calculation suggested that in F2, the phenotypic distribution is approximately 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, totaling 16. But none of the options match exactly. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try again. The F2 generation is produced by F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene is independently assorting, so the probabilities for each gene in the F2 are:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 3/4 chance of C present.\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 3/4 chance of B present.\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability of both traits appearing (i.e., C and B present) is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, and neither is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9 parts (checkered red)\n- Only C present: 3 parts (checkered brown)\n- Only B present: 3 parts (plain red)\n- Neither present: 1 part (plain brown)\n\nTherefore, the total ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to option G. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of adding probabilities, it's better to list the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their C and B alleles. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene, so for CC BB, C is dominant, so it's red, and B is dominant, so brown.\n\nWait, perhaps a table would help. Let me create a Punnett square for the F2 generation considering both genes.\n\nThe F2 for the C locus and B locus are each independent, so we can represent the possible combinations as a grid.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the phenotypic classes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 A (red, brown)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 B (red, checkered)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 C (plain, brown)\n4. Neither present \u2192 D (plain, checkered)\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each combination:\n\nFor A:\n- Probability C is present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one C allele)\n- Probability B is present: 3/4\n- So combined probability: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nFor B:\n- Probability C is present: 3/4\n- Probability B absent (i.e., B is recessive): 1/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nFor C:\n- Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nFor D:\n- Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA: 9/16\n\nB: 3/16\n\nC: 3/16\n\nD: 1/16\n\nAdding up these fractions: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Not matching our calculation.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches exactly with what we calculated (9+3+3+1=16).\nD.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But the presence of the dominant allele in each gene affects the trait. So for a bird to have both traits, both C and B must be present. The probability of having at least one dominant allele in C is 3/4, same for B. Since the genes are independent, the probability of having both dominant alleles is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C (and not B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Same for only B: 3/16. And neither: 1/16.

Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among all possible F2 individuals, considering both genes. Or maybe it's counting the number of each phenotype across all possible F2 individuals, including both F1 and F2. Wait, but the user specified \"the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation,\" implying only F2.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F2 ratio without considering the F1. Let me try recalculating the F2 phenotypic ratios again. The F2 generation consists of four possible phenotypes: A, B, C, D as defined above. Their counts are 9, 3, 3, 1 respectively. Adding these up gives 16, which makes sense because each gene has four possibilities, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 total phenotypes. But the user's answer choices don't include 9,3,3,1. So perhaps I need to reconsider the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Because the user wrote \"F2 generation\" in the question, but didn't specify whether it's F1 or F2. If it were F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, maybe the question is miswritten, and it refers to the F1 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation as the basis for the F2 analysis, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the question is about the F1 generation, which would have four phenotypes in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the user's options don't include such a choice. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F2 generation, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup, perhaps the parents are both homozygous for one trait. For example, if one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the typical Mendelian ratios. But according to the initial setup, the F2 phenotypic ratio is supposed to be one of the options. Looking at option G: 12, 2, which adds up to 14, which doesn't align with 16. Option H: 5,3 sums to 8, which also doesn't fit. Option E: 3,9 sums to 12, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the phenotypes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of having the dominant allele is 3/4 (since 25% homozygous recessive, 50% heterozygous, 25% homozygous dominant). But the presence of the dominant allele in each gene affects the trait. So for a bird to have both traits, both C and B must be present. The probability of having at least one dominant allele in C is 3/4, same for B. Since the genes are independent, the probability of having both dominant alleles is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C (and not B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Same for only B: 3/16. And neither: 1/16. Now, translating this into phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C present, B absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B present, C absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither present): 1/16\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me review the user's options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2\nB. 8, 4\nC. 9, 3\nD. 1, 3\nE. 3, 9\nF. 4, 4\nG. 12, 2\nH. 5, 3\nI. 7, 1\n\nHmm, none of these options seems to directly match what I've calculated. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among all possible F2 individuals, considering both genes. Or maybe it's counting the number of each phenotype across all possible F2 individuals, including both F1 and F2. Wait, but the user specified \"the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation,\" implying only F2.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F2 ratio without considering the F1. Let me try recalculating the F2 phenotypic ratios again. The F2 generation consists of four possible phenotypes: A, B, C, D as defined above. Their counts are 9, 3, 3, 1 respectively. Adding these up gives 16, which makes sense because each gene has four possibilities, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 total phenotypes. But the user's answer choices don't include 9,3,3,1. So perhaps I need to reconsider the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Because the user wrote \"F2 generation\" in the question, but didn't specify whether it's F1 or F2. If it were F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, maybe the question is miswritten, and it refers to the F1 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation as the basis for the F2 analysis, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the question is about the F1 generation, which would have four phenotypes in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the user's options don't include such a choice. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F2 generation, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup, perhaps the parents are both homozygous for one trait. For example, if one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the typical Mendelian ratios. But according to the initial setup, the F2 phenotypic ratio is supposed to be one of the options. Looking at option G: 12, 2, which adds up to 14, which doesn't align with 16. Option H: 5,3 sums to 8, which also doesn't fit. Option E: 3,9 sums to 12, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Another possibility is that the question is about the F2 generation, but the user has miscounted the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, but the options don't reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation, but I'm miscalculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try constructing a Punnett square for F2.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. The F2 will be generated by F1 \u00d7 F1. Each gene follows a Mendelian distribution, so for each gene, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes for each gene are combined. However, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither dominant \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nTo find the probabilities of each category, we can calculate the likelihood of each combination. The probability of a bird having both dominant traits is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant allele in each gene. Since each gene is independent, this would be (probability of C dominant) * (probability of B dominant).\n\n- Probability of C dominant: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Probability of B dominant: 3/4\nThus, the probability of both dominant traits (Phenotype A) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only C dominant (and not B) is (prob C dominant) * (prob B recessive) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nSame logic applies to Phenotype B (only C recessive, B dominant) as 3/16\n\nAnd Phenotype D (neither dominant) is (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio of Phenotypes A:B:C:D is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9,3,3,1.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of thinking in terms of probability for each trait, perhaps it's easier to list all possible combinations and count them. Each bird's phenotype can be represented by a pair of letters: (C, B), where C is R or r, and B is B or b. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. (R, B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. (R, b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. (r, B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. (r, b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, we calculate the number of ways each combination can occur. Since each gene is inherited independently, the total number of possible combinations is 4 (for C) \u00d7 4 (for B) = 16.

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene.",
    "rollout": " Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene. So the possible phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the number of ways each trait can occur. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering the combinations:\n\nFor each bird, the possible phenotypic classes are based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. The number of phenotypic classes is 4 (as above), and the distribution among them depends on the independent assortment of the genes.\n\nIn F2, the number of birds is 16 (since each gene has 4 possible alleles, leading to 4\u00d74=16 combinations). Let's list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype B: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype C: Cases 3, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cases 5, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 4 cases\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 2:A :1:B :2:C :4:D, which simplifies to 2:1:2:4. Wait, but adding up: 2+1+2+4=9. Hmm, but earlier calculation said 16 birds, so perhaps I miscounted. Alternatively, let's count each possibility properly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene. The total number of possible combinations is 16 (4 for each gene). The phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nTo calculate the number in each class:\n\nClass A: All birds with at least one C and one B. How many such birds? From the F2 generation, how many have at least one C and one B?\n\nLooking back at the 16 possibilities:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 A\n- CC Bb \u2192 B\n- CC bb \u2192 C\n- Cc BB \u2192 A\n- Cc Bb \u2192 D\n- Cc bb \u2192 C\n- cc BB \u2192 C\n- cc Bb \u2192 D\n- cc bb \u2192 D\n\nSo, A appears in cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 cases\nB appears in case 2 \u2192 1 case\nC appears in cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3 cases (Wait, no\u2014case 3 is CC bb \u2192 B, case 7 is cc BB \u2192 C, and case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 D. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2\n- B: Case 2 \u2192 1\n- C: Cases 3,6,7 \u2192 3\n- D: Cases 5,8,9 \u2192 3\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+1+3+3=9, but there are 16 birds. Did I miss some?\n\nAh, no\u2014the fourth bird is Cc BB, which is case 4. The fifth is Cc Bb \u2192 D. Sixth is Cc bb \u2192 C. Seventh is cc BB \u2192 C. Eighth is cc Bb \u2192 D. Ninth is cc bb \u2192 D. So cases 5,6,7,8,9 are D; 3 are C; 1 is B; 2 are A. Total: 2+1+3+3=9. Wait, but that leaves 7 birds unaccounted for. What's wrong here? Oh, no\u2014there are only 16 birds, and I've accounted for 9. So missing 7, but I think I may have miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles, and thus the counts should add up to 16. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 16 possibilities, how many fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: All cases where both C and B are present. Looking at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\nSo that's 2.\n\n- Phenotype B: All cases where C is present but B is absent. Looking at the list:\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\nThat's 1.\n\n- Phenotype C: All cases where B is present but C is absent. Looking at the list:\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\nTotal: 3.\n\n- Phenotype D: All remaining cases where neither C nor B is present. Looking at the list:\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\nTotal: 3.\n\nAdding up: 2+1+3+3=9. Wait, that's still 9, leaving 7 birds unaccounted for. This discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in counting. Perhaps I missed some cases.\n\nWait, looking back at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nSo, only 9 cases. Where are the other 7 birds? Maybe I miscounted the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles is incorrect. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by both genes, so each bird's phenotype is a combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the counts should sum to 16. I'm clearly missing something here. Let's try a different approach: for each gene, calculate the number of each type of allele, then combine them.\n\nGene C: Each bird has 2 alleles, so total for the F2 generation is 16 birds \u00d7 2 alleles = 32 alleles. Gene C:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 4 alleles (all C)\n- 50% Cc \u2192 8 alleles (half C, half c)\n- 25% cc \u2192 4 alleles (all c)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nSame breakdown applies.\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B present):\n\nNumber of birds with at least one C and at least one B. Using the formula for independent assortment, this is (number of Cs) \u00d7 (number of Bs) / total, but adjusted for overlap. Alternatively, since each gene has 3 phenotypic categories, the number of each phenotype can be calculated using combinatorics.\n\nThe number of Phenotype A birds is the number of ways to have at least one C and at least one B. For each bird, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: Pheno A\n- C and not B: Pheno B\n- not C and B: Pheno C\n- neither C nor B: Pheno D\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nNumber of Pheno A = Total - (Number with no C) - (Number with no B) + (Number with neither C nor B)\n= 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9\n\nWhich matches our previous count of 9 birds in Pheno A. Similarly,\n\nPheno B = Number with C but not B: 4 (from CC Bb)\nPheno C = Number with B but not C: 4 (from Cc BB, Cc bb)\nPheno D = Number with neither: 8 (from Cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, but according to our earlier count, Pheno A was 2, B was 1, C was 3, D was 3, totaling 9. But this contradicts the inclusion-exclusion result. So perhaps my initial analysis was flawed.\n\nLet me instead count each phenotype directly:\n\nPheno A: All birds with at least one C and one B.\n\nLooking back at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nSo Pheno A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2\nPheno B: Case 2 \u2192 1\nPheno C: Cases 3,6,7 \u2192 3\nPheno D: Cases 5,8,9 \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 2+1+3+3=9. But according to inclusion-exclusion, it should be 9. So why does the inclusion-exclusion suggest 9, but our direct count also sums to 9? Because earlier, I thought the inclusion-exclusion gave 9, matching the direct count. But the user's options don't include a 9 total. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, the user's options are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven that, option F totals to 16 (4+4+4+4), which makes sense. Option G totals to 16, H to 16, etc. So perhaps my initial count of Pheno A as 2, B as 1, C as 3, D as 3 is incorrect, and instead, each phenotype is equally represented, giving a ratio of 4:4:4:4.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the user's answer options seem to suggest that Pheno A is more common than others. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypes. Let me reassess.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of counting based on cases, calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor a bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the probability of a bird being Phenotype A (both C and B present) is:\n\nP(C present) \u00d7 P(B present) = (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, P(B present) \u00d7 P(C present) = same thing.\n\nThen, the probability of Phenotype B (only C present) is:\n\nP(C present) \u00d7 P(B absent) = (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16\n\nSimilarly, P(B present) \u00d7 P(C absent) = 3/16\n\nAnd Phenotype C (only B present) is 3/16\n\nAnd Phenotype D (neither present) is 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype C : Phenotype D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But wait, that adds up to 16 parts, with Phenotype A being 9 and the rest 7. However, this conflicts with the user's options, which all have a 16 total. So perhaps the user's options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic classification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is using a different system where the presence of dominant alleles results in certain colors, but not necessarily all dominant alleles being shown. For instance, if both genes are present, the bird might display a single dominant color, not a blend. But that wouldn't fit the standard genetic terminology. Typically, in dihybrid crosses, each trait is independent and expressed separately unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"red control\" refers to pigment color, and \"brown\" refers to coat color. The dominance hierarchy is given, so checkered is recessive for both, and plain is dominant for both. So in terms of pigmentation, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (i.e., C), it will be red (assuming C is dominant). Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for coat color (B), it will be brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form, independent of the other. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, with Phenotype A (both C and B present) being the most frequent, followed by the others.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio. The closest is option E, which says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the order is reversed. Option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check the problem statement. It says:\n\n- Red is dominant (C)\n- Checkered is recessive (c)\n- Brown is dominant (B)\n- Checkered is recessive (b)\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) is red (dominant), and a bird with at least one dominant allele for coat color (B) is brown. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene independently. Thus, the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. The 9:3:3:1 ratio applies here.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. However, looking at the options, option E has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1, suggesting that the order of checking and checking might be swapped. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the order of phenotypic expression, but the options are presented incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Assuming that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect this, perhaps the best approximation is needed. However, the options provided do not have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, so perhaps the question expects us to think differently.\n\nWait, another angle: the user's options mention \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", etc., implying that the presence of both recessive alleles results in a different phenotype. But according to the problem statement, checkered is recessive for both, and plain is dominant for both. So, if both genes are recessive, the bird is checkered. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n- Both C and B present: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- C present, B absent: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- B present, C absent: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Neither present: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, favoring A over the others. However, the options provided do not have this exact ratio. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the order. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense as a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option E is the closest, despite the order. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that a bird has both dominant alleles for pigment and coat is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of having C dominant and b dominant is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly for B dominant and c dominant. And the probability of neither is 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided do not include this ratio. The closest is option E, which lists 3:9:1:3, but the order is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to provide the ratios in a different order, such as by phenotype, which might not match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the number of birds in each phenotype, not the ratio. So let's recalculate based on the 16 birds:\n\nPheno A: 2 (cases 1,4)\nPheno B: 1 (case 2)\nPheno C: 3 (cases 3,6,7)\nPheno D: 3 (cases 5,8,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene. So the possible phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the number of ways each trait can occur. Alternatively, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering the combinations:\n\nFor each bird, the possible phenotypic classes are based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. The number of phenotypic classes is 4 (as above), and the distribution among them depends on the independent assortment of the genes.\n\nIn F2, the number of birds is 16 (since each gene has 4 possible alleles, leading to 4\u00d74=16 combinations). Let's list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype B: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype C: Cases 3, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cases 5, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 4 cases\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 2:A :1:B :2:C :4:D, which simplifies to 2:1:2:4. Wait, but adding up: 2+1+2+4=9. Hmm, but earlier calculation said 16 birds, so perhaps I miscounted. Alternatively, let's count each possibility properly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene. The total number of possible combinations is 16 (4 for each gene). The phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nTo calculate the number in each class:\n\nClass A: All birds with at least one C and one B. How many such birds? From the F2 generation, how many have at least one C and one B?\n\nLooking back at the 16 possibilities:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 A\n- CC Bb \u2192 B\n- CC bb \u2192 C\n- Cc BB \u2192 A\n- Cc Bb \u2192 D\n- Cc bb \u2192 C\n- cc BB \u2192 C\n- cc Bb \u2192 D\n- cc bb \u2192 D\n\nSo, A appears in cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 cases\nB appears in case 2 \u2192 1 case\nC appears in cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3 cases (Wait, no\u2014case 3 is CC bb \u2192 B, case 7 is cc BB \u2192 C, and case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 D. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2\n- B: Case 2 \u2192 1\n- C: Cases 3,6,7 \u2192 3\n- D: Cases 5,8,9 \u2192 3\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+1+3+3=9, but there are 16 birds. Did I miss some?\n\nAh, no\u2014the fourth bird is Cc BB, which is case 4. The fifth is Cc Bb \u2192 D. Sixth is Cc bb \u2192 C. Seventh is cc BB \u2192 C. Eighth is cc Bb \u2192 D. Ninth is cc bb \u2192 D. So cases 5,6,7,8,9 are D; 3 are C; 1 is B; 2 are A. Total: 2+1+3+3=9. Wait, but that leaves 7 birds unaccounted for. What's wrong here? Oh, no\u2014there are only 16 birds, and I've accounted for 9. So missing 7, but I think I may have miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles, and thus the counts should add up to 16. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 16 possibilities, how many fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: All cases where both C and B are present. Looking at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\nSo that's 2.\n\n- Phenotype B: All cases where C is present but B is absent. Looking at the list:\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\nThat's 1.\n\n- Phenotype C: All cases where B is present but C is absent. Looking at the list:\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\nTotal: 3.\n\n- Phenotype D: All remaining cases where neither C nor B is present. Looking at the list:\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\nTotal: 3.\n\nAdding up: 2+1+3+3=9. Wait, that's still 9, leaving 7 birds unaccounted for. This discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in counting. Perhaps I missed some cases.\n\nWait, looking back at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nSo, only 9 cases. Where are the other 7 birds? Maybe I miscounted the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles is incorrect. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by both genes, so each bird's phenotype is a combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the counts should sum to 16. I'm clearly missing something here. Let's try a different approach: for each gene, calculate the number of each type of allele, then combine them.\n\nGene C: Each bird has 2 alleles, so total for the F2 generation is 16 birds \u00d7 2 alleles = 32 alleles. Gene C:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 4 alleles (all C)\n- 50% Cc \u2192 8 alleles (half C, half c)\n- 25% cc \u2192 4 alleles (all c)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nSame breakdown applies.\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B present):\n\nNumber of birds with at least one C and at least one B. Using the formula for independent assortment, this is (number of Cs) \u00d7 (number of Bs) / total, but adjusted for overlap. Alternatively, since each gene has 3 phenotypic categories, the number of each phenotype can be calculated using combinatorics.\n\nThe number of Phenotype A birds is the number of ways to have at least one C and at least one B. For each bird, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: Pheno A\n- C and not B: Pheno B\n- not C and B: Pheno C\n- neither C nor B: Pheno D\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nNumber of Pheno A = Total - (Number with no C) - (Number with no B) + (Number with neither C nor B)\n= 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9\n\nWhich matches our previous count of 9 birds in Pheno A. Similarly,\n\nPheno B = Number with C but not B: 4 (from CC Bb)\nPheno C = Number with B but not C: 4 (from Cc BB, Cc bb)\nPheno D = Number with neither: 8 (from Cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, but according to our earlier count, Pheno A was 2, B was 1, C was 3, D was 3, totaling 9. But this contradicts the inclusion-exclusion result. So perhaps my initial analysis was flawed.\n\nLet me instead count each phenotype directly:\n\nPheno A: All birds with at least one C and one B.\n\nLooking back at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nSo Pheno A: Cases 1,4 \u2192 2\nPheno B: Case 2 \u2192 1\nPheno C: Cases 3,6,7 \u2192 3\nPheno D: Cases 5,8,9 \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 2+1+3+3=9. But according to inclusion-exclusion, it should be 9. So why does the inclusion-exclusion suggest 9, but our direct count also sums to 9? Because earlier, I thought the inclusion-exclusion gave 9, matching the direct count. But the user's options don't include a 9 total. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, the user's options are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven that, option F totals to 16 (4+4+4+4), which makes sense. Option G totals to 16, H to 16, etc. So perhaps my initial count of Pheno A as 2, B as 1, C as 3, D as 3 is incorrect, and instead, each phenotype is equally represented, giving a ratio of 4:4:4:4.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the user's answer options seem to suggest that Pheno A is more common than others. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypes. Let me reassess.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of counting based on cases, calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor a bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the probability of a bird being Phenotype A (both C and B present) is:\n\nP(C present) \u00d7 P(B present) = (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, P(B present) \u00d7 P(C present) = same thing.\n\nThen, the probability of Phenotype B (only C present) is:\n\nP(C present) \u00d7 P(B absent) = (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16\n\nSimilarly, P(B present) \u00d7 P(C absent) = 3/16\n\nAnd Phenotype C (only B present) is 3/16\n\nAnd Phenotype D (neither present) is 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype C : Phenotype D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But wait, that adds up to 16 parts, with Phenotype A being 9 and the rest 7. However, this conflicts with the user's options, which all have a 16 total. So perhaps the user's options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic classification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is using a different system where the presence of dominant alleles results in certain colors, but not necessarily all dominant alleles being shown. For instance, if both genes are present, the bird might display a single dominant color, not a blend. But that wouldn't fit the standard genetic terminology. Typically, in dihybrid crosses, each trait is independent and expressed separately unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"red control\" refers to pigment color, and \"brown\" refers to coat color. The dominance hierarchy is given, so checkered is recessive for both, and plain is dominant for both. So in terms of pigmentation, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (i.e., C), it will be red (assuming C is dominant). Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for coat color (B), it will be brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form, independent of the other. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, with Phenotype A (both C and B present) being the most frequent, followed by the others.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio. The closest is option E, which says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the order is reversed. Option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check the problem statement. It says:\n\n- Red is dominant (C)\n- Checkered is recessive (c)\n- Brown is dominant (B)\n- Checkered is recessive (b)\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) is red (dominant), and a bird with at least one dominant allele for coat color (B) is brown. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene independently. Thus, the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. The 9:3:3:1 ratio applies here.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. However, looking at the options, option E has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1, suggesting that the order of checking and checking might be swapped. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the order of phenotypic expression, but the options are presented incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Assuming that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect this, perhaps the best approximation is needed. However, the options provided do not have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, so perhaps the question expects us to think differently.\n\nWait, another angle: the user's options mention \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", etc., implying that the presence of both recessive alleles results in a different phenotype. But according to the problem statement, checkered is recessive for both, and plain is dominant for both. So, if both genes are recessive, the bird is checkered. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n- Both C and B present: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- C present, B absent: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- B present, C absent: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Neither present: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, favoring A over the others. However, the options provided do not have this exact ratio. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the order. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense as a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option E is the closest, despite the order. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that a bird has both dominant alleles for pigment and coat is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of having C dominant and b dominant is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly for B dominant and c dominant. And the probability of neither is 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided do not include this ratio. The closest is option E, which lists 3:9:1:3, but the order is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to provide the ratios in a different order, such as by phenotype, which might not match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the number of birds in each phenotype, not the ratio. So let's recalculate based on the 16 birds:\n\nPheno A: 2 (cases 1,4)\nPheno B: 1 (case 2)\nPheno C: 3 (cases 3,6,7)\nPheno D: 3 (cases 5,8,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each gene, the probability of being present (dominant) is 3/4, and absent is 1/4.",
    "rollout": " For each gene, the probability of being present (dominant) is 3/4, and absent is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C (not B): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B (not C): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither C nor B: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, converting these fractions to percentages: \n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n- Phenotype B: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nBut wait, none of the options given seem to match exactly, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me revisit the question.\n\nThe question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the plain color by a recessive allele c. So the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, while the color is determined by the dominant C. Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is due to c, and the plain is due to C. So the presence of c results in checkering, and C results in plain color. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the checkered pattern is only expressed if the bird has the recessive allele for color (c), and the plain is expressed otherwise. Wait, no\u2014because the problem says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C\", which seems contradictory. Wait, no\u2014if C is dominant, then having at least one C allele makes the bird checkered. Wait, no\u2014checkered is expressed when the bird has the recessive allele for color, i.e., c. Because the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So red is expressed when B is present (B_), and brown is when b is present (_b). Checkered is expressed when c is present (because c is recessive, so only when both alleles are c do you get checkered). Wait, no\u2014the problem states that checkered is due to the recessive allele c, so the presence of c in either gene would lead to checkered. Wait, but the description says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So brown is when b is present, and red is when B is present. Checkered is when c is present for both genes. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nWait, that would mean that the presence of the dominant allele C results in plain color, and the recessive allele c results in checkered. But that contradicts the usual understanding because usually, a dominant allele masks the recessive one. Wait, perhaps the problem uses C as the dominant for something else, and c as the recessive. Let me re-express the problem statement properly.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n- \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, for color:\n\n- B is dominant: red (since B_ is dominant)\n- b is recessive: brown (_b)\n\nFor pattern:\n\n- C is dominant: checkered (?)\n- c is recessive: plain\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- To have red color, the bird must have at least one B allele (B_).\n- To have brown color, the bird must have at least one b allele (_b).\n- To have checkered pattern, the bird must have at least one c allele (c_).\n- To have plain color, the bird must have at least one _ allele (i.e., both are non-c).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both color and pattern. So, a bird will be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both B and c present \u2192 Red and checkered\n- Phenotype 2: Both b and c present \u2192 Brown and checkered\n- Phenotype 3: B present and b present \u2192 Red and brown\n- Phenotype 4: None of the dominant alleles \u2192 Plain and plain\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain by the recessive c. Wait, no\u2014the problem says:\n\n- \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- C is dominant for checkered\n- c is recessive for checkered\n- B is dominant for red\n- b is recessive for red\n- B is dominant for brown\n- b is recessive for brown\n\nWait, that can't be right because a bird cannot have both B and b; only one can be present. So, perhaps the problem meant:\n\n- B is dominant for color (either red or brown)\n- b is recessive for color (both B and b)\n- C is dominant for pattern (checkered)\n- c is recessive for pattern (plain)\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both:\n\n- Presence of at least one B allele (for color) and at least one c allele (for pattern):\n    - If both are present \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and checkered\n- Else if B is present and c is absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and plain\n- Else if B is absent and c is present \u2192 Phenotype C: Brown and checkered\n- Else if B is absent and c is absent \u2192 Phenotype D: Brown and plain\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the standard genetic terminology. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and checkered (A)\n2. Red and plain (B)\n3. Brown and checkered (C)\n4. Brown and plain (D)\n\nNow, to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype, we'll look at the possible gametes from the parents. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous for both dominant traits (assuming dominant alleles mask recessives)\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous for both recessive traits\n\nWhen these parents mate, the F1 generation will be:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C locus (pattern):\n\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\n\nThus, the gametes for C are:\n\n- 25% C (from Parent 1)\n- 25% c (from Parent 2)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (color):\n\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\n\nGametes for B:\n\n- 25% B\n- 25% b\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are all possible combinations of C and B gametes:\n\n1. C \u00d7 B \u2192 CB\n2. C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb\n3. c \u00d7 B \u2192 cB\n4. c \u00d7 b \u2192 cb\n\nSince each parent is homozygous, the F1 will be:\n\n- 25% CB (from Parent 1's C and Parent 2's B)\n- 25% Cb (from Parent 1's C and Parent 2's b)\n- 25% cB (from Parent 1's c and Parent 2's B)\n- 25% cb (from Parent 1's c and Parent 2's b)\n\nThese F1 individuals will selfmate to produce F2. Each F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider all possible combinations of these gametes and their resulting phenotypes. However, since the problem asks specifically for the F2 phenotypic ratio, we can instead focus on the possible phenotypic classes without enumerating all gamete combinations.\n\nAlternatively, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, their offspring will follow Mendel's laws. The F2 generation will have the following possible phenotypes based on the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nMating these will result in F1: CcBb\n\nF1 selfing:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB, Cb, cB, cb in equal proportions (25%).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and brown\n- From CB \u00d7 Cb: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From CB \u00d7 cB: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and plain\n- From Cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From Cb \u00d7 Cb: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C: Brown and checkered\n- From cB \u00d7 CB: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From cB \u00d7 Cb: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D: Brown and plain\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratio:\n\nPhenotype A: All cases except when both B and c are present. How many?\n\nLooking at the possible F2:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- CB \u00d7 Cb \u2192 A\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 A\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 B\n- Cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- Cb \u00d7 Cb \u2192 C\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- cB \u00d7 Cb \u2192 A\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 D\n\nCounting A: 7 cases\nB: 1\nC: 1\nD: 1\n\nTotal: 10 cases\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nA: 7\nB: 1\nC: 1\nD: 1\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 7:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, option G is phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our calculation. Option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Our calculation shows 7:1:1:1, which isn't listed among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me double-check the counts. Total F2 offspring: 16 (since each of the four F1 gametes combines with each other, giving 16 combinations).\n\nPhenotype A: Cases where both B and c are present. This happens when:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 A\n- Cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 A\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- cb \u00d7 Cb \u2192 A\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype B: Cases where B is present (B_) and c is absent (cc). These are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 B_\n- Cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 B_\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 B_\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype C: Cases where B is absent (_B) and c is present (cc). These are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B_\n- cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype D: Cases where both B and c are absent (_b_). These are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 B_\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 B_\n- cB \u00d7 cc \u2192 B_\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nWait, that adds up to 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16, which is correct. So the distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4\n- Phenotype B: 4\n- Phenotype C: 4\n- Phenotype D: 4\n\nWait, that means all four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring 25% of the time. But the options don't reflect this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB.8:4:0:4\n\nC.9:3:3:1\n\nD.1:1:3:9\n\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nF.4:4:4:4\n\nG.12:2:2:2\n\nH.5:3:2:6\n\nI.7:5:1:3\n\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nK.4:4:4:4\n\nL.3:9:1:3\n\nWait, my count was 4 for each phenotype, totaling 16. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Perhaps I misapplied the problem. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would indeed be CcBb. When selfed, the F2 would have the phenotypic ratio as follows:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25%.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 Cb)\n- 25% cc (from cB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, F2 will have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% cb. But the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is present.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC (red color) and cc (plain) \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and plain\n- Cc (red) and cc (plain) \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and plain\n- Cc (red) and cb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype C: Red and checkered\n- cc (plain) and cb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n- cc (plain) and cc (plain) \u2192 Phenotype E: Plain and plain\n\nWait, that changes things. So, phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nThus:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and b present \u2192 C_ and b_, which is red and brown.\nPhenotype B: C_ and cc \u2192 red and plain.\nPhenotype C: c_ and b_ \u2192 checkered and brown.\nPhenotype D: cc and c_ \u2192 plain and checkered.\nPhenotype E: cc and cc \u2192 plain and plain.\n\nCalculating the number of each:\n\n- Phenotype A: (CC \u00d7 cc) \u2192 25%, plus (Cc \u00d7 cb) \u2192 25%, plus (cc \u00d7 cc) \u2192 25%?\nWait, no\u2014let me list all combinations:\n\nF2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. 25% CC (C_) \u00d7 25% cc (cc) \u2192 Phenotype E (plain and plain)\n2. 25% CC \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and plain)\n3. 25% Cc \u00d7 25% cc \u2192 Phenotype B (red and plain)\n4. 25% Cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype C (red and checkered)\n5. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cc \u2192 Phenotype E (plain and plain)\n6. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n7. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n8. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nWait, but this approach isn't accounting for all possible gamete combinations correctly. Instead, I should calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype A: Both C_ and b_. This requires C_ and b_. The chance of having C_ is 75% (since 25% CC and 50% Cc are C_), and the chance of having b_ is 75% (since 25% bb and 75% Bb are b_). However, since the presence of C_ and b_ are independent, the probability of both is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625, or 56.25%. But wait, in reality, the phenotypes are determined by both genes, so we need to consider the actual phenotypic expression.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red.\n- If b is present (b_), it's brown.\n- If both are present, it's red and brown.\n- If neither is present, it's plain and plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C_ and b_: Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n2. C_ and b_: Phenotype A\n3. C_ and bb (no b): Phenotype B (Red and plain)\n4. cc and b_: Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n5. cc and bb: Phenotype D (Plain and plain)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: C_ and b_ \u2192 P(C_) = 3/4, P(b_) = 3/4 \u2192 P(A) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C_ and bb \u2192 P(C_) = 3/4, P(bb) = 1/4 \u2192 P(B) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: cc and b_ \u2192 P(cc) = 1/4, P(b_) = 3/4 \u2192 P(C) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of being present (dominant) is 3/4, and absent is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C (not B): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B (not C): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither C nor B: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, converting these fractions to percentages: \n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n- Phenotype B: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nBut wait, none of the options given seem to match exactly, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me revisit the question.\n\nThe question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the plain color by a recessive allele c. So the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, while the color is determined by the dominant C. Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is due to c, and the plain is due to C. So the presence of c results in checkering, and C results in plain color. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the checkered pattern is only expressed if the bird has the recessive allele for color (c), and the plain is expressed otherwise. Wait, no\u2014because the problem says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C\", which seems contradictory. Wait, no\u2014if C is dominant, then having at least one C allele makes the bird checkered. Wait, no\u2014checkered is expressed when the bird has the recessive allele for color, i.e., c. Because the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So red is expressed when B is present (B_), and brown is when b is present (_b). Checkered is expressed when c is present (because c is recessive, so only when both alleles are c do you get checkered). Wait, no\u2014the problem states that checkered is due to the recessive allele c, so the presence of c in either gene would lead to checkered. Wait, but the description says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So brown is when b is present, and red is when B is present. Checkered is when c is present for both genes. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nWait, that would mean that the presence of the dominant allele C results in plain color, and the recessive allele c results in checkered. But that contradicts the usual understanding because usually, a dominant allele masks the recessive one. Wait, perhaps the problem uses C as the dominant for something else, and c as the recessive. Let me re-express the problem statement properly.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n- \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, for color:\n\n- B is dominant: red (since B_ is dominant)\n- b is recessive: brown (_b)\n\nFor pattern:\n\n- C is dominant: checkered (?)\n- c is recessive: plain\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- To have red color, the bird must have at least one B allele (B_).\n- To have brown color, the bird must have at least one b allele (_b).\n- To have checkered pattern, the bird must have at least one c allele (c_).\n- To have plain color, the bird must have at least one _ allele (i.e., both are non-c).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both color and pattern. So, a bird will be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both B and c present \u2192 Red and checkered\n- Phenotype 2: Both b and c present \u2192 Brown and checkered\n- Phenotype 3: B present and b present \u2192 Red and brown\n- Phenotype 4: None of the dominant alleles \u2192 Plain and plain\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain by the recessive c. Wait, no\u2014the problem says:\n\n- \"Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- C is dominant for checkered\n- c is recessive for checkered\n- B is dominant for red\n- b is recessive for red\n- B is dominant for brown\n- b is recessive for brown\n\nWait, that can't be right because a bird cannot have both B and b; only one can be present. So, perhaps the problem meant:\n\n- B is dominant for color (either red or brown)\n- b is recessive for color (both B and b)\n- C is dominant for pattern (checkered)\n- c is recessive for pattern (plain)\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both:\n\n- Presence of at least one B allele (for color) and at least one c allele (for pattern):\n    - If both are present \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and checkered\n- Else if B is present and c is absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and plain\n- Else if B is absent and c is present \u2192 Phenotype C: Brown and checkered\n- Else if B is absent and c is absent \u2192 Phenotype D: Brown and plain\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the standard genetic terminology. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and checkered (A)\n2. Red and plain (B)\n3. Brown and checkered (C)\n4. Brown and plain (D)\n\nNow, to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype, we'll look at the possible gametes from the parents. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous for both dominant traits (assuming dominant alleles mask recessives)\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous for both recessive traits\n\nWhen these parents mate, the F1 generation will be:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C locus (pattern):\n\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\n\nThus, the gametes for C are:\n\n- 25% C (from Parent 1)\n- 25% c (from Parent 2)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (color):\n\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\n\nGametes for B:\n\n- 25% B\n- 25% b\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are all possible combinations of C and B gametes:\n\n1. C \u00d7 B \u2192 CB\n2. C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb\n3. c \u00d7 B \u2192 cB\n4. c \u00d7 b \u2192 cb\n\nSince each parent is homozygous, the F1 will be:\n\n- 25% CB (from Parent 1's C and Parent 2's B)\n- 25% Cb (from Parent 1's C and Parent 2's b)\n- 25% cB (from Parent 1's c and Parent 2's B)\n- 25% cb (from Parent 1's c and Parent 2's b)\n\nThese F1 individuals will selfmate to produce F2. Each F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider all possible combinations of these gametes and their resulting phenotypes. However, since the problem asks specifically for the F2 phenotypic ratio, we can instead focus on the possible phenotypic classes without enumerating all gamete combinations.\n\nAlternatively, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, their offspring will follow Mendel's laws. The F2 generation will have the following possible phenotypes based on the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nMating these will result in F1: CcBb\n\nF1 selfing:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB, Cb, cB, cb in equal proportions (25%).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and brown\n- From CB \u00d7 Cb: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From CB \u00d7 cB: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and plain\n- From Cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From Cb \u00d7 Cb: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C: Brown and checkered\n- From cB \u00d7 CB: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From cB \u00d7 Cb: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D: Brown and plain\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratio:\n\nPhenotype A: All cases except when both B and c are present. How many?\n\nLooking at the possible F2:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- CB \u00d7 Cb \u2192 A\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 A\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 B\n- Cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- Cb \u00d7 Cb \u2192 C\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- cB \u00d7 Cb \u2192 A\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 D\n\nCounting A: 7 cases\nB: 1\nC: 1\nD: 1\n\nTotal: 10 cases\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nA: 7\nB: 1\nC: 1\nD: 1\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 7:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, option G is phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our calculation. Option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Our calculation shows 7:1:1:1, which isn't listed among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me double-check the counts. Total F2 offspring: 16 (since each of the four F1 gametes combines with each other, giving 16 combinations).\n\nPhenotype A: Cases where both B and c are present. This happens when:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 A\n- Cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 A\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 A\n- cb \u00d7 Cb \u2192 A\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype B: Cases where B is present (B_) and c is absent (cc). These are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 B_\n- Cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 B_\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 B_\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype C: Cases where B is absent (_B) and c is present (cc). These are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B_\n- cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nPhenotype D: Cases where both B and c are absent (_b_). These are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 B_\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 B_\n- cB \u00d7 cc \u2192 B_\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 B_\nThat's 4 cases.\n\nWait, that adds up to 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16, which is correct. So the distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4\n- Phenotype B: 4\n- Phenotype C: 4\n- Phenotype D: 4\n\nWait, that means all four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring 25% of the time. But the options don't reflect this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB.8:4:0:4\n\nC.9:3:3:1\n\nD.1:1:3:9\n\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nF.4:4:4:4\n\nG.12:2:2:2\n\nH.5:3:2:6\n\nI.7:5:1:3\n\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nK.4:4:4:4\n\nL.3:9:1:3\n\nWait, my count was 4 for each phenotype, totaling 16. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Perhaps I misapplied the problem. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would indeed be CcBb. When selfed, the F2 would have the phenotypic ratio as follows:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25%.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 Cb)\n- 25% cc (from cB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, F2 will have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% cb. But the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is present.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC (red color) and cc (plain) \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and plain\n- Cc (red) and cc (plain) \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and plain\n- Cc (red) and cb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype C: Red and checkered\n- cc (plain) and cb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n- cc (plain) and cc (plain) \u2192 Phenotype E: Plain and plain\n\nWait, that changes things. So, phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nThus:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and b present \u2192 C_ and b_, which is red and brown.\nPhenotype B: C_ and cc \u2192 red and plain.\nPhenotype C: c_ and b_ \u2192 checkered and brown.\nPhenotype D: cc and c_ \u2192 plain and checkered.\nPhenotype E: cc and cc \u2192 plain and plain.\n\nCalculating the number of each:\n\n- Phenotype A: (CC \u00d7 cc) \u2192 25%, plus (Cc \u00d7 cb) \u2192 25%, plus (cc \u00d7 cc) \u2192 25%?\nWait, no\u2014let me list all combinations:\n\nF2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. 25% CC (C_) \u00d7 25% cc (cc) \u2192 Phenotype E (plain and plain)\n2. 25% CC \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and plain)\n3. 25% Cc \u00d7 25% cc \u2192 Phenotype B (red and plain)\n4. 25% Cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype C (red and checkered)\n5. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cc \u2192 Phenotype E (plain and plain)\n6. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n7. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n8. 25% cc \u00d7 25% cb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nWait, but this approach isn't accounting for all possible gamete combinations correctly. Instead, I should calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nPhenotype A: Both C_ and b_. This requires C_ and b_. The chance of having C_ is 75% (since 25% CC and 50% Cc are C_), and the chance of having b_ is 75% (since 25% bb and 75% Bb are b_). However, since the presence of C_ and b_ are independent, the probability of both is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625, or 56.25%. But wait, in reality, the phenotypes are determined by both genes, so we need to consider the actual phenotypic expression.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red.\n- If b is present (b_), it's brown.\n- If both are present, it's red and brown.\n- If neither is present, it's plain and plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C_ and b_: Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n2. C_ and b_: Phenotype A\n3. C_ and bb (no b): Phenotype B (Red and plain)\n4. cc and b_: Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n5. cc and bb: Phenotype D (Plain and plain)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: C_ and b_ \u2192 P(C_) = 3/4, P(b_) = 3/4 \u2192 P(A) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C_ and bb \u2192 P(C_) = 3/4, P(bb) = 1/4 \u2192 P(B) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: cc and b_ \u2192 P(cc) = 1/4, P(b_) = 3/4 \u2192 P(C) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D:",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Instead of thinking in terms of percentages, let's count the number of possible combinations.",
    "rollout": " Instead of thinking in terms of percentages, let's count the number of possible combinations. For each gene, there are 4 possibilities (since each can be CC, Cc, cC, cc). But since the genes are independent, the total number of combinations is 4 x 4 = 16. Now, the phenotypes correspond to whether each gene is present. For each bird:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele): red (for pigment)\n- If B is present (at least one B allele): brown (for body)\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of both, or either, of these traits. The phenotypic classes can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of thinking in terms of percentages, let's count the number of possible combinations. For each gene, there are 4 possibilities (since each can be CC, Cc, cC, cc). But since the genes are independent, the total number of combinations is 4 x 4 = 16. Now, the phenotypes correspond to whether each gene is present. For each bird:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele): red (for pigment)\n- If B is present (at least one B allele): brown (for body)\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of both, or either, of these traits. The phenotypic classes can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the counts:\n\nFor each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- C/C: 25%\n- C/c: 50%\n- c/c: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C present): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither C nor B present): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Now, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nHmm, option G is 9, 3, 3, 1, which matches our calculation.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The possible combinations are:\n\nPhenotype | C Present | B Present | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nA | Yes | Yes | ?\nB | Yes | No | ?\nC | No | Yes | ?\nD | No | No | ?\n\nTo find the probabilities:\n\n- A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- B: C present, B not \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)= 3/16\n- C: C not, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but ordered as A:B:C:D.\n\nNow, translating this back to the options given, let's look at option G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2014 that matches our calculation. Option E has 3 checkered red and 9 plain red, which seems inverted. Similarly, option J has checkered red 2 and plain brown 6, which doesn't align with our calculations. Option H has 5 checkered red and 3 plain brown, which also doesn't fit. Option I has 7 checkered red and 5 plain brown, which is closer but still not matching. Option F has 4 each, which is less than our 9:3:3:1 distribution. Option C has 12 checkered red, which is much higher. Option D has 1 checkered red and others too low. Option B has 8,4, which doesn't match. Option A has 6,2, which is different. So the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of phenotypic classes is 4, but each class corresponds to different combinations of dominant and recessive traits. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nTotal = 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since any C allele makes it present)\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo the probability of a bird having both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n\nThe probability of a bird having only C (and B absent) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n\nThe probability of a bird having only B (and C absent) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n\nThe probability of a bird having neither (both C and B absent) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, looking at the options given, we need to match these probabilities to the answer choices.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly for B. But since the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability of a bird having both traits is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of having only C (not B) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Similarly, only B is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. And neither is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios: \n\nTotal Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratio, we can divide each by the smallest number, which is 1, giving us 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Instead of calculating probabilities for each trait separately, I should consider all possible combinations.",
    "rollout": " Instead of calculating probabilities for each trait separately, I should consider all possible combinations. The four phenotypic classes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits. The number of ways each combination can occur is based on the Punnett square. For each gene, there are three possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele), but since each bird has two genes, the total phenotypic classes are 3 x 3 = 9. However, many combinations are impossible. For example, a bird cannot have both C and B absent because that would require both recessive alleles, which is possible only if both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, then both traits are absent. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class is calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: (Probability of C dominant) * (Probability of B dominant) \n= (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: (Probability of C dominant) * (Probability of B recessive)\n= (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: (Probability of C recessive) * (Probability of B dominant)\n= (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: (Probability of C recessive) * (Probability of B recessive)\n= (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio of Phenotype A : B : C : D is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of calculating probabilities for each trait separately, I should consider all possible combinations. The four phenotypic classes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits. The number of ways each combination can occur is based on the Punnett square. For each gene, there are three possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele), but since each bird has two genes, the total phenotypic classes are 3 x 3 = 9. However, many combinations are impossible. For example, a bird cannot have both C and B absent because that would require both recessive alleles, which is possible only if both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, then both traits are absent. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class is calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: (Probability of C dominant) * (Probability of B dominant) \n= (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: (Probability of C dominant) * (Probability of B recessive)\n= (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: (Probability of C recessive) * (Probability of B dominant)\n= (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: (Probability of C recessive) * (Probability of B recessive)\n= (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio of Phenotype A : B : C : D is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding up, 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user options don't include 9:3:3:1. Hmm, let me check the options again.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

    "rollout": " The number of phenotypic classes is 2^2 = 4, each representing a unique combination of the presence or absence of each dominant trait.

The probability of a bird having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. Since these are independent, the combined probability for both traits is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for Phenotype A. For Phenotype B, it's the probability of C present times B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, Phenotype C is (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16. Phenotype D is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. Now, converting these fractions to ratios: Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking back at the options provided, option G states Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1/16, and checkered brown is Phenotype C, which is 3/16. Wait, but in the options given, option G says \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Hmm, but according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red (Phenotype D) : checkered brown (Phenotype C) : plain red (Phenotype A) : plain brown (Phenotype B) as 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, option G matches this exactly: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of phenotypic classes is 2^2 = 4, each representing a unique combination of the presence or absence of each dominant trait. So:\n\nClass 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\nClass 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\nClass 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\nClass 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, the probabilities for each class are calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. The probability of a bird having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. Since these are independent, the combined probability for both traits is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for Phenotype A. For Phenotype B, it's the probability of C present times B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, Phenotype C is (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16. Phenotype D is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. Now, converting these fractions to ratios: Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking back at the options provided, option G states Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1/16, and checkered brown is Phenotype C, which is 3/16. Wait, but in the options given, option G says \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Hmm, but according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red (Phenotype D) : checkered brown (Phenotype C) : plain red (Phenotype A) : plain brown (Phenotype B) as 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, option G matches this exactly: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having only C (no B) is (number of C without B) divided by total. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented by a pair (C, B), where C is present (R) or not (P), and B is present (B) or not (b).

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having both traits is the probability of having at least one dominant allele in both genes. Alternatively, the probability of having C present is 3/4, and the probability of having B present is also 3/4. Since these are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C (no B) is (number of C without B) divided by total. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented by a pair (C, B), where C is present (R) or not (P), and B is present (B) or not (b). So possible pairs are:\n\n1. (R, R) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. (R, b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. (P, R) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. (P, b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probability of each pair is calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present (R): 3/4 (since 25% RR, 50% Rr, 25% rr \u2192 75% RR and Rr, so 3/4)\nSimilarly, for B locus:\n- Probability of B present (B): 3/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nThus:\n- Phenotype A (R, R): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (R, b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (P, R): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (P, b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which adds up to 16 parts. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. The closest option is G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4.",
    "rollout": " For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. Since these are independent, the probability of both being present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present (but not B): (1/4)(3/4)=3/16. Only B present (but not C): (3/4)(1/4)=3/16. Neither present: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16. But wait, that can\u2019t be right because the sum would be 9+3+3+1=16, which works. So now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds:\n\n- Phenotype A (both present): 9/16 of the birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation. The F2 is generated by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. As each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. But wait, since each gene is independent, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (C dominant, red)\n- 50% Cc (C dominant, still red)\n- 25% cc (c recessive, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (B dominant, brown)\n- 50% Bb (B dominant, brown)\n- 25% bb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nHowever, the phenotype combines both traits. So the possible phenotypes are the combinations above. Now, the F2 will have a certain distribution among these phenotypes. Let me calculate the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B present): This occurs when C is present and B is present. The probability of C being present is 3/4, and B is also 3/4, so combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (only C present): C is present (3/4), but B is absent (1/4). So probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (only B present): B is present (3/4), but C is absent (1/4). Probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (neither present): Both C and B are absent. Probability is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nSo in terms of F2:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThese correspond to the expected phenotypic ratios.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. Since these are independent, the probability of both being present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present (but not B): (1/4)(3/4)=3/16. Only B present (but not C): (3/4)(1/4)=3/16. Neither present: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16. But wait, that can\u2019t be right because the sum would be 9+3+3+1=16, which works. So now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds:\n\n- Phenotype A (both present): 9/16 of the birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation. The F2 is generated by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. As each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. But wait, since each gene is independent, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (C dominant, red)\n- 50% Cc (C dominant, still red)\n- 25% cc (c recessive, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (B dominant, brown)\n- 50% Bb (B dominant, brown)\n- 25% bb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nHowever, the phenotype combines both traits. So the possible phenotypes are the combinations above. Now, the F2 will have a certain distribution among these phenotypes. Let me calculate the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B present): This occurs when C is present and B is present. The probability of C being present is 3/4, and B is also 3/4, so combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (only C present): C is present (3/4), but B is absent (1/4). So probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (only B present): B is present (3/4), but C is absent (1/4). Probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (neither present): Both C and B are absent. Probability is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nSo in terms of F2:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThese correspond to the expected phenotypic ratios. Now, looking back at the options provided, I need to match this ratio to one of them.\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB.

Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nLooking at our calculations, the F2 phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- 9/16 Checkered red (phenotype A)\n- 3/16 Checkered brown (phenotype B)\n- 3/16 Plain red (phenotype C)\n- 1/16 Plain brown (phenotype D)\n\nWhich translates to counts assuming a population size of 16:\n\n- 9 Checkered red\n- 3 Checkered brown\n- 3 Plain red\n- 1 Plain brown\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Let me look closer. Option G says:\n\nCheckered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThat's different. Option C:\n\nCheckered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nHmm, close but not matching. Option F:\n\nCheckered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nOption H:\n\nCheckered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOption I:\n\nCheckered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, none seem to fit perfectly. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check. Oh, wait! I think I messed up the calculation for the phenotypic ratio. Because when both traits are present, it's a different category than just having one trait. Also, the phenotypic ratios aren't simply adding up percentages but considering the actual count of each phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratio is about the proportion of each phenotype relative to others, not absolute counts unless specified. So the correct approach is to express the ratio of counts based on the probabilities we calculated. Since the F2 population is 16, and the phenotypes are:\n\n- 9 Checkered red\n- 3 Checkered brown\n- 3 Plain red\n- 1 Plain brown\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Exactly matches our calculation.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Different ratio.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Different.\nOption I:7:5:1:3 \u2192 Different.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present (i.e., B absent) \u2192 3/16 (since 3/4 have C, but 1/4 don't have B)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present (i.e., C absent) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, adding up to 16. Now, looking back at the options given, none of them match exactly, but let's look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.2,6,3,9\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nOur calculation says the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each trait, the presence is determined by whether the dominant allele is present. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B present \u2192 probability is (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 prob = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 prob = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 prob = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios: 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options:\n\nOptions A to H are given, but I don't see 9:3:3:1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the options include numbers like 6, 8, etc., so maybe I miscalculated. Let me re-examine the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F1 was wrong. Let me double-check the F1 generation.\n\nParents: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when they mate, the F1 should be heterozygous for each gene: CcBb. So the F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 will have the following probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor gene C (C and c):\n- C: 75%\n- c: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for gene B (B and b):\n- B: 75%\n- b: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the possible phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these probabilities. As earlier, the phenotypic classes are 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option G says 12:2:2:0, which seems off because our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Option E has 3:9:3:1, which is also different. Option J has 2:6:2:6, which sums up to 16, not matching our 16 parts. Option D has 1:7:5:3, which doesn't align. Option B is 6:2:6:2, which is also not matching. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Wait, no\u2014more accurately, the probability of Phenotype A is the probability that both C and B are present. Using the Punnett square approach, the probability that a bird has both C and B is (number of squares where C and B are present) divided by total squares.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible phenotypic classes is 4. The probabilities can be calculated by looking at the possible genotypes:\n\nPhenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present. This happens in 3/4 of the cases (since any bird without a dominant C or B doesn't have both). Wait, no\u2014more accurately, the probability of Phenotype A is the probability that both C and B are present. Using the Punnett square approach, the probability that a bird has both C and B is (number of squares where C and B are present) divided by total squares. Looking back at the initial Punnett square for the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC and BB \u2192 probability (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Phenotype B: CC and bb \u2192 (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n- Phenotype C: cc and BB \u2192 (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Phenotype D: cc and bb \u2192 (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 25%, but that can't be right because each bird has two traits. I must be misunderstanding something here. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it differently by considering the possible combinations of the two genes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B are present (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 3/4 chance of C (since 3/4 have at least one C) times 3/4 chance of B \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present (no B) \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B present (no C) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio becomes 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But wait, that sums to 16 parts. However, let me verify this with the Punnett square approach. Constructing a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering both genes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: C and B present \u2192 (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4 C) * (1/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 (1/4 B) * (3/4 C) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4 B) * (1/4 C) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 Phenotype A, 3 Phenotype B, 3 Phenotype C, and 1 Phenotype D. But none of the options given match this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 2,6,3,9\n\nHmm, option C seems to match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. But let me double-check. Maybe I misapplied the rules. Another approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: B present, C absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Neither \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Wait, but this seems off because the sum of 9+3+3+1=16 equals 16, which works. So now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds, if we assume a large population, then:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16 of the birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the chance of C being present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele), and similarly for B. But since the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The probability of only C (no B) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. The probability of only B is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. Wait, but this seems off because the sum of 9+3+3+1=16 equals 16, which works. So now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds, if we assume a large population, then:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16 of the birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nEtc.\n\nWait, none of these options seem to add up to 16. Option C adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which matches our calculation. So option C's phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But wait, according to our earlier analysis, the phenotypes are categorized as:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 \u2192 9 checkered red and brown\n- Phenotype B: 3/16 \u2192 3 checkered red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 \u2192 3 plain red and brown\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 \u2192 1 plain red and checkered\n\nThus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with option C. However, looking back, I thought option C was \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is exactly what we've got. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Using a Punnett square for the F2:\n\n       |    C (3/4)   |    c (1/4)\n-------|---------------|-------\n     B (3/4)| (3/4)(3/4)=9/16 | (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n-------|---------------|-------\n     b (1/4)| (1/4)(3/4)=3/16 | (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo, the four cells represent the probabilities of each phenotype. Therefore:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C, no B): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B, no C): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither C nor B): 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check. The options are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But let me look back at the options provided. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches. So the answer should be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

So a bird with C and B will have both traits, while a bird with C and b will have pigment red and plain body. Similarly for others. So the correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no\u2014that can't be. Because according to my calculation, only the last category is 1/16, which is the plain and checkered. So why does option G say plain red and plain brown?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I messed up the definitions. Let me clarify: \n\n- Pigment red: dominant allele C\n- Pigment brown: dominant allele B\n\nBody color:\n\n- Checkered: recessive allele b (for both genes)\n- Plain: recessive allele c (for both genes)\n\nTherefore, the phenotype classes are:\n\n1.

Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nWait, now that changes things. So the original thought was wrong. The phenotypic classes are based on both genes. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So among the options, none directly match this, except perhaps option G, which states 12:2:2:0. But according to my calculation, that's not matching.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible combinations for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- C (present): 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- c (absent): 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- B (present): 3/4\n- b (absent): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of a bird having both traits is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\nThe probability of having only C (and not B) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\nThe probability of having only B (and not C) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\nThe probability of having neither (both c and b) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into the phenotypic ratios:\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which seems different. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me re-examine. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So a bird with C and B will have both traits, while a bird with C and b will have pigment red and plain body. Similarly for others. So the correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no\u2014that can't be. Because according to my calculation, only the last category is 1/16, which is the plain and checkered. So why does option G say plain red and plain brown?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I messed up the definitions. Let me clarify: \n\n- Pigment red: dominant allele C\n- Pigment brown: dominant allele B\n\nBody color:\n\n- Checkered: recessive allele b (for both genes)\n- Plain: recessive allele c (for both genes)\n\nTherefore, the phenotype classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Phenotype A: 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and body plain (c): Phenotype B: 3/16\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): Phenotype C: 3/16\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nWait, now that changes things. So the original thought was wrong. The phenotypic classes are based on both genes. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So among the options, none directly match this, except perhaps option G, which states 12:2:2:0. But according to my calculation, that's not matching. Did I miscalculate something?\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps the problem considers the F2 generation without considering the entire F2 population but instead looking at the F1 generation. No, the question asks about the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that only certain phenotypes are observed. Let me double-check the options:\n\nLooking back at the options given, perhaps I misread the options earlier. Let me list them again:\n\nA.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present.",
    "rollout": " Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, to get the ratio of these phenotypes, we divide each by the sum (which is 16/16):\n\n- A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- D: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D \u2192 So 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, to get the ratio of these phenotypes, we divide each by the sum (which is 16/16):\n\n- A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- D: 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D \u2192 So 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me try a different approach by constructing a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.

The number of each type is as follows:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014because each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and then convert them to phenotypes:\n\n1.

However, looking at the options provided, I don't see a 9:3:3:1 option. Instead, I see options like E: 3,9,1,3 and others. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. The user provides a setup where the F2 generation is considered, and the options are various ratios. From my earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio across all four phenotypes would be 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D, but none of the options match this directly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within a specific phenotype group, such as all red, or all brown, etc. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:P, 6:B, 3:C, 1:D?

But none of the options say 9:3:3:1. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which seems incorrect. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12 parts. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar to our 9:3:3:1 but reversed. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. Option F is uniform. None of these directly match 9:3:3:1 except for option C, which lists 9,3,3,1 as the counts, but option C states \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" This aligns with our calculation, so option C would be correct. However, the options do not have 9:3:3:1, but option C does list the numbers.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having both traits is the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\nFor C:\n- Probability of C present: 1 (since any C makes C dominant)\nWait, no\u2014no, wait: For the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC (red), Cc (pigeon), cc (plain). So the probability of having C present is 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n- Probability of B present: 3/4 (since BB, Bb, Bb).\n\nSince these are independent, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThe probability of having only C (and not B) is (number of C without B) / total. From the F2, the number of birds with C but not B: These are the birds who have C (3/4) but not B (1/4). So the probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only B (and not C) is also 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of having neither is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be:\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nNow, converting these to a ratio: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Yes, that matches option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Instead of thinking in terms of the probability of having the trait, I'll look at the possible combinations:",
    "rollout": " Instead of thinking in terms of the probability of having the trait, I'll look at the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for each trait, the presence of a dominant allele leads to the expression of that trait. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n2. C present, B absent: Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered)\n3. C absent, B present: Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown)\n4. Both C and B absent: Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered)\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype, we can use a grid. For each gene, the probability of being dominant is 3/4, and recessive is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (both dominant): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (only C dominant): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (only B dominant): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (neither dominant): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems off because according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype 4, which is 1/16, while plain red would be Phenotype 3, which is 3/16. But none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.6,2,6,2\n\nL.4,4,4,4\n\nM.12,2,2,0\n\nN.5,3,2,6\n\nO.3,9,1,3\n\nP.4,4,4,4\n\nQ.1,3,9,3\n\nR.7,5,1,3\n\nS.5,3,2,6\n\nT.3,9,1,3\n\nU.6,2,6,2\n\nV.4,4,4,4\n\nW.12,2,2,0\n\nX.5,3,2,6\n\nY.7,5,1,3\n\nZ.3,9,1,3\n\nWait, option K is \"12,2,2,0\" which would mean checkered red:12, checkered brown:2, plain red:2, plain brown:0. But according to our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options directly match this except option K which says 12,2,2,0. Hmm, but why are the numbers different?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment color, and c is recessive for that trait. Additionally, B is dominant for brown color, and b is recessive. So the possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B are:\n\n- Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: checkered red\n- Pigment red (C present) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: checkered brown\n- Plain (c) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain brown\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds that fall into each category. Assuming a large population, the distribution follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So, 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. Option K is \"12,2,2,0,\" which sums to 16, whereas the total should be 20 (assuming 5 generations or something else). Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the F2 generation as a result of selfing a homozygous bird. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb. F1 selfing would lead to F2 with the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nBut then, for phenotypes, it's a bit more complex because each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. However, if we consider only the dominant traits, the phenotypic ratios can still follow 9:3:3:1. So the total number of checkered red (phenotype 1) would be 9 parts, checkered brown (phenotype 2) 3, plain red (phenotype 3) 3, and plain brown (phenotype 4) 1. \n\nLooking at the options again, none seem to directly reflect this. Option G mentions 12,2,2,0, which adds up to 16. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which also adds up to 16. Maybe the user intended to represent the phenotypic counts differently, perhaps considering the number of birds with each trait. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different approach. Let me try calculating the exact numbers.\n\nAssuming a large population of F2 birds, each bird's genotype is equally likely among the 20 possible combinations (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and there are two genes). The phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, so:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 1): 9/16 of the population\n- Checkered brown (phenotype 2): 3/16\n- Plain red (phenotype 3): 3/16\n- Plain brown (phenotype 4): 1/16\n\nIf the population size is 16, then checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But none of the options match this. However, looking at the options again, option K is \"12,2,2,0,\" which seems inconsistent unless the problem is considering only one allele for each gene, leading to different ratios. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach, such as counting each bird's contribution to the next generation without considering the exact probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, and the correct answer isn't listed. But given the options, the closest matching ratio is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that doesn't align with our earlier analysis. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to represent the count of each phenotype separately, but without considering dominance properly. For instance, if each bird can only exhibit one trait due to incomplete dominance, the ratios change.\n\nWait, the problem states that C controls pigment color (dominant red, recessive plain), and B controls color (dominant brown, recessive checkered). So, for each bird, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. Therefore, a bird could have both traits (pigment red and brown) or none, depending on the alleles. So the phenotypic ratios remain 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match this. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which seems too high for checkered red. Option G is 12,2,2,0 as well. Perhaps the user miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the total number of each phenotype across all generations, but that complicates things further.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user confused the F2 generation with the first generation. Let me reconsider the initial setup. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is CcBb. Then, F1 selfing produces F2 with 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: C present \u2192 red (regardless of B)\n- Cc: C present \u2192 red\n- cc: c \u2192 plain\n- bb: B present \u2192 brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC or Cc \u2192 red (regardless of B)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Only if C is present and B is present \u2192 (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: Only if C is present and B is absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: Only if C is absent and B is present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: Only if C is absent and B is absent \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Still, none of the options match exactly. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which is double what we expect. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering only one trait per bird, ignoring dominance, but that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nGiven this confusion, I might have to choose the closest available option. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which could imply that 9+3=12 for checkered red and brown, and 3+1=4 for plain red and brown, but that doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different method, such as counting each bird's contribution to the next generation, but that wouldn't change the overall ratios significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the correct dominance ratios, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't directly represented in the options. However, if we sum the checkered red (9 + 3 = 12) and checkered brown (3) and plain red (3) and plain brown (1), totaling 16 birds, then option K (12,2,2,0) seems incorrect because it assumes that some phenotypes don't occur. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered only one trait per bird, leading to different ratios. Without further information, I might have to select option G, which is 12:2:2:0, possibly representing a different approach or rounding.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of thinking in terms of the probability of having the trait, I'll look at the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for each trait, the presence of a dominant allele leads to the expression of that trait. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n2. C present, B absent: Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered)\n3. C absent, B present: Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown)\n4. Both C and B absent: Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered)\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype, we can use a grid. For each gene, the probability of being dominant is 3/4, and recessive is 1/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (both dominant): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (only C dominant): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (only B dominant): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (neither dominant): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that seems off because according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype 4, which is 1/16, while plain red would be Phenotype 3, which is 3/16. But none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.6,2,6,2\n\nL.4,4,4,4\n\nM.12,2,2,0\n\nN.5,3,2,6\n\nO.3,9,1,3\n\nP.4,4,4,4\n\nQ.1,3,9,3\n\nR.7,5,1,3\n\nS.5,3,2,6\n\nT.3,9,1,3\n\nU.6,2,6,2\n\nV.4,4,4,4\n\nW.12,2,2,0\n\nX.5,3,2,6\n\nY.7,5,1,3\n\nZ.3,9,1,3\n\nWait, option K is \"12,2,2,0\" which would mean checkered red:12, checkered brown:2, plain red:2, plain brown:0. But according to our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options directly match this except option K which says 12,2,2,0. Hmm, but why are the numbers different?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment color, and c is recessive for that trait. Additionally, B is dominant for brown color, and b is recessive. So the possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B are:\n\n- Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: checkered red\n- Pigment red (C present) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: checkered brown\n- Plain (c) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain brown\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds that fall into each category. Assuming a large population, the distribution follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So, 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. Option K is \"12,2,2,0,\" which sums to 16, whereas the total should be 20 (assuming 5 generations or something else). Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the F2 generation as a result of selfing a homozygous bird. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb. F1 selfing would lead to F2 with the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nBut then, for phenotypes, it's a bit more complex because each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. However, if we consider only the dominant traits, the phenotypic ratios can still follow 9:3:3:1. So the total number of checkered red (phenotype 1) would be 9 parts, checkered brown (phenotype 2) 3, plain red (phenotype 3) 3, and plain brown (phenotype 4) 1. \n\nLooking at the options again, none seem to directly reflect this. Option G mentions 12,2,2,0, which adds up to 16. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which also adds up to 16. Maybe the user intended to represent the phenotypic counts differently, perhaps considering the number of birds with each trait. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different approach. Let me try calculating the exact numbers.\n\nAssuming a large population of F2 birds, each bird's genotype is equally likely among the 20 possible combinations (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and there are two genes). The phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, so:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 1): 9/16 of the population\n- Checkered brown (phenotype 2): 3/16\n- Plain red (phenotype 3): 3/16\n- Plain brown (phenotype 4): 1/16\n\nIf the population size is 16, then checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But none of the options match this. However, looking at the options again, option K is \"12,2,2,0,\" which seems inconsistent unless the problem is considering only one allele for each gene, leading to different ratios. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach, such as counting each bird's contribution to the next generation without considering the exact probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, and the correct answer isn't listed. But given the options, the closest matching ratio is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that doesn't align with our earlier analysis. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to represent the count of each phenotype separately, but without considering dominance properly. For instance, if each bird can only exhibit one trait due to incomplete dominance, the ratios change.\n\nWait, the problem states that C controls pigment color (dominant red, recessive plain), and B controls color (dominant brown, recessive checkered). So, for each bird, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. Therefore, a bird could have both traits (pigment red and brown) or none, depending on the alleles. So the phenotypic ratios remain 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match this. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which seems too high for checkered red. Option G is 12,2,2,0 as well. Perhaps the user miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the total number of each phenotype across all generations, but that complicates things further.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user confused the F2 generation with the first generation. Let me reconsider the initial setup. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is CcBb. Then, F1 selfing produces F2 with 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: C present \u2192 red (regardless of B)\n- Cc: C present \u2192 red\n- cc: c \u2192 plain\n- bb: B present \u2192 brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC or Cc \u2192 red (regardless of B)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Only if C is present and B is present \u2192 (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: Only if C is present and B is absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: Only if C is absent and B is present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: Only if C is absent and B is absent \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Still, none of the options match exactly. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which is double what we expect. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering only one trait per bird, ignoring dominance, but that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nGiven this confusion, I might have to choose the closest available option. Option K is 12,2,2,0, which could imply that 9+3=12 for checkered red and brown, and 3+1=4 for plain red and brown, but that doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different method, such as counting each bird's contribution to the next generation, but that wouldn't change the overall ratios significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the correct dominance ratios, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't directly represented in the options. However, if we sum the checkered red (9 + 3 = 12) and checkered brown (3) and plain red (3) and plain brown (1), totaling 16 birds, then option K (12,2,2,0) seems incorrect because it assumes that some phenotypes don't occur. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered only one trait per bird, leading to different ratios. Without further information, I might have to select option G, which is 12:2:2:0, possibly representing a different approach or rounding.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nThe combined phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C present AND B present \u2192 red and brown (prob: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16)\nPhenotype 2: C present AND B absent \u2192 red and checkered (prob: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16)\nPhenotype 3: C absent AND B present \u2192 plain and brown (prob: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16)\nPhenotype 4: Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered (prob: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16)\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers by multiplying by 16 (the denominator):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nTotal = 16.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each gene has a 75% chance of being present (for the C locus, 75% have C; for B locus, 75% have B). Since the genes are independent, the probability that both are present is 75% * 75% = 56.25%, i.e., 9/16. The probability that only C is present is 75% * 25% = 18.75%, i.e., 3/16. Similarly, only B is present is 25% * 75% = 18.75%, i.e., 3/16. And neither is present is 25% * 25% = 6.25%, i.e., 1/16. So now, translating back to the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16 of the birds\nPhenotype B: Only C present \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: Only B present \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options given:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our calculation: 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo the answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird has two independent traits. The number of possible phenotypic classes is 2^2=4, but each class combines the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nFor C:\n- Presence: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Absence: 1/4\n\nFor B:\n- Presence: 3/4\n- Absence: 1/4\n\nThe probability of a bird having both traits (C and B present) is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having only C (B absent) is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nOnly B (C absent) is also 3/16.\n\nNeither (both absent) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, but arranged according to the classes. Now, translating this into the given options, let's look back at what was asked. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which seems off because none of the classes are zero. Option H says 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option E has a different distribution.

Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is half of our ratio. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

For red only (no B), it's (prob C) * (prob not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, brown only (no C) is also 3/16. And none (both not present) is (1/4)^2 = 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the chance of having C is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C), similarly for B. But the actual presence of the trait depends on dominance. So for a bird to have red (C) and brown (B), both must be present. The probability of having both traits is (prob C) * (prob B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. For red only (no B), it's (prob C) * (prob not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, brown only (no C) is also 3/16. And none (both not present) is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be: 9:3:3:1. But wait, the options given don't include 9:3:3:1.

In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present.",
    "rollout": " Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. For the C locus: 3/4 chance of being C (phenotype red), 1/4 chance of being c (plain). For the B locus: 3/4 chance of B (phenotype brown), 1/4 chance of b (checkered). Since these are independent, the combined probability is:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B and not C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Adding up, that makes 16 parts, which matches the denominator of our probabilities.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given (A to H), let's compare them:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 which adds up to 16, but according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16 but is reversed. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12, so that's wrong. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16 but follows a different pattern. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is the reverse of our 9:3:3:1. So none of the options match exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's double-check the calculations. Perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let's clarify: - Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body color brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by both traits. So, for each bird, the presence of C and B will determine the phenotype. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. not C and B \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which is correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G has Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our calculation shows that checkered (which is when C is not present) has a higher frequency than plain (when both C and B are not present).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a different order. Let me list the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOur calculation shows that the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly reflect this, except perhaps option C, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, plain red corresponds to the case where both C and B are not present, which is 1/16 of the population, while checkered red is when C is not present but B is present, which is 3/16. Similarly, plain brown is when B is not present but C is present, which is 3/16, and checkered brown is when neither C nor B is present, which is 1/16.\n\nSo checking option C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no\u2014because checkered red should be 3/16 * 16 = 3 parts, and plain red is 1 part. Checkered brown is 3 parts, and plain brown is 1 part. So yes, option C's numbers add up to 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, matching option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. For the C locus: 3/4 chance of being C (phenotype red), 1/4 chance of being c (plain). For the B locus: 3/4 chance of B (phenotype brown), 1/4 chance of b (checkered). Since these are independent, the combined probability is:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B and not C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Adding up, that makes 16 parts, which matches the denominator of our probabilities.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given (A to H), let's compare them:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 which adds up to 16, but according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16 but is reversed. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12, so that's wrong. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16 but follows a different pattern. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is the reverse of our 9:3:3:1. So none of the options match exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's double-check the calculations. Perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let's clarify: - Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body color brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by both traits. So, for each bird, the presence of C and B will determine the phenotype. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. not C and B \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which is correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G has Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our calculation shows that checkered (which is when C is not present) has a higher frequency than plain (when both C and B are not present).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a different order. Let me list the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOur calculation shows that the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly reflect this, except perhaps option C, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, plain red corresponds to the case where both C and B are not present, which is 1/16 of the population, while checkered red is when C is not present but B is present, which is 3/16. Similarly, plain brown is when B is not present but C is present, which is 3/16, and checkered brown is when neither C nor B is present, which is 1/16.\n\nSo checking option C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no\u2014because checkered red should be 3/16 * 16 = 3 parts, and plain red is 1 part. Checkered brown is 3 parts, and plain brown is 1 part. So yes, option C's numbers add up to 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, matching option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The possible ways a bird can have both C and B dominant are:\n\n- C dominant and B dominant: This happens when at least one C and at least one B allele are present.\nThe number of such genotypes is (number of genotypes with C) minus those without B plus (those with B) minus those with neither.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that a bird has at least one C allele is 3/4, and similarly for B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The probability of a bird having both C and B dominant is the probability that at least one C allele is present AND at least one B allele is present. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B)\n\nBut actually, it's easier to compute it directly. The possible ways a bird can have both C and B dominant are:\n\n- C dominant and B dominant: This happens when at least one C and at least one B allele are present.\nThe number of such genotypes is (number of genotypes with C) minus those without B plus (those with B) minus those with neither.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that a bird has at least one C allele is 3/4, and similarly for B. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having exactly one dominant trait:\n\n- Only C: 3/4 (for C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3/4\n- Only B: 3/4 (for B dominant, C recessive) \u2192 3/4\n\nAnd the probability of having neither: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\nPhenotype A (both traits): 9/16\nPhenotype B (only C): 3/16\nPhenotype C (only B): 3/16\nPhenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts based on a certain number of individuals. Assuming a population size of 16 (a common denominator):\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 individuals\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Instead of thinking in terms of the bird's expression, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.",
    "rollout": " Instead of thinking in terms of the bird's expression, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square analysis:\n\nEach F2 bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both C and B: Phenotype A\n- C only: Phenotype B\n- B only: Phenotype C\n- Neither C nor B: Phenotype D\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can look at the F2 genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n1. BB (25%)\n2. Bb (50%)\n3. bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 This requires at least one C and at least one B allele. So the possible genotypes are CcBb, CcBB, Ccbb, and CC_Bb (wait, no\u2014it's more precise to list all combinations where both C and B are present).\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, we can calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor the C locus: The probability of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly for B: 3/4. Since the loci are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for both traits being present. Therefore, Phenotype A occurs 9/16 of the time.\n\nFor Phenotype B (only C present, B absent): This requires that the bird has at least one C allele but no B alleles. So the possible genotypes are Cc (for C) and bb (for B). But wait, since B is recessive, bb would mean the bird has no B alleles. So the genotypes would be CcBB (no, wait\u2014if B is absent, then the bird's B alleles are recessive, i.e., bb). And Cc would come from the C locus. So the possible genotypes are Cc (for C) and bb (for B). So the probability is (number of Cc) * (number of bb). Since Cc is 50% and bb is 25%, the probability is 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 1/8. Therefore, Phenotype B is 1/8 of the population.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype C (only B present, C absent): This is the same logic but reversed. The bird has at least one B allele (so B present) and no C alleles (so C absent). So the possible genotypes are CC (no C) and Bb (for B). Wait, no\u2014since C is absent, the bird has no C alleles (so CC), and for B, it needs to have at least one B allele (so Bb or BB). But since B is dominant, having at least one B allele means Bb or BB. However, since we're looking for only B present, the presence of B is required, but C is absent. So the probability is (prob of CC) * (prob of B present). Wait, no\u2014this seems confusing. Let me clarify. Phenotype C occurs when the bird has at least one B allele (so B present) and no C alleles (so C absent). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc (no C, so Cc cannot have C absent; wait, no\u2014Cc would have C, so that's not correct. Wait, Cc means one C and one c, so for C absent, the bird must have two c alleles. So the only way to have C absent is to have cc. So for Phenotype C, the bird must have cc (no C alleles) and at least one B allele (either B or Bb or BB). But since B is dominant, having at least one B allele means Bb or BB. Therefore, the probability is (prob of cc) * (prob of B present). Prob of cc is 25% (since 25% cc, 50% Cc, 25% CC). Wait, no: The F2 generation has four possible genotypes for each gene, but we're combining them across both genes. Alternatively, to calculate Phenotype C, which is only B present (C absent):\n\nThe bird must have:\n\n- At least one B allele (so B present)\n- No C alleles (so C absent)\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc (can't be, because Cc has C)\n- cc (which is C absent)\n- Bb (has B)\n- BB (has B)\n\nBut for Phenotype C, the bird must have C absent (so cc) and B present (so Bb or BB). So the probability is (prob of cc) * (prob of B present). Prob of cc is 25% (from the C locus). Prob of B present is 3/4 (since B is dominant, any B allele makes the bird have B). Therefore, Phenotype C is 25% * 75% = 18.75%, which is 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype D (neither C nor B present): This requires the bird to have no C alleles and no B alleles. So the genotype is ccbb. The probability is (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% or 1/16.\n\nNow, adding up the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n- Phenotype B: 1/8 = 2/16 \u2248 12.5%\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 = 6.25%\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 15 parts out of 16, which accounts for the entire population. So the ratios are approximately 56.25% A, 12.5% B, 18.75% C, and 6.25% D.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none directly match this exact breakdown. Let me review the options given:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of these options exactly match our calculated ratios. However, option G shows a different distribution: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. Our calculation showed 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Option H shows 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown. Option E shows 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. None seem to match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the probabilities. Maybe the way I counted the phenotypes was incorrect. Another approach is to create a Punnett square showing all possible combinations and mapping them to phenotypes. Here's a table:\n\n| F1 \u00d7 F1 | Genotype | Phenotype |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| CB \u00d7 CB | CcBb    | Phenotype A (both traits present) |\n| CB \u00d7 cb | CcBb    | Phenotype A |\n| cb \u00d7 CB | CcBb    | Phenotype A |\n| cb \u00d7 cb | ccbb    | Phenotype D (neither trait present) |\n\nWait, but each F2 bird has four possible genotypes, which correspond to four phenotypes. So let's list all four possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but that's only four genotypes. Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square has four possible combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible genotypes. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, using the probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C present, B absent: 1/8 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B present, C absent: 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThis gives us the ratios 9:A, 2:B, 3:C, 1:D. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that's not matching. Option F has checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Not matching. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option G is 12,2,2,0. None of these match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the answer to be option E, but according to my calculations, the correct ratio isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me try a different approach. Using the fact that each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the combinations of the two traits.\n\nFor the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC (red), Cc (pigment), and cc (plain). For B locus, BB (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (checkered). Combining these, we get:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red and brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red and brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red and checkered\n4. CC bb \u2192 red and checkered (Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously.)\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotype is a combination of the two. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 all have pigment red and brown.\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 these have pigment red but checkered.\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 these have checkered and brown.\n- Phenotype D: neither present \u2192 cc bb \u2192 plain and checkered.\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal possible genotypes: 16.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: CcBb and CcBb \u2192 2 (from CcBb) and 2 (from ccBb?) Wait, no. Let me list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n7. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n11. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n12. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n13. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n16. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nWait, this approach is getting too cumbersome. Instead, let's note that for each gene, the phenotypic ratios are 3:1. For two independent genes, the combined ratios are 9:3:3:1 for the four possible phenotypic categories. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (B present, C absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. Converting this to counts in a 16-bird population:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equally represented, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Which matches 3 Phenotype A, 9 Phenotype B, 1 Phenotype C, 3 Phenotype D. Wait, no, because according to the calculation, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1, and Phenotype A is 9. So the counts would be 9,3,3,1. But option E has Phenotype A as 3, which contradicts our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the options. Looking back:\n\nOptions are labeled A to J, with each option providing a different ratio. The correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the closest option is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is similar but inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio to be presented in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which would be 9,3,3,1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. That's the inverse of what we have. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No. Option F:4,4,4,4\u2192No. Option I:7,5,1,3\u2192No. Option J:2,6,3,9\u2192No. So none match exactly. However, perhaps the user intended the options differently, or I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation.\n\nWait, going back, the F1 is CcBb. When crossed with CcBb, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- For each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Each with 25% chance.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n\nWait, no, this approach is error-prone. Instead, knowing that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes, the counts would be divided accordingly. For a total of 16 birds, Phenotype A (9) would occur 9 times, Phenotype B (3) 3 times, Phenotype C (3) 3 times, and Phenotype D (1) once. \n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to Phenotype B (3), Phenotype A (9), Phenotype C (3), Phenotype D (1). But according to the F2 ratio, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. So option E presents Phenotype B as 9, which is inconsistent. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratio. However, perhaps the user intended the options differently, and the correct answer is option E, despite the discrepancy in the order. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F2 generation does not follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question specifies that both genes are codominant, which typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio under complete dominance. Therefore, I believe the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the closest is option E, but it's inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking again:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich would imply:\n\nCheckered red:3\n\nCheckered brown:9\n\nPlain red:1\n\nPlain brown:3\n\nWhich is consistent with Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. So the order is wrong in the option, but the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of thinking in terms of the bird's expression, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square analysis:\n\nEach F2 bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both C and B: Phenotype A\n- C only: Phenotype B\n- B only: Phenotype C\n- Neither C nor B: Phenotype D\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can look at the F2 genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n1. BB (25%)\n2. Bb (50%)\n3. bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 This requires at least one C and at least one B allele. So the possible genotypes are CcBb, CcBB, Ccbb, and CC_Bb (wait, no\u2014it's more precise to list all combinations where both C and B are present).\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, we can calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor the C locus: The probability of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). Similarly for B: 3/4. Since the loci are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for both traits being present. Therefore, Phenotype A occurs 9/16 of the time.\n\nFor Phenotype B (only C present, B absent): This requires that the bird has at least one C allele but no B alleles. So the possible genotypes are Cc (for C) and bb (for B). But wait, since B is recessive, bb would mean the bird has no B alleles. So the genotypes would be CcBB (no, wait\u2014if B is absent, then the bird's B alleles are recessive, i.e., bb). And Cc would come from the C locus. So the possible genotypes are Cc (for C) and bb (for B). So the probability is (number of Cc) * (number of bb). Since Cc is 50% and bb is 25%, the probability is 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 1/8. Therefore, Phenotype B is 1/8 of the population.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype C (only B present, C absent): This is the same logic but reversed. The bird has at least one B allele (so B present) and no C alleles (so C absent). So the possible genotypes are CC (no C) and Bb (for B). Wait, no\u2014since C is absent, the bird has no C alleles (so CC), and for B, it needs to have at least one B allele (so Bb or BB). But since B is dominant, having at least one B allele means Bb or BB. However, since we're looking for only B present, the presence of B is required, but C is absent. So the probability is (prob of CC) * (prob of B present). Wait, no\u2014this seems confusing. Let me clarify. Phenotype C occurs when the bird has at least one B allele (so B present) and no C alleles (so C absent). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc (no C, so Cc cannot have C absent; wait, no\u2014Cc would have C, so that's not correct. Wait, Cc means one C and one c, so for C absent, the bird must have two c alleles. So the only way to have C absent is to have cc. So for Phenotype C, the bird must have cc (no C alleles) and at least one B allele (either B or Bb or BB). But since B is dominant, having at least one B allele means Bb or BB. Therefore, the probability is (prob of cc) * (prob of B present). Prob of cc is 25% (since 25% cc, 50% Cc, 25% CC). Wait, no: The F2 generation has four possible genotypes for each gene, but we're combining them across both genes. Alternatively, to calculate Phenotype C, which is only B present (C absent):\n\nThe bird must have:\n\n- At least one B allele (so B present)\n- No C alleles (so C absent)\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc (can't be, because Cc has C)\n- cc (which is C absent)\n- Bb (has B)\n- BB (has B)\n\nBut for Phenotype C, the bird must have C absent (so cc) and B present (so Bb or BB). So the probability is (prob of cc) * (prob of B present). Prob of cc is 25% (from the C locus). Prob of B present is 3/4 (since B is dominant, any B allele makes the bird have B). Therefore, Phenotype C is 25% * 75% = 18.75%, which is 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype D (neither C nor B present): This requires the bird to have no C alleles and no B alleles. So the genotype is ccbb. The probability is (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% or 1/16.\n\nNow, adding up the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n- Phenotype B: 1/8 = 2/16 \u2248 12.5%\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 = 6.25%\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 15 parts out of 16, which accounts for the entire population. So the ratios are approximately 56.25% A, 12.5% B, 18.75% C, and 6.25% D.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none directly match this exact breakdown. Let me review the options given:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of these options exactly match our calculated ratios. However, option G shows a different distribution: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. Our calculation showed 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Option H shows 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown. Option E shows 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. None seem to match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the probabilities. Maybe the way I counted the phenotypes was incorrect. Another approach is to create a Punnett square showing all possible combinations and mapping them to phenotypes. Here's a table:\n\n| F1 \u00d7 F1 | Genotype | Phenotype |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| CB \u00d7 CB | CcBb    | Phenotype A (both traits present) |\n| CB \u00d7 cb | CcBb    | Phenotype A |\n| cb \u00d7 CB | CcBb    | Phenotype A |\n| cb \u00d7 cb | ccbb    | Phenotype D (neither trait present) |\n\nWait, but each F2 bird has four possible genotypes, which correspond to four phenotypes. So let's list all four possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but that's only four genotypes. Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square has four possible combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible genotypes. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, using the probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C present, B absent: 1/8 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B present, C absent: 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThis gives us the ratios 9:A, 2:B, 3:C, 1:D. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that's not matching. Option F has checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Not matching. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option G is 12,2,2,0. None of these match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the answer to be option E, but according to my calculations, the correct ratio isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me try a different approach. Using the fact that each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the combinations of the two traits.\n\nFor the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC (red), Cc (pigment), and cc (plain). For B locus, BB (brown), Bb (brown), and bb (checkered). Combining these, we get:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red and brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red and brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red and checkered\n4. CC bb \u2192 red and checkered (Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes simultaneously.)\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotype is a combination of the two. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 all have pigment red and brown.\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 these have pigment red but checkered.\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 these have checkered and brown.\n- Phenotype D: neither present \u2192 cc bb \u2192 plain and checkered.\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal possible genotypes: 16.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: CcBb and CcBb \u2192 2 (from CcBb) and 2 (from ccBb?) Wait, no. Let me list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n7. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n11. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n12. ccBb \u2192 Phenotype D\n13. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n16. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nWait, this approach is getting too cumbersome. Instead, let's note that for each gene, the phenotypic ratios are 3:1. For two independent genes, the combined ratios are 9:3:3:1 for the four possible phenotypic categories. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (B present, C absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. Converting this to counts in a 16-bird population:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equally represented, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Which matches 3 Phenotype A, 9 Phenotype B, 1 Phenotype C, 3 Phenotype D. Wait, no, because according to the calculation, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1, and Phenotype A is 9. So the counts would be 9,3,3,1. But option E has Phenotype A as 3, which contradicts our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the options. Looking back:\n\nOptions are labeled A to J, with each option providing a different ratio. The correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the closest option is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is similar but inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio to be presented in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which would be 9,3,3,1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. That's the inverse of what we have. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No. Option F:4,4,4,4\u2192No. Option I:7,5,1,3\u2192No. Option J:2,6,3,9\u2192No. So none match exactly. However, perhaps the user intended the options differently, or I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation.\n\nWait, going back, the F1 is CcBb. When crossed with CcBb, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- For each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Each with 25% chance.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n\nWait, no, this approach is error-prone. Instead, knowing that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes, the counts would be divided accordingly. For a total of 16 birds, Phenotype A (9) would occur 9 times, Phenotype B (3) 3 times, Phenotype C (3) 3 times, and Phenotype D (1) once. \n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to Phenotype B (3), Phenotype A (9), Phenotype C (3), Phenotype D (1). But according to the F2 ratio, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. So option E presents Phenotype B as 9, which is inconsistent. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratio. However, perhaps the user intended the options differently, and the correct answer is option E, despite the discrepancy in the order. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F2 generation does not follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question specifies that both genes are codominant, which typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio under complete dominance. Therefore, I believe the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the closest is option E, but it's inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking again:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich would imply:\n\nCheckered red:3\n\nCheckered brown:9\n\nPlain red:1\n\nPlain brown:3\n\nWhich is consistent with Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. So the order is wrong in the option, but the",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

    "rollout": " For each bird, the probability of having pigment red is 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of cases), and the probability of having brown is also 3/4.

Similarly, the probability of having only red (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16, having only brown (no C) is (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the other trait is absent. For example, if a bird has C present but B absent, then it has red pigment but checkered body. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C present (B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B present (C absent): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo now, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having pigment red is 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of cases), and the probability of having brown is also 3/4. But since these are independent, the probability of having both traits is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only red (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16, having only brown (no C) is (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the other trait is absent.

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The number of possible combinations for the F2 generation is 4 x 4 = 16 possible phenotypic outcomes.",
    "rollout": " The number of possible combinations for the F2 generation is 4 x 4 = 16 possible phenotypic outcomes. Each outcome corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes. Let's list them:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we look at how many of the 16 possible outcomes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nFor Phenotype A (both C and B present):\n- Number of outcomes: 3 (for C: 25%, 50%, 25% \u2192 3/4; similarly for B: 3/4. So combined, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16)\n\nPhenotype B (only C present, B absent):\n- Number of outcomes: 1 (C: 25%, B: bb \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let me instead count the possible combinations. For each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (pigeon)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nThe combinations of these are:\n\n1. CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. Cc (pigeon) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc (pigeon) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc (pigeon) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo counting Phenotype A: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 Total of 8 cases. Phenotype B: Case 6 \u2192 1 case. Phenotype C: Case 6 is already counted under B. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype C is only when C is absent and B is present. Looking back, Phenotype C is when C is cc and B is present, i.e., when B is present but C is absent. Which would be case 6: Cc (no C present?) Wait, no\u2014case 6 is Cc (which has C present) and bb (B absent). So Phenotype C would be when C is absent (cc) and B is present (Bb or BB). Looking at the list above, Phenotype C occurs in case 6: Cc (with C present) and bb (without B). Wait, no\u2014Phenotype C is when C is absent (cc) and B is present (either BB or Bb). Looking at the list, case 6 is Cc (has C present) and bb (has B absent). That's Phenotype B. So Phenotype C occurs in cases where C is absent (cc) and B is present (either BB or Bb). Looking at our cases:\n\nCase 6: Cc (has C) and bb (has B) \u2192 Phenotype B\nOther cases where C is cc and B is present:\n\nLooking through the list, cases where C is cc (cases 7,8,9):\n\n- Case 7: cc (no C) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Case 8: cc (no C) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Case 9: cc (no C) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, Phenotype C only occurs when C is cc and B is present (BB or Bb). From the list, that happens in cases 7,8, and 9. Wait, but in our earlier count, Phenotype A includes cases 7,8,9 (where C is cc and B is present). So Phenotype C is when C is cc and B is present, which is 3 cases (7,8,9). Phenotype B is when C is present (cases 1,2,3,4,5) and B is absent (case 6). Phenotype D is when both are absent (case 9 is D, but others like case 9 may not fit). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to create a grid of all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and each gene is inherited independently, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B are present.\nProbability = (Probability C present) * (Probability B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent.\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present.\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present.\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nTo convert these fractions into counts based on a population size, say N, the numbers would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9N/16\n- Phenotype B: 3N/16\n- Phenotype C: 3N/16\n- Phenotype D: N/16\n\nBut looking at the options given, they seem to provide the phenotypic ratio without specifying the total population size. They probably expect the ratio of Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype C : Phenotype D.\n\nSo Phenotype A is 9 parts, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, and Phenotype D is 1. Adding them up gives 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:1 \u2192 No, seems too low.\n\nB. 8:4:0\u2192 Not matching.\n\nC.9:3:3:1 \u2192 Yes, matches our calculation.\n\nD.2:6:3\u2192 No.\n\nE.3:9:1\u2192 No.\n\nF.4:4:4\u2192 No.\n\nG.12:2\u2192 No.\n\nH.5:3\u2192 No.\n\nI.7:5\u2192 No.\n\nSo option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible combinations for the F2 generation is 4 x 4 = 16 possible phenotypic outcomes. Each outcome corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes. Let's list them:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we look at how many of the 16 possible outcomes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nFor Phenotype A (both C and B present):\n- Number of outcomes: 3 (for C: 25%, 50%, 25% \u2192 3/4; similarly for B: 3/4. So combined, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16)\n\nPhenotype B (only C present, B absent):\n- Number of outcomes: 1 (C: 25%, B: bb \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let me instead count the possible combinations. For each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (pigeon)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nThe combinations of these are:\n\n1. CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. Cc (pigeon) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc (pigeon) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc (pigeon) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo counting Phenotype A: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 Total of 8 cases. Phenotype B: Case 6 \u2192 1 case. Phenotype C: Case 6 is already counted under B. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype C is only when C is absent and B is present. Looking back, Phenotype C is when C is cc and B is present, i.e., when B is present but C is absent. Which would be case 6: Cc (no C present?) Wait, no\u2014case 6 is Cc (which has C present) and bb (B absent). So Phenotype C would be when C is absent (cc) and B is present (Bb or BB). Looking at the list above, Phenotype C occurs in case 6: Cc (with C present) and bb (without B). Wait, no\u2014Phenotype C is when C is absent (cc) and B is present (either BB or Bb). Looking at the list, case 6 is Cc (has C present) and bb (has B absent). That's Phenotype B. So Phenotype C occurs in cases where C is absent (cc) and B is present (either BB or Bb). Looking at our cases:\n\nCase 6: Cc (has C) and bb (has B) \u2192 Phenotype B\nOther cases where C is cc and B is present:\n\nLooking through the list, cases where C is cc (cases 7,8,9):\n\n- Case 7: cc (no C) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Case 8: cc (no C) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Case 9: cc (no C) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, Phenotype C only occurs when C is cc and B is present (BB or Bb). From the list, that happens in cases 7,8, and 9. Wait, but in our earlier count, Phenotype A includes cases 7,8,9 (where C is cc and B is present). So Phenotype C is when C is cc and B is present, which is 3 cases (7,8,9). Phenotype B is when C is present (cases 1,2,3,4,5) and B is absent (case 6). Phenotype D is when both are absent (case 9 is D, but others like case 9 may not fit). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to create a grid of all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and each gene is inherited independently, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B are present.\nProbability = (Probability C present) * (Probability B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent.\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present.\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present.\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nTo convert these fractions into counts based on a population size, say N, the numbers would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9N/16\n- Phenotype B: 3N/16\n- Phenotype C: 3N/16\n- Phenotype D: N/16\n\nBut looking at the options given, they seem to provide the phenotypic ratio without specifying the total population size. They probably expect the ratio of Phenotype A : Phenotype B : Phenotype C : Phenotype D.\n\nSo Phenotype A is 9 parts, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, and Phenotype D is 1. Adding them up gives 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:1 \u2192 No, seems too low.\n\nB. 8:4:0\u2192 Not matching.\n\nC.9:3:3:1 \u2192 Yes, matches our calculation.\n\nD.2:6:3\u2192 No.\n\nE.3:9:1\u2192 No.\n\nF.4:4:4\u2192 No.\n\nG.12:2\u2192 No.\n\nH.5:3\u2192 No.\n\nI.7:5\u2192 No.\n\nSo option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype can be thought of as a combination of the two genes. For the C locus: 25% C (red), 50% Cc (pigeon), 25% cc (plain). For the B locus: 25% B (brown), 50% Bb (brown), 25% bb (checkered). The combined phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n- Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the probabilities of each gene and then combining them.\n\nFor Phenotype A (both present):\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 25% C, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 75% C)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Since independent, combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B (only C present):\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C (only B present):\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D (neither present):\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nSimplifying, multiply numerator by 16 to get integer counts:\n\n9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C present, B absent): Probability = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B present, C absent): Probability = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither present): Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, to convert these fractions into ratios, we multiply each by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none match exactly. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nEtc.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the chance of having C is 3/4, and the chance of having B is 3/4. Since the presence of each is independent, the probability of having both is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of having only C is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Only B is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Neither is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Wait, but that sums up to 9+3+3+1=16 parts. Yes, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C present): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B present): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither present): 1/16\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Hmm, seems off.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation: Phenotype A (Red Brown): 9/16, which would correspond to 9 in a population of 16, but looking at the options, option C says 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014this aligns.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match our 9 vs 1.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, we have 9,3, etc.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9, B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. Option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches exactly.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible phenotypic classes is 4, but the actual distribution depends on the probabilities of each gene. Alternatively, using a Punnett square, each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two genes. The total number of phenotypic classes is 4: A, B, C, D. Now, the probabilities are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C present: 3/4\n- C absent: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B present: 3/4\n- B absent: 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo:\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts based on a population size. Suppose we have N individuals in the F2 generation. Then:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9N/16\n- Phenotype B: 3N/16\n- Phenotype C: 3N/16\n- Phenotype D: N/16\n\nTo get the ratios in whole numbers, we can scale up. Multiply each by 16:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird can have four possible genotypic combinations: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. But we need to map these to phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each phenotype in the F2. Let me do that.\n\nIn F2, for each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 3 dominant (C) and 1 recessive (c)\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 3 dominant (B) and 1 recessive (b)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations where each trait is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each class are calculated as follows:\n\nClass 1 (both C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nClass 2 (only C present): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nClass 3 (only B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nClass 4 (neither present): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding up, 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 No\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Yes\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 No\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Reverse order\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 All same, not our case\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 No\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 No\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 No\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 No\n\nSo option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

That doesn't match our calculation.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Hmm, that's 4 each, which matches our 9+3+3+1=16, but split as 9+3+3+1=16, so 9,3,3,1. None of the options exactly match this except option H, but H is different.\nWait, looking again: Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No, that doesn't add up to 16. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Looking at the options, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, let me look again. The options provided were labeled A to J, but the user presented them as A, B,..., J, each with a different ratio. So I need to pick the correct one. Based on our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, perhaps option H is correct. Wait, checking option H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which would be 9,3,3,1. None of the options perfectly match this. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb. Then F2 is produced by selfing F1. In F2, what phenotypes do we get?\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A (9/16)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B (3/16)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C (3/16)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype D (1/16)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts of A, 3 parts of B, 3 parts of C, and 1 part of D. \n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. However, perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding the number of offspring. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to our analysis, it's 9:3:3:1. Among the options provided, none directly match this. However, option H states: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which also sums to 16. This doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Another possibility is that I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene is required for the phenotype. So, for a bird to be Phenotype A (red and brown), both C and B must be present. The probability of C is 1 (since any C allele gives red), and the probability of B is 1 (since any B allele gives brown). So the probability of Phenotype A is 1*1=1, but that can't be right because all birds would have both traits if they have at least one C and one B allele. However, that's not possible because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb, which when crossed, would produce F2 with varying ratios. Wait, perhaps the issue is that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene is considered separately, but the phenotypic expression combines both traits. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9/(9+3+3+1) = 9/16 chance for A, 3/16 for B, etc. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking at the options again, option H seems to have 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to 3:3:3:3, which would be Phenotype A:3, B:3, C:3, D:3, summing to 12. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, but among the options given, option H is the closest, although it's not matching our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider. The problem statement says the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares of that. The phenotypic ratio in F2 should indeed be 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none match this exactly. The closest is option H, but it's 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. Maybe the question intended to ask about a different scenario, such as dominance without complete dominance, but that's unlikely here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have each gene segregating independently. So for the C locus: possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, CB. For the B locus: same. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n       | Cc  | cB  | cb  | cc\n-------|-----|-----|-----|----\n CB     | CC  | Cc  | Cc  | Cc\n cb     | Cc  | cc  | cc  | cc\n cb     | Cc  | cc  | cc  | cc\n cc     | Cc  | cc  | cc  | cc\n```\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because each parent produces gametes, and the Punnett square should reflect all combinations. The correct approach is to list all possible combinations. Each gene has four possibilities, so the Punnett square would be 4x4, totaling 16 possible combinations. Let's list them:\n\n1. Cc \u00d7 Cc: All combinations (assuming random segregation)\n2. Cc \u00d7 cc: Only Cc and cc can occur.\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each genotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Frequency of C: (number of C alleles)/(total alleles) = (3/4 C alleles)\n- Frequency of c: 1/4 c alleles\n\nSame for the B locus:\n- Frequency of B: 3/4\n- Frequency of b: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Cc: (3/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(3/4) = 6/16\n- cc: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: (3/4)^2 = 9/16\n- Bb: 2*(3/4)(1/4) = 6/16\n- bb: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nNow, for each bird, their phenotype depends on both C and B:\n\n- Pheno A (C and B): 9/16\n- Pheno B (C and b): 6/16 / 2 = 3/16\n- Pheno C (c and B): 6/16 / 2 = 3/16\n- Pheno D (c and b): 1/16\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 9+6+6+1=18, which is more than 16. I think I'm making a mistake here. Instead, each combination of C and B has a certain probability, which then translates to a phenotype. So:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): (9/16) * (9/16) = Not applicable. Wait, no. The probability of each phenotype is calculated based on the combination of C and B.\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B (C and b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C (c and B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nThis doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. It seems none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps option H is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question and it's expecting a different approach. \n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2. \n\nGiven the options, I think the correct answer is option H, but upon closer examination, it doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nParents: CC BB and cc bb. F1 is CcBb, F2 is the squares of CcBb. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options provided. However, option H is the closest, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong, but given the choices, I have to choose the best fit. \n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that option H is the only one that sums to 16, but it's 5,3,2,6, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps option H is intended to be the correct answer despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation, not F2. Let me check the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, it specifies F2. Therefore, my previous conclusion stands: the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which does not exactly match any of the options. However, option H is the only one that sums to 16, but it's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option H is the closest, though it's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not their ratio. If that's the case, let's recalculate the counts.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 9\n- Cc: 6\n- cc: 1\n\nBut phenotypically, these correspond to:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B): 9\n- Phenotype B (C and b): 6\n- Phenotype C (c and B): 6\n- Phenotype D (c and b): 1\n\nWait, no, because the counts should be divided by the total of 16. So Phenotype A: 9/16, B:6/16, C:6/16, D:1/16. So the phenotype counts are 9,6,6,1. Adding up to 16.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nNone of the options exactly match 9:6:6:1. However, option H is 5:3:2:6, which adds to 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question was referring to a different scenario, such as dominant and recessive without complete dominance, but that's not indicated here.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is not listed, but if forced to choose from the given options, option H might be intended to be correct despite the mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16. Therefore, the phenotype counts are 9,3,3,1. None of the options match this exactly, but option H is the only one that adds up to 16. However, option H's numbers don't align with this ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not available, but since I have to choose, I'll select option H as the closest, acknowledging the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, after careful consideration, I realize that none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option H is the most plausible choice, albeit with inaccuracies. Therefore, I'll proceed with selecting option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The correct way is to consider the probability that a bird has C present and B present, C present and B absent, C absent and B present, and C absent and B absent.\n\nFor C present (phenotype C or A):\n- Probability = 3/4 (since any C allele makes the bird have C)\nFor B present (phenotype A or C):\n- Probability = 3/4\n\nSo the combined probability of both being present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of C present and B absent (A only):\n- Probability = (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nThe probability of C absent and B present (C only):\n- Probability = (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nAnd the probability of neither (both absent):\n- (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, translating these to phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A (both present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, or 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match our calculation.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Hmm, that's 4 each, which matches our 9+3+3+1=16, but split as 9+3+3+1=16, so 9,3,3,1. None of the options exactly match this except option H, but H is different.\nWait, looking again: Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No, that doesn't add up to 16. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Looking at the options, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, let me look again. The options provided were labeled A to J, but the user presented them as A, B,..., J, each with a different ratio. So I need to pick the correct one. Based on our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, perhaps option H is correct. Wait, checking option H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which would be 9,3,3,1. None of the options perfectly match this. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb. Then F2 is produced by selfing F1. In F2, what phenotypes do we get?\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A (9/16)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B (3/16)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C (3/16)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype D (1/16)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts of A, 3 parts of B, 3 parts of C, and 1 part of D. \n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. However, perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding the number of offspring. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to our analysis, it's 9:3:3:1. Among the options provided, none directly match this. However, option H states: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which also sums to 16. This doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Another possibility is that I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene is required for the phenotype. So, for a bird to be Phenotype A (red and brown), both C and B must be present. The probability of C is 1 (since any C allele gives red), and the probability of B is 1 (since any B allele gives brown). So the probability of Phenotype A is 1*1=1, but that can't be right because all birds would have both traits if they have at least one C and one B allele. However, that's not possible because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb, which when crossed, would produce F2 with varying ratios. Wait, perhaps the issue is that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene is considered separately, but the phenotypic expression combines both traits. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9/(9+3+3+1) = 9/16 chance for A, 3/16 for B, etc. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking at the options again, option H seems to have 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to 3:3:3:3, which would be Phenotype A:3, B:3, C:3, D:3, summing to 12. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, but among the options given, option H is the closest, although it's not matching our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider. The problem statement says the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares of that. The phenotypic ratio in F2 should indeed be 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none match this exactly. The closest is option H, but it's 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. Maybe the question intended to ask about a different scenario, such as dominance without complete dominance, but that's unlikely here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have each gene segregating independently. So for the C locus: possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, CB. For the B locus: same. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n       | Cc  | cB  | cb  | cc\n-------|-----|-----|-----|----\n CB     | CC  | Cc  | Cc  | Cc\n cb     | Cc  | cc  | cc  | cc\n cb     | Cc  | cc  | cc  | cc\n cc     | Cc  | cc  | cc  | cc\n```\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because each parent produces gametes, and the Punnett square should reflect all combinations. The correct approach is to list all possible combinations. Each gene has four possibilities, so the Punnett square would be 4x4, totaling 16 possible combinations. Let's list them:\n\n1. Cc \u00d7 Cc: All combinations (assuming random segregation)\n2. Cc \u00d7 cc: Only Cc and cc can occur.\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each genotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Frequency of C: (number of C alleles)/(total alleles) = (3/4 C alleles)\n- Frequency of c: 1/4 c alleles\n\nSame for the B locus:\n- Frequency of B: 3/4\n- Frequency of b: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Cc: (3/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(3/4) = 6/16\n- cc: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: (3/4)^2 = 9/16\n- Bb: 2*(3/4)(1/4) = 6/16\n- bb: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nNow, for each bird, their phenotype depends on both C and B:\n\n- Pheno A (C and B): 9/16\n- Pheno B (C and b): 6/16 / 2 = 3/16\n- Pheno C (c and B): 6/16 / 2 = 3/16\n- Pheno D (c and b): 1/16\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 9+6+6+1=18, which is more than 16. I think I'm making a mistake here. Instead, each combination of C and B has a certain probability, which then translates to a phenotype. So:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): (9/16) * (9/16) = Not applicable. Wait, no. The probability of each phenotype is calculated based on the combination of C and B.\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B (C and b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C (c and B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nThis doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. It seems none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps option H is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question and it's expecting a different approach. \n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2. \n\nGiven the options, I think the correct answer is option H, but upon closer examination, it doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nParents: CC BB and cc bb. F1 is CcBb, F2 is the squares of CcBb. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options provided. However, option H is the closest, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong, but given the choices, I have to choose the best fit. \n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that option H is the only one that sums to 16, but it's 5,3,2,6, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps option H is intended to be the correct answer despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation, not F2. Let me check the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, it specifies F2. Therefore, my previous conclusion stands: the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which does not exactly match any of the options. However, option H is the only one that sums to 16, but it's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option H is the closest, though it's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not their ratio. If that's the case, let's recalculate the counts.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 9\n- Cc: 6\n- cc: 1\n\nBut phenotypically, these correspond to:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B): 9\n- Phenotype B (C and b): 6\n- Phenotype C (c and B): 6\n- Phenotype D (c and b): 1\n\nWait, no, because the counts should be divided by the total of 16. So Phenotype A: 9/16, B:6/16, C:6/16, D:1/16. So the phenotype counts are 9,6,6,1. Adding up to 16.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nNone of the options exactly match 9:6:6:1. However, option H is 5:3:2:6, which adds to 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question was referring to a different scenario, such as dominant and recessive without complete dominance, but that's not indicated here.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is not listed, but if forced to choose from the given options, option H might be intended to be correct despite the mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16. Therefore, the phenotype counts are 9,3,3,1. None of the options match this exactly, but option H is the only one that adds up to 16. However, option H's numbers don't align with this ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not available, but since I have to choose, I'll select option H as the closest, acknowledging the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, after careful consideration, I realize that none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option H is the most plausible choice, albeit with inaccuracies. Therefore, I'll proceed with selecting option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each gene, the probability of having the dominant allele is:",
    "rollout": " For each gene, the probability of having the dominant allele is:\n\nFor the C locus: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait, no\u2014all birds will have at least one C allele. So for C, presence is always 100%, so the probability is 1. Similarly, for B, presence is always 100%, so 1. But this seems contradictory because if both genes are always dominant, then all birds would have both traits. That can't be right. Wait, no\u2014I'm making a mistake here. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for a bird to have both traits, they need to have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Since all parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1 is also homozygous for each gene, leading to all F2 birds being homozygous for each gene. Therefore, all F2 birds have both traits expressed. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for both traits, meaning all individuals have both red and brown. But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, no\u2014I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So for a bird to have both traits, they must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Given that all parents are homozygous for each gene (e.g., CC BB), all F1 and F2 will inherit CC and BB, leading to all F2 being CcBb. Therefore, all F2 will have both traits expressed. Wait, but that doesn't align with typical dihybrid crosses. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem setup. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for each gene. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So both C and c affect the color. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive c allele. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the genes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Gene C: controls pigment color\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- Gene B: controls body color\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. So the presence of c (recessive) causes the checkered pattern, while B (dominant) causes brown. Wait, that's different from what I initially thought. So, the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of at least one dominant C allele.\n- Brown: presence of at least one dominant B allele.\n- Checkered: presence of recessive c allele.\n- Plain: presence of recessive c allele for both genes?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the expression of that trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: at least one C allele (C_: 3/4)\n- Brown: at least one B allele (B_: 3/4)\n- Checkered: both c alleles (cc): 1/4\n- Plain: both c alleles (cc): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of these traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and cc)\n3. Plain and brown (cc and B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and cc)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_):\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and cc):\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown (cc and B_):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and cc):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into counts based on the number of offspring. Assuming a large population, the ratio would be approximately 9:3:3:1. However, in reality, it's often rounded to 9:6:1 or similar depending on the exact method used.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G mentions a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, totaling 16.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of having the dominant allele is:\n\nFor the C locus: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait, no\u2014all birds will have at least one C allele. So for C, presence is always 100%, so the probability is 1. Similarly, for B, presence is always 100%, so 1. But this seems contradictory because if both genes are always dominant, then all birds would have both traits. That can't be right. Wait, no\u2014I'm making a mistake here. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for a bird to have both traits, they need to have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Since all parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1 is also homozygous for each gene, leading to all F2 birds being homozygous for each gene. Therefore, all F2 birds have both traits expressed. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for both traits, meaning all individuals have both red and brown. But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, no\u2014I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So for a bird to have both traits, they must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Given that all parents are homozygous for each gene (e.g., CC BB), all F1 and F2 will inherit CC and BB, leading to all F2 being CcBb. Therefore, all F2 will have both traits expressed. Wait, but that doesn't align with typical dihybrid crosses. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem setup. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for each gene. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So both C and c affect the color. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive c allele. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the genes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Gene C: controls pigment color\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- Gene B: controls body color\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. So the presence of c (recessive) causes the checkered pattern, while B (dominant) causes brown. Wait, that's different from what I initially thought. So, the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of at least one dominant C allele.\n- Brown: presence of at least one dominant B allele.\n- Checkered: presence of recessive c allele.\n- Plain: presence of recessive c allele for both genes?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the expression of that trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: at least one C allele (C_: 3/4)\n- Brown: at least one B allele (B_: 3/4)\n- Checkered: both c alleles (cc): 1/4\n- Plain: both c alleles (cc): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of these traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and cc)\n3. Plain and brown (cc and B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and cc)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_):\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and cc):\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown (cc and B_):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and cc):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into counts based on the number of offspring. Assuming a large population, the ratio would be approximately 9:3:3:1. However, in reality, it's often rounded to 9:6:1 or similar depending on the exact method used.\n\nLooking back at the options given, option G mentions a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, totaling 16. Wait, that matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Hmm, none seem to match exactly, but let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations and count them according to the phenotypes.\n\nEach bird can be categorized as follows based on their C and B alleles:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigmented red (since C is present)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigmented red\n6.

C c \u2192 Pigmented red\n7. c c \u2192 Plain brown\n8. c c \u2192 Plain brown\n9. c c \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but that counts incorrectly. Let me recount properly. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. Let me list all possible combinations for C and B, along with their phenotypes.\n\nPossible C alleles: C, C, c, c\nPossible B alleles: B, B, B, b\n\nCombinations:\n\n1. C C (Pigmented red) and B B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C C (Pigmented red) and B B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. C C (Pigmented red) and B b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n4.

The closest option is H, which states a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the principles. Wait, let me verify the calculations once more.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach for F2:\n\nEach parent is CcBb, so the F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (4:4 ratio)\n2.

Cc bb (1:1 ratio)\n7. cc BB (1:1 ratio)\n8. cc Bb (1:1 ratio)\n9. cc bb (1:1 ratio)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird will have two traits, so the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So for each bird, if C is present, they are Pigmented red. If B is present, they are Brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether C and/or B are present.\n\nLet's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2.

Let me recount:\n\nWait, each bird's genotype is a combination of C and B. For example, CC BB \u2192 C and B both dominant \u2192 Phenotype A. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. cc BB \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D. cc Bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nSo now, the counts are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2,3,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:3, which simplifies to 1:1:1. But that's not matching any of the given options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene independently. So for each bird, if either gene has a dominant allele, they exhibit that trait, otherwise not. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: C is present OR B is present (or both)\n- Phenotype B: C is present AND B is NOT present\n- Phenotype C: C is NOT present AND B is present\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B is present\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,4,5 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2,3,6 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype C: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype D: None \u2192 0\n\nWhich again gives a 3:3:3:0 ratio. But looking at the options, the closest one is H, which has a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but the user specified F2.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the 3:3:3:0 ratio, but perhaps I made an error in considering dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that both traits are expressed regardless of dominance, leading to a different outcome. This is getting complicated, and I think I need to proceed with the best available answer based on standard Mendelian ratios.\n\nIn the standard scenario where both traits are expressed, the phenotypic ratio would typically be 9:3:3:1 for two linked genes. However, in this case, since the genes are independent, the ratio should be 3:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, none have this. Wait, option H has a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but perhaps that's not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering only one trait per bird, but that doesn't fit the description.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user may have mixed up the ratios, and the correct answer isn't among the choices. However, since the options don't include a 3:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer is H, which has a different ratio. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the principles. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll go with the most plausible answer based on typical Mendelian ratios, even though it doesn't perfectly align with the given options. Perhaps the intended answer was H, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the initial analysis. Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is option H, but I'm not fully confident. \n\nHowever, upon reviewing the Punnett square and the F2 analysis, the correct ratio should be 3:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, I might have erred in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to F1 phenotypes rather than F2. If that were the case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2, leading to a 1:1 ratio, but that still doesn't align with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different scenario, but without further clarification, I'll have to choose the closest option based on standard assumptions. Given the confusion, I think the intended answer is H, despite discrepancies. However, I'm uncertain. Ultimately, I believe the correct ratio should be 3:3:3:1, which isn't among the options, indicating a possible error in the provided choices.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird has two traits, and each trait is expressed based on the presence of dominant alleles. So for each gene, the probability of being present is:\n\nFor C: 3/4 (since 1/4 cc)\nFor B: 3/4 (since 1/4 bb)\n\nThe combined probability of having both traits is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nHaving only C (and not B): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\nHaving only B (and not C): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\nHaving neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option H says \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which doesn't match our calculation. Option E says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which also doesn't match. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which seems off. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, none seem to match exactly, but let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations and count them according to the phenotypes.\n\nEach bird can be categorized as follows based on their C and B alleles:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigmented red (since C is present)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigmented red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. Let me reevaluate. For each bird:\n\nIf C is present (C_), then they are Pigmented red.\nIf B is present (B_), then they are Brown.\nIf both are present, they are Phenotype A (red and brown).\nElse, Phenotype B (red and checkered) or Phenotype C (plain and brown), or Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nSo, counting each bird:\n\n1. C C \u2192 Pigmented red\n2. C C \u2192 Pigmented red\n3. C c \u2192 Pigmented red (since C is present)\n4. C c \u2192 Pigmented red\n5. C c \u2192 Pigmented red\n6. C c \u2192 Pigmented red\n7. c c \u2192 Plain brown\n8. c c \u2192 Plain brown\n9. c c \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but that counts incorrectly. Let me recount properly. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. Let me list all possible combinations for C and B, along with their phenotypes.\n\nPossible C alleles: C, C, c, c\nPossible B alleles: B, B, B, b\n\nCombinations:\n\n1. C C (Pigmented red) and B B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C C (Pigmented red) and B B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. C C (Pigmented red) and B b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. C c (Pigmented red) and B B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. C c (Pigmented red) and B b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n6. C c (Pigmented red) and B b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. c c (Plain brown) and B B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. c c (Plain brown) and B b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n9. c c (Plain brown) and B b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Cases 1,2,4,7 \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Cases 3,5,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:3:1:1, which simplifies to 4:3:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly reflect this ratio. The closest option is H, which states a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the principles. Wait, let me verify the calculations once more.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach for F2:\n\nEach parent is CcBb, so the F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (4:4 ratio)\n2. CC Bb (2:2 ratio)\n3. CC bb (1:1 ratio)\n4. Cc BB (2:2 ratio)\n5. Cc Bb (1:1 ratio)\n6. Cc bb (1:1 ratio)\n7. cc BB (1:1 ratio)\n8. cc Bb (1:1 ratio)\n9. cc bb (1:1 ratio)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird will have two traits, so the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So for each bird, if C is present, they are Pigmented red. If B is present, they are Brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether C and/or B are present.\n\nLet's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc BB \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier counts. Let me recount:\n\nWait, each bird's genotype is a combination of C and B. For example, CC BB \u2192 C and B both dominant \u2192 Phenotype A. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B. cc BB \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D. cc Bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nSo now, the counts are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2,3,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype D: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:3, which simplifies to 1:1:1. But that's not matching any of the given options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene independently. So for each bird, if either gene has a dominant allele, they exhibit that trait, otherwise not. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: C is present OR B is present (or both)\n- Phenotype B: C is present AND B is NOT present\n- Phenotype C: C is NOT present AND B is present\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B is present\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,4,5 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype B: Cases 2,3,6 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype C: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype D: None \u2192 0\n\nWhich again gives a 3:3:3:0 ratio. But looking at the options, the closest one is H, which has a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but the user specified F2.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the 3:3:3:0 ratio, but perhaps I made an error in considering dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that both traits are expressed regardless of dominance, leading to a different outcome. This is getting complicated, and I think I need to proceed with the best available answer based on standard Mendelian ratios.\n\nIn the standard scenario where both traits are expressed, the phenotypic ratio would typically be 9:3:3:1 for two linked genes. However, in this case, since the genes are independent, the ratio should be 3:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, none have this. Wait, option H has a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but perhaps that's not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering only one trait per bird, but that doesn't fit the description.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user may have mixed up the ratios, and the correct answer isn't among the choices. However, since the options don't include a 3:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer is H, which has a different ratio. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the principles. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll go with the most plausible answer based on typical Mendelian ratios, even though it doesn't perfectly align with the given options. Perhaps the intended answer was H, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the initial analysis. Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is option H, but I'm not fully confident. \n\nHowever, upon reviewing the Punnett square and the F2 analysis, the correct ratio should be 3:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, I might have erred in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to F1 phenotypes rather than F2.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

Therefore, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, or 100% divided equally among the four phenotypes. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are labeled A through J, each giving different ratios. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nThe problem states that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio is to be determined. From our analysis, each phenotype appears at 25%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 18, which doesn't fit\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16, which also doesn't fit\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16, which fits if each is 4, but our calculation shows each at 25%, i.e., 4 each out of 16. Wait, but that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the presence of dominant alleles doesn't lead to the same probability. Let me recalculate. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C and b \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. c and B \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. c and b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these requires that at least one dominant allele exists in each gene. So for each bird, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability of Phenotype A: (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nProbability of Phenotype B: (Probability of C) * (Probability of b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nProbability of Phenotype C: (Probability of c) * (Probability of B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nProbability of Phenotype D: (Probability of c) * (Probability of b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but this seems higher than what I thought earlier. So 9 parts Phenotype A, 3 parts each of B, C, D. So the total is 16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014because in the problem, the F2 generation refers to the entire bird population, so each part corresponds to each phenotype. So Phenotype A: checkered red (C and B) \u2192 9 parts\nPhenotype B: checkered brown (C and b) \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype C: plain red (c and B) \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype D: plain brown (c and b) \u2192 1 part\n\nBut the options don't directly list this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches our calculation perfectly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Using a Punnett square for the F2:\n\nThe F2 will have four possible genotypes for each gene, but combined. Let me create the Punnett square:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parents are Cc, so possible gametes are C and c.\n- Same for B locus.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypic classes are based on whether each gene is dominant. So for each bird, the phenotype is:\n- Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can count the number of each genotype in the F2:\n\nNumber of Phenotype A (CC BB): 25%\nNumber of Phenotype B (CC Bb): 25%\nNumber of Phenotype C (cc BB): 25%\nNumber of Phenotype D (cc Bb): 25%\n\nSo each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 population. Therefore, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, or 100% divided equally among the four phenotypes. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are labeled A through J, each giving different ratios. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nThe problem states that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio is to be determined. From our analysis, each phenotype appears at 25%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 18, which doesn't fit\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16, which also doesn't fit\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16, which fits if each is 4, but our calculation shows each at 25%, i.e., 4 each out of 16. Wait, but that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the presence of dominant alleles doesn't lead to the same probability. Let me recalculate. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C and b \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. c and B \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. c and b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these requires that at least one dominant allele exists in each gene. So for each bird, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability of Phenotype A: (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nProbability of Phenotype B: (Probability of C) * (Probability of b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nProbability of Phenotype C: (Probability of c) * (Probability of B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nProbability of Phenotype D: (Probability of c) * (Probability of b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but this seems higher than what I thought earlier. So 9 parts Phenotype A, 3 parts each of B, C, D. So the total is 16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014because in the problem, the F2 generation refers to the entire bird population, so each part corresponds to each phenotype. So Phenotype A: checkered red (C and B) \u2192 9 parts\nPhenotype B: checkered brown (C and b) \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype C: plain red (c and B) \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype D: plain brown (c and b) \u2192 1 part\n\nBut the options don't directly list this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches our calculation perfectly. So the correct answer should be option D.\n\nHowever, wait, the initial problem mentions \"the checkered red bird\" and \"the plain brown bird.\" So checkered red is phenotype A (C and B), checkered brown is B (C and b), plain red is C (c and B), and plain brown is D (c and b). So the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

From the Punnett square for two loci, each gene contributing 3 possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele), leading to 3 x 3 = 9 phenotypic classes. But wait, in reality, the number reduces because some phenotypes may overlap. For example, if both C and B are present, the phenotype is red and brown. If only C is present, it's red and checkered. Only B is present: plain and brown. Neither: plain and checkered. So the possible phenotypic ratios are:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nRed and Brown | (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nRed and Checkered | (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPlain and Brown | (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPlain and Checkered | (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, translating this into the options given, the problem asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of looking at the combined probabilities, perhaps it's easier to list all possible phenotypes and their counts in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square for two loci, each gene contributing 3 possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele), leading to 3 x 3 = 9 phenotypic classes. But wait, in reality, the number reduces because some phenotypes may overlap. For example, if both C and B are present, the phenotype is red and brown. If only C is present, it's red and checkered. Only B is present: plain and brown. Neither: plain and checkered. So the possible phenotypic ratios are:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nRed and Brown | (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nRed and Checkered | (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPlain and Brown | (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPlain and Checkered | (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, translating this into the options given, the problem asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking back at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which seems off because our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Let me confirm the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum to 16, but our ratio is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16, but our ratio is different.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 fits our calculation.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 inverse, unlikely.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 also unlikely.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 all equal, which doesn't match.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum is 16, but our ratio is 9:3:3:1.\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B traits.\n\nPossible Combinations:\n\n1. C and B: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. C and b: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n3. c and B: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n4. c and b: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probability of each combination:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present.\n  - Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C)\n  - Probability of B present: 3/4\n  - Since they are independent, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype B: Only C present (and B absent).\n  - Probability of C present: 3/4\n  - Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since 1/4 of the birds don't have B)\n  - Total: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C: Only B present (and C absent).\n  - Probability of B present: 3/4\n  - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n  - Total: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present.\n  - Probability of C absent: 1/4\n  - Probability of B absent: 1/4\n  - Total: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nWhich simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Yes, matches our result.\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each trait:\n\n- For pigment color (C): 3/4 (dominant) and 1/4 (recessive)\n- For body color (B): 3/4 (dominant) and 1/4 (recessive)\n\nSince both traits are determined by independent genes, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nThe number of phenotypic classes is 4: AA BB, AA bb, aa BB, aa bb, where A is dominant for pigment, B is dominant for color. Wait, no, the classes are:\n\n1. Aa Bb (both dominant)\n2. Aa bb (only B dominant)\n3. aa Ab (only C dominant)\n4. aa bb (neither dominant)\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n1. Aa Bb: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Aa bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. aa Ab: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. aa bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. Aa Bb \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. Aa bb \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. aa Ab \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. aa bb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, or 9 parts red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red (which would be the 3:3 part?), but looking at the options:\n\nLet me re-examine the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2013 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn\u2019t match.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes, matches what we've deduced.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 No.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 No.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2013 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2013 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2013 No.\n\nSo option G is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with our calculation.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The number of possible phenotypes is four, and each is equally likely under independence.",
    "rollout": " The number of possible phenotypes is four, and each is equally likely under independence. So the probability distribution is uniform across the four phenotypes. Therefore, each phenotype has a 25% chance. But that contradicts our earlier calculation. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nFor the C locus: Each bird has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant C (i.e., red), and a 25% chance of having none (plain). Similarly, for the B locus: 75% have brown, 25% have checkered. Since these are independent, the probability of a bird having both traits is (0.75)(0.75) = 0.5625, having only C is (0.75)(0.25) = 0.1875, having only B is (0.25)(0.75) = 0.1875, and having neither is (0.25)^2 = 0.0625. So the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when scaled up by 16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options provided, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That seems different from what I'm calculating. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c. So, the checkered birds are homozygous recessive (cc). Plain is dominant (C). Pigmentation is determined by B: brown (dominant) and checkered (recessive). So, when a bird has at least one dominant allele for both traits, it will have both colors. Otherwise, it won't. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. Not C and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. Neither \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, none directly match this. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which sums to 16, but according to this, all four phenotypes are present. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16 as well. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation, considering the dihybrid cross. Let me reconsider the initial setup.\n\nThe initial parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb (dihybrid). When F1 selfs (to get F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor each gene:\n- C: C C, C c, c c (probabilities 25%, 50%, 25%)\n- B: B B, B b, b b (same probabilities)\n\nTherefore, the F2 for each gene is:\n\nC: 3/4 C, 1/4 c\nB: 3/4 B, 1/4 b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each bird are:\n\nTotal phenotypes: 4 (as discussed before).\n\nEach phenotype's probability is:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the answer choices exactly match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 5+3+2+6=16. This matches our total phenotypes. But why does it have checkered red and checkered brown with higher numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio after considering the actual counts, assuming Mendelian inheritance. Each bird has four possible combinations of alleles, but due to dominance, some phenotypes may not be expressed fully. However, in reality, each bird expresses one or the other phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. So, in terms of phenotypic expression, all four phenotypes are present in the F2 generation, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But since the options don't include this exact ratio, perhaps the intended answer is H, which distributes the total count across the phenotypes as 5,3,2,6, adding up to 16. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the relative frequency without accounting for dominance, leading to a different ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the distribution among the checkered and plain birds separately. For instance, the number of checkered birds (both c) versus plain birds (none c). In the F2 generation, the number of checkered birds would be the sum of checkered red and checkered brown, which is 5 + 3 = 8. The number of plain birds would be 3 (red plain) + 1 (brown plain) = 4. So the ratio would be 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, and the answer options expect us to identify which one fits. Among the options given, only H adds up to 16, matching the total number of possible phenotypes. Therefore, despite the confusion, I believe the correct answer is H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible phenotypes is four, and each is equally likely under independence. So the probability distribution is uniform across the four phenotypes. Therefore, each phenotype has a 25% chance. But that contradicts our earlier calculation. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nFor the C locus: Each bird has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant C (i.e., red), and a 25% chance of having none (plain). Similarly, for the B locus: 75% have brown, 25% have checkered. Since these are independent, the probability of a bird having both traits is (0.75)(0.75) = 0.5625, having only C is (0.75)(0.25) = 0.1875, having only B is (0.25)(0.75) = 0.1875, and having neither is (0.25)^2 = 0.0625. So the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when scaled up by 16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options provided, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That seems different from what I'm calculating. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c. So, the checkered birds are homozygous recessive (cc). Plain is dominant (C). Pigmentation is determined by B: brown (dominant) and checkered (recessive). So, when a bird has at least one dominant allele for both traits, it will have both colors. Otherwise, it won't. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. Not C and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. Neither \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, none directly match this. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which sums to 16, but according to this, all four phenotypes are present. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16 as well. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation, considering the dihybrid cross. Let me reconsider the initial setup.\n\nThe initial parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb (dihybrid). When F1 selfs (to get F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor each gene:\n- C: C C, C c, c c (probabilities 25%, 50%, 25%)\n- B: B B, B b, b b (same probabilities)\n\nTherefore, the F2 for each gene is:\n\nC: 3/4 C, 1/4 c\nB: 3/4 B, 1/4 b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each bird are:\n\nTotal phenotypes: 4 (as discussed before).\n\nEach phenotype's probability is:\n\n- Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the answer choices exactly match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 5+3+2+6=16. This matches our total phenotypes. But why does it have checkered red and checkered brown with higher numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio after considering the actual counts, assuming Mendelian inheritance. Each bird has four possible combinations of alleles, but due to dominance, some phenotypes may not be expressed fully. However, in reality, each bird expresses one or the other phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. So, in terms of phenotypic expression, all four phenotypes are present in the F2 generation, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But since the options don't include this exact ratio, perhaps the intended answer is H, which distributes the total count across the phenotypes as 5,3,2,6, adding up to 16. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the relative frequency without accounting for dominance, leading to a different ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the distribution among the checkered and plain birds separately. For instance, the number of checkered birds (both c) versus plain birds (none c). In the F2 generation, the number of checkered birds would be the sum of checkered red and checkered brown, which is 5 + 3 = 8. The number of plain birds would be 3 (red plain) + 1 (brown plain) = 4. So the ratio would be 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, and the answer options expect us to identify which one fits. Among the options given, only H adds up to 16, matching the total number of possible phenotypes. Therefore, despite the confusion, I believe the correct answer is H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of phenotypic classes is four, each representing different combinations of the two traits. To find the proportion of each class, we can look at the possible combinations:\n\nFor each bird, the presence of C and B is independent, so the probability distribution across the four phenotypic classes can be modeled as follows:\n\nClass A (C and B present): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nClass B (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nClass C (C absent, B present): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nClass D (neither present): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Doesn\u2019t match.\nB. 6:2:4:4 \u2013 Not matching.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 Yes, matches our calculation.\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2013 Inverses of what we have.\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 Also inverses.\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 All same, which would imply all phenotypes equally likely, which isn't the case here.\nG. 12:2:2:2 \u2013 Way off.\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 Nope.\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 Still doesn't match.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio 9, 3, 3, 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird has two separate traits, so the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering each trait separately and then combining them. Alternatively, it's easier to list all possible phenotypes and count their occurrences. For the C locus, the possible genotypes and their probabilities in F2:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these. The number of combinations is 3 x 3 = 9, but many of them may overlap. However, for our purposes, we can directly assign phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n  - Probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n  - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): Occurs when both C and B are absent.\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, applying these probabilities to the given options:\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWhich corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1/16, Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3/16, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3/16, Phenotype A (red and brown): 9/16. This matches Option G: 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nSo the answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The probability of a bird having C (dominant) is 3/4, and the probability of having B (dominant) is also 3/4. Since these are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for having both traits. Similarly, the probability of having only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. So the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but the options seem different. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm. Maybe I've made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me re-express the probabilities correctly. For each bird, the chance of having both C and B is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Only C is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Only B is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Neither is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match exactly. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Which corresponds to D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, the order is checkered red (plain) 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, but in the options, the names are mixed up. Wait, no\u2014the options list the phenotypes in a certain order. Let me double-check the options.\n\nThe options are labeled from A to J, each giving a specific phenotypic ratio. Looking back at the original question, the options are presented in order, starting from A to J. The correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to checkered red (plain) 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But looking at the options provided, none directly state this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nFrom the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

CC \u00d7 CB \u2192 25% Cc\n3. CC \u00d7 cb \u2192 25% cc\n4. CB \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% Cc\n5. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 25% CB\n6. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 25% Cb\n7. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 25% Cc\n8. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 25% cc\n\nWait, no\u2014this seems complicated. Alternatively, a better way is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have the same number of each type of genotype as the F1 squared. So for each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these. For example, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50%\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nThis results in the following F2 genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nHowever, the question asks about the phenotypes, not the genotypes. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. As before, the phenotypes are A, B, C, D with counts 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't match 9:3:3:1.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nOption K: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equally represented, which doesn't align with 9:3:3:1.\nOption L: Not listed.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. For each bird, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\nPhenotype A (Red Brown): 9/16\nPhenotype B (Red Checkered): 3/16\nPhenotype C (Plain Brown): 3/16\nPhenotype D (Plain Checkered): 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16 birds, so the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G (12:2:2:0) if the numbers were divided by something, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Wait, the question states \"the F2 generation,\" so the options are all for F2. Since none match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, going back: Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when they mate, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from crossing F1 with F1. So the correct F2 genotypes would include CC, Cc, cc for each gene, leading to the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. So why are the options not matching?\n\nLooking at option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Sum is 16. 12+2+2+0=16. But according to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, which is 9+3+3+1=16. None of the options match exactly. Perhaps the original question intended a different cross, or I misread it.\n\nWait, the question says: \"...adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the F2 would indeed follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, none match perfectly. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 16 birds, but the ratio is different. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which reverses the order. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is 16, but again, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me think again. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present. So:\n\nPhenotype A (Red Brown): Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 9\nPhenotype B (Red Checkered): C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\nPhenotype C (Plain Brown): C absent, B present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\nPhenotype D (Plain Checkered): Neither present \u2192 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal 16 birds, ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Perhaps I need to reconsider the initial assumption. Is the F2 generation the result of F1 x F1, which would indeed lead to the 9:3:3:1 ratio? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are scaled down somehow. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is supposed to represent the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, but presented as fractions. So 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options exactly match, but perhaps I missed something in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. But the question clearly states F2. Another possibility is that the options are presented differently, perhaps in terms of percentages rather than ratios.\n\nWait, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, so that's not 16. Option H is 5:3:2:6, summing to 16, but the ratio is different. Option I is 7:5:1:3, sum 16, ratio different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me confirm:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none exactly match, but perhaps I should choose the closest option. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem and the correct answer is not among the choices. But since I have to select from the options, perhaps option G is the intended answer, though it doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial analysis is incorrect. Let me try another approach. Consider the F2 generation as the result of F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). The Punnett square for F2 would involve all possible combinations of the gametes:\n\nGametes from F1: CB, cb, cb, cb (assuming equal distribution)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent can produce gametes CB and cb, so F1 (CcBb) can produce four types: CB, cb, cb, cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% (for each parent producing Cc)\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent producing cc)\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50%\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent producing cc)\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nWhich results in the following F2 genotype distribution:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25% for each gene, leading to:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype A (Red Brown): 9/16 (as before)\nPhenotype B (Red Checkered): 3/16\nPhenotype C (Plain Brown): 3/16\nPhenotype D (Plain Checkered): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Comparing to the options:\n\nNone of the options exactly match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also sums to 16 but is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross was meant to be F1 x F2, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the options are based on a different approach. Let me consider the F2 generation as the squares of the F1 genotypes. F1 is CcBb. Squaring it would yield:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% (for each parent contributing Cc)\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent contributing cc)\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50%\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent contributing cc)\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus.\n\nBut again, the phenotypes remain as before. Without matching the options, perhaps the answer is not listed, but I must choose from the given options. Among the options, option G is the closest in count (16 birds) but the ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the F1 generation as the basis, but that would imply the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 3:3:1 for B and 3:1 for C, giving a total of 3:3:1:3\u21929:3:3:1. Still not matching any option except G if we consider scaling down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to pick, perhaps option J is closer.\n\nWait, no\u2014option J is 2:6:3:1, which adds to 12, which doesn't make sense for 16 birds. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which is reversed. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is 16 but all equally represented. Option L is not listed. Option M is not available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the F2 generation as F1 x F1, whereas perhaps the correct cross is F1 x F2, but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). The F1 is selfed, resulting in F2. The F2 will have the same 9:3:3:1 ratio as F1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options match exactly, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F1 generation. Let me check what the F1 phenotypic ratio is.\n\nF1 is CcBb. The F1 phenotypes are:\n\n- Cc (pigmented) and Bb (color), leading to:\n\n  - Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n  - C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n  - C absent, B present \u2192",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C present): 3/16 (since 1/4 of the birds have C but not B)\n- Phenotype C (only B present): 3/16 (since 1/4 have B but not C)\n- Phenotype D (neither present): 1/16\n\nNow, checking the options given, none of them seem to match this. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6: checkered red, 2: checkered brown, 6: plain red, 2: plain brown \u2192 Total 16 birds, ratio 6:2:6:2\nB. 8: checkered red, 4: checkered brown, 0: plain red, 4: plain brown \u2192 Ratio 8:4:0:4\nC. 9: checkered red, 3: checkered brown, 3: plain red, 1: plain brown \u2192 16 total\nD. 2: checkered red, 6: checkered brown, 3: plain red, 1: plain brown \u2192 12 total\nE. 3: checkered red, 9: checkered brown, 1: plain red, 3: plain brown \u2192 16 total\nF. 4: checkered red, 4: checkered brown, 4: plain red, 4: plain brown \u2192 16 total\nG. 12: checkered red, 2: checkered brown, 2: plain red, 0: plain brown \u2192 16 total\nH. 5: checkered red, 3: checkered brown, 2: plain red, 6: plain brown \u2192 16 total\nI. 7: checkered red, 5: checkered brown, 1: plain red, 3: plain brown \u2192 16 total\nJ. 2: checkered red, 6: checkered brown, 3: plain red, 1: plain brown \u2192 12 total\nK. 4: checkered red, 4: checkered brown, 4: plain red, 4: plain brown \u2192 16 total\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G (12:2:2:0)\u2014no, that's not matching. Wait, no\u2014my earlier thought was wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe number of birds in each category is proportional to the number of ways to achieve each condition. For the C locus, each bird has a 3/4 chance of having at least one C allele, and similarly for the B locus. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 3/4 (C) * 3/4 (B) = 9/16 \u2192 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3/4 (C) * 1/4 (not B) = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 1/4 (C) * 3/4 (B) = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1/4 (C) * 1/4 (not B) * 1/4 (not C) * 1/4 (not B) \u2192 1/16 \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 birds. Looking at the options, that matches option G (12:2:2:0) no\u2014but wait, 9:3:3:1 is different from any of the options. Wait, looking back at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but that's not matching our 9:3:3:1. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation is being considered incorrectly. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. Each parent is CcBb. They produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if each parent can produce gametes CB and cb, then the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CC\n2. CC \u00d7 CB \u2192 25% Cc\n3. CC \u00d7 cb \u2192 25% cc\n4. CB \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% Cc\n5. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 25% CB\n6. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 25% Cb\n7. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 25% Cc\n8. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 25% cc\n\nWait, no\u2014this seems complicated. Alternatively, a better way is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have the same number of each type of genotype as the F1 squared. So for each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these. For example, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50%\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nThis results in the following F2 genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nHowever, the question asks about the phenotypes, not the genotypes. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. As before, the phenotypes are A, B, C, D with counts 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Doesn't match 9:3:3:1.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nOption K: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equally represented, which doesn't align with 9:3:3:1.\nOption L: Not listed.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. For each bird, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\nPhenotype A (Red Brown): 9/16\nPhenotype B (Red Checkered): 3/16\nPhenotype C (Plain Brown): 3/16\nPhenotype D (Plain Checkered): 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16 birds, so the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G (12:2:2:0) if the numbers were divided by something, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Wait, the question states \"the F2 generation,\" so the options are all for F2. Since none match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, going back: Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when they mate, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would come from crossing F1 with F1. So the correct F2 genotypes would include CC, Cc, cc for each gene, leading to the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. So why are the options not matching?\n\nLooking at option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Sum is 16. 12+2+2+0=16. But according to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, which is 9+3+3+1=16. None of the options match exactly. Perhaps the original question intended a different cross, or I misread it.\n\nWait, the question says: \"...adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the F2 would indeed follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, none match perfectly. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 16 birds, but the ratio is different. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which reverses the order. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is 16, but again, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me think again. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present. So:\n\nPhenotype A (Red Brown): Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 9\nPhenotype B (Red Checkered): C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\nPhenotype C (Plain Brown): C absent, B present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\nPhenotype D (Plain Checkered): Neither present \u2192 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal 16 birds, ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Perhaps I need to reconsider the initial assumption. Is the F2 generation the result of F1 x F1, which would indeed lead to the 9:3:3:1 ratio? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are scaled down somehow. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is supposed to represent the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, but presented as fractions. So 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options exactly match, but perhaps I missed something in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. But the question clearly states F2. Another possibility is that the options are presented differently, perhaps in terms of percentages rather than ratios.\n\nWait, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, so that's not 16. Option H is 5:3:2:6, summing to 16, but the ratio is different. Option I is 7:5:1:3, sum 16, ratio different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me confirm:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none exactly match, but perhaps I should choose the closest option. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem and the correct answer is not among the choices. But since I have to select from the options, perhaps option G is the intended answer, though it doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial analysis is incorrect. Let me try another approach. Consider the F2 generation as the result of F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). The Punnett square for F2 would involve all possible combinations of the gametes:\n\nGametes from F1: CB, cb, cb, cb (assuming equal distribution)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent can produce gametes CB and cb, so F1 (CcBb) can produce four types: CB, cb, cb, cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% (for each parent producing Cc)\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent producing cc)\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50%\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent producing cc)\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nWhich results in the following F2 genotype distribution:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25% for each gene, leading to:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype A (Red Brown): 9/16 (as before)\nPhenotype B (Red Checkered): 3/16\nPhenotype C (Plain Brown): 3/16\nPhenotype D (Plain Checkered): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Comparing to the options:\n\nNone of the options exactly match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also sums to 16 but is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross was meant to be F1 x F2, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the options are based on a different approach. Let me consider the F2 generation as the squares of the F1 genotypes. F1 is CcBb. Squaring it would yield:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% (for each parent contributing Cc)\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent contributing cc)\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50%\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% (for each parent contributing cc)\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for the B locus.\n\nBut again, the phenotypes remain as before. Without matching the options, perhaps the answer is not listed, but I must choose from the given options. Among the options, option G is the closest in count (16 birds) but the ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the F1 generation as the basis, but that would imply the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 3:3:1 for B and 3:1 for C, giving a total of 3:3:1:3\u21929:3:3:1. Still not matching any option except G if we consider scaling down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to pick, perhaps option J is closer.\n\nWait, no\u2014option J is 2:6:3:1, which adds to 12, which doesn't make sense for 16 birds. Option E is 3:9:3:1, which is reversed. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is 16 but all equally represented. Option L is not listed. Option M is not available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the F2 generation as F1 x F1, whereas perhaps the correct cross is F1 x F2, but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). The F1 is selfed, resulting in F2. The F2 will have the same 9:3:3:1 ratio as F1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options match exactly, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F1 generation. Let me check what the F1 phenotypic ratio is.\n\nF1 is CcBb. The F1 phenotypes are:\n\n- Cc (pigmented) and Bb (color), leading to:\n\n  - Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n  - C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n  - C absent, B present \u2192",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of looking at each gene separately, we can look at each bird's phenotype:\n\nPhenotype | Probability\n--- | ---\nA (Red & Brown) | 9/16 (since 3/4 chance for C and 3/4 for B)\nB (Red & Checkered) | 3/16 (only C present)\nC (Plain & Brown) | 3/16 (only B present)\nD (Plain & Checkered) | 1/16 (neither present)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking through the choices, option G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, checking the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 nope\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2013 no\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 yes\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2013 reverse\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 reverse\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 no\nG. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 yes\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 no\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 no\n\nSo the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of the two traits. The number of possible combinations is 3 for each trait, leading to 3x3=9 possible phenotypic classes. However, some classes may overlap due to dominance. Since the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, all phenotypes where a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait will be expressed. So for each trait, the presence of a dominant allele leads to the respective trait expression. Thus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each class are calculated by determining the likelihood of each event happening. For each gene, the probability of having the dominant allele is higher than the recessive one. However, since the genes are inherited independently, we can calculate the combined probabilities.\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4 (same reasoning)\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype 2 (only C present, B absent):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since only bb)\nCombined: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (only B present, C absent):\n\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\nCombined: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (neither present, both recessive):\n\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\nCombined: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo now, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nPhenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4 = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nSimplifying by multiplying numerator terms by 16, we get 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThis adds up to 16 parts.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of a dominant trait is higher than recessive. Specifically:\n\n- For the C locus: \n  - Dominant (C): 3/4 (since any C allele makes the bird red)\n  - Recessive (c): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n  - Dominant (B): 3/4 (brown)\n  - Recessive (b): 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So the probability of a bird having both traits is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C, B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B, C absent): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither present): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The correct way is to calculate the number of possible combinations. For each bird, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio among the F2 would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which sums up to 16 parts. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option G says \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nNow, regarding the F2 generation's phenotypic distribution, each of the four classes (A, B, C, D) corresponds to different phenotypes. So the answer should reflect this ratio. Option G seems to do exactly that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So P(B present) = 3/4.\n\nThus, P(B absent) = 1/4.\n\nSo P(B) = 1/4, P(c) = 3/4.\n\nSo P(phenotype B) = P(C) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype C (C absent, B present):\n\nP(c) = 3/4, P(B present) = 3/4\n\nP(C absent) = 1/4\n\nSo P(C absent) * P(B present) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (neither C nor B present):\n\nP(c) = 3/4, P(b) = 1/4\n\nP(c) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nAdding up all phenotypes: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts based on the total number of F2 individuals.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability of having both dominant alleles is: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1? That can\u2019t be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, which isn't the case. Instead, the correct calculation considers that the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the probability of a bird expressing both traits (C and B) is 1 * 1 = 1, which again seems wrong. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead list all possible F2 phenotypes and their counts. For the F2 generation:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Probability of B: 3/4\n- Since C and B are independent, P(A) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype B (C present, B absent):\n\n- P(C) = 3/4\n- P(not B) = 1/4\n- P(B absent) = 1/4\n- P(B) = 1/4 (since 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb)\nWait, no\u2014B is present in 75% of cases because 25% BB (no B), 50% Bb (has B), 25% bb (no B). So P(B present) = 3/4.\n\nThus, P(B absent) = 1/4.\n\nSo P(B) = 1/4, P(c) = 3/4.\n\nSo P(phenotype B) = P(C) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype C (C absent, B present):\n\nP(c) = 3/4, P(B present) = 3/4\n\nP(C absent) = 1/4\n\nSo P(C absent) * P(B present) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (neither C nor B present):\n\nP(c) = 3/4, P(b) = 1/4\n\nP(c) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nAdding up all phenotypes: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts based on the total number of F2 individuals. Assuming a large population, the ratio will be:\n\nA: 9 parts\nB: 3 parts\nC: 3 parts\nD: 3 parts\n\nTotal parts: 9 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18 parts\n\nSimplifying, the ratio is 9:3:3:3, which can also be written as 3:1:1:1 (by dividing each part by 3).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of ways to get each phenotype:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 Phenotype A: 25% CC (red) + 50% Cc (red) + 25% cc (plain) = 100% red\nPhenotype B: 25% Cc (red) + 25% cc (plain) \u2192 50% red and 25% plain\nSimilarly for the B locus: Phenotype A: 25% BB (brown) + 50% Bb (brown) + 25% bb (checkered) = 100% brown\nPhenotype B: 25% Bb (brown) + 25% bb (checkered) \u2192 50% brown and 25% checkered\n\nNow, combining both loci:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by both C and B. So, we need to find the probability of each combination.\n\nClass A: Both C and B present.\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Since independent, P(A) = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nClass B: C present, B absent.\n- Probability C present: 3/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- P(B) = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nClass C: C absent, B present.\n- Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B present: 3/4\n- P(C) = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nClass D: Neither C nor B present.\n- Probability C absent: 1/4\n- Probability B absent: 1/4\n- P(D) = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:3:3:1, or dividing each by 3, 3:1:1:1/3.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

So, the chance of at least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for having both traits. Then, the probability of having only C (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B (no C) is also 3/16. Neither is 1/16. So the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nNow, translating these fractions into counts if the F2 population is large enough, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four classes I've identified.

My calculation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option C. But looking back, I realize that the phenotypic ratio should sum up to 16 parts, with 9+3+3+1=16. So option C is indeed correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having both C and B dominant is:\n\n- For the C locus: Any C allele results in red. So, the chance of at least one C allele is 3/4.\n- For the B locus: Any B allele results in brown. So, the chance of at least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for having both traits. Then, the probability of having only C (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B (no C) is also 3/16. Neither is 1/16.

From the Punnett square for F2, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but when creating the Punnett square for F2, considering the genes are independent, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes based on their combination. However, if we look at the actual F2 generation, the phenotypes would be categorized as follows:\n\n- Checkered and red: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n- Checkered and brown: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Red and brown: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Red and plain: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n\nThe exact distribution depends on the probabilities. As previously calculated, the probabilities are 9/16 for both traits, 3/16 for only one trait. Therefore, the ratio of phenotypes would be 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Both C and B: Phenotype A\n- Only C: Phenotype B\n- Only B: Phenotype C\n- Neither C nor B: Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\nFor a bird to have both C and B present:\n- C is present in 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014no, the presence of C is always present except when both alleles are c, i.e., cc. So probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, probability of having at least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of having both traits is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nProbability of having only C (no B):\n- Must have at least one C and no B.\n- So, C must be present (at least one C) and B absent (both alleles are b).\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4 (since B must be bb)\n- So combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nSimilarly, probability of having only B (no C):\n- Must have at least one B and no C.\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nProbability of having neither:\n- Must have no C and no B.\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are approximately 9:3:3:1, but wait, adding up to 16 parts, it would be:\n\nPhenotype A (both present): 9\nPhenotype B (only C): 3\nPhenotype C (only B): 3\nPhenotype D (neither): 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:2:0 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Doesn't add up to 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 This seems to fit our calculation\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2013 Inverse of our calculation\nE. 3:9:3:1 \u2013 Also inverse\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 Equal distribution\nG. 12:2:2:2 \u2013 Higher than our ratio\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 Different numbers\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 Different\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2013 Different\n\nWait, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. But let me double-check. Another way to look at it is that each gene has three possible phenotypes, but since they're inherited together, the number of phenotypic combinations is 3\u00d73=9, but due to dominance, some become mono-phenotypic. Wait, no\u2014in this case, each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the maximum number of phenotypic classes is 3 (for pigment color) \u00d7 3 (for body color) = 9, but in reality, it's fewer because some combinations don't occur. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, we have four phenotypes, not nine. Because the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones, leading to a simplified phenotypic expression. Wait, no\u2014it's still four phenotypic classes because each bird has two traits, each of which can be expressed or not, leading to four possible combinations. So the correct phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option C says 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the probabilities.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. The probability of each trait is independent. So the chance that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C leads to red), and similarly for brown. But the presence of the other gene affects the other trait. Wait, no\u2014each trait is determined separately. So the probability that a bird is red is 1 (since any C leads to red), and brown is also 1. But combined, the presence of both traits is certain, which can't be right. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, but the traits are independent. So the probability that a bird is red is 1, and the probability that a bird is brown is 1, but their combination depends on both genes. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should instead consider that the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So a bird will have both traits if it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. Otherwise, it won't have one trait. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are present. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nBut wait, that can't be right because it implies certainty. Instead, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait. So the correct way is to calculate the probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one for body.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Dominant allele (C): presence leads to red\n- Recessive (c): presence leads to plain\n\nFor body (B):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo the probability of a bird having pigment red is the probability that at least one C is present. Since the parent is CC, both alleles are C, so pigment is always red. Similarly, the parent is bb, both alleles are b, so body is always checkered. Therefore, every bird will have both traits: pigment red and checkered body. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:0:0:0. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier assumption. Perhaps the initial understanding was wrong. Let me read the question again. The problem states that the birds are involved in an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Adihybrid crosses involve crossing individuals with heterozygotes, typically for a single trait. Here, however, we're dealing with two traits controlled by two separate genes. So the adihybrid cross here is probably not the standard one used for single traits but involves the interaction of two different genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a cross between two birds with different genotypes, and the F2 generation refers to their offspring. In that case, the F2 generation would follow Mendelian inheritance, with each gene segregating independently. So, given the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for pigment and black body) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for pigment and brown body), the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. \n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc (pigment) \u00d7 Bb (body)\nWhich results in the following offspring:\n\n- 25% CC (pigment dominant, body dominant)\n- 25% Cc (pigment dominant, body recessive)\n- 25% cc (pigment recessive, body dominant)\n- 25% cc (pigment recessive, body recessive)\n\nWait, but no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but grouped by phenotypes. Let's apply the Punnett square properly.\n\nF1 is Cc Bb. The F2 will have the following genotypes for each gene:\n\n- C locus: Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- B locus: Bb (25%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes depend on both genes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Cc x Bb \u2192 16 possible offspring.\n\nEach gene is segregating independently, so the phenotypes can be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- Pigment (C): Presence of C (dominant) leads to red; otherwise, plain.\n- Body (B): Presence of B (dominant) leads to brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene's expression.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a particular combination of traits is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4 (similarly)\n- Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly:\n\nPhenotype 2 (C present, B absent):\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (C absent, B present):\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (neither C nor B present):\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible combinations is 4, each with probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B \u2192 1/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16 (since 3/4 C and 1/4 B absent)\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16 (1/4 C present and 3/4 B)\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nSo, adding up: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8 parts, but since each part corresponds to 1/16, then total is 8*(1/16)=1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting to ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1/8 (or 1:8)\n- Phenotype B: 3/8 (or 3:8)\n- Phenotype C: 3/8 (or 3:8)\n- Phenotype D: 1/8 (or 1:8)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, which simplifies to 1:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 This seems off.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match our 1:3:3:1.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Close, but our calculation shows 1:3:3:1, so 9+3+3+1=16.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also close, but our calculation is 1:3:3:1.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Incorrect.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nNone of the options exactly match 1:3:3:1, except option G, H, E, and others don't. Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the probabilities.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. The probability of each trait is independent. So the chance that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C leads to red), and similarly for brown. But the presence of the other gene affects the other trait. Wait, no\u2014each trait is determined separately. So the probability that a bird is red is 1 (since any C leads to red), and brown is also 1. But combined, the presence of both traits is certain, which can't be right. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, but the traits are independent. So the probability that a bird is red is 1, and the probability that a bird is brown is 1, but their combination depends on both genes. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should instead consider that the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So a bird will have both traits if it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. Otherwise, it won't have one trait. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are present. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nBut wait, that can't be right because it implies certainty. Instead, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait. So the correct way is to calculate the probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one for body.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Dominant allele (C): presence leads to red\n- Recessive (c): presence leads to plain\n\nFor body (B):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo the probability of a bird having pigment red is the probability that at least one C is present. Since the parent is CC, both alleles are C, so pigment is always red. Similarly, the parent is bb, both alleles are b, so body is always checkered. Therefore, every bird will have both traits: pigment red and checkered body. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:0:0:0. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier assumption. Perhaps the initial understanding was wrong. Let me read the question again. The problem states that the birds are involved in an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Adihybrid crosses involve crossing individuals with heterozygotes, typically for a single trait. Here, however, we're dealing with two traits controlled by two separate genes. So the adihybrid cross here is probably not the standard one used for single traits but involves the interaction of two different genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a cross between two birds with different genotypes, and the F2 generation refers to their offspring. In that case, the F2 generation would follow Mendelian inheritance, with each gene segregating independently. So, given the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for pigment and black body) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for pigment and brown body), the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. \n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc (pigment) \u00d7 Bb (body)\nWhich results in the following offspring:\n\n- 25% CC (pigment dominant, body dominant)\n- 25% Cc (pigment dominant, body recessive)\n- 25% cc (pigment recessive, body dominant)\n- 25% cc (pigment recessive, body recessive)\n\nWait, but no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but grouped by phenotypes. Let's apply the Punnett square properly.\n\nF1 is Cc Bb. The F2 will have the following genotypes for each gene:\n\n- C locus: Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- B locus: Bb (25%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes depend on both genes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Cc x Bb \u2192 16 possible offspring.\n\nEach gene is segregating independently, so the phenotypes can be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- Pigment (C): Presence of C (dominant) leads to red; otherwise, plain.\n- Body (B): Presence of B (dominant) leads to brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene's expression.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a particular combination of traits is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor Phenotype 1 (both C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4 (similarly)\n- Combined probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly:\n\nPhenotype 2 (C present, B absent):\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (C absent, B present):\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (neither C nor B present):\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. For C, the possibilities are:\n- C present: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C)\n- C absent: 1/4 (cc)\nSimilarly for B:\n- B present: 3/4 (BB, Bb, Bb \u2192 75% B)\n- B absent: 1/4 (bb)\nHowever, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\nThe probability of only C present (B absent): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nOnly B present (C absent): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nNeither present: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n- Both present (A): 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/16\n- Only B (C): 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be approximately 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none of them directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions G to H:\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check. Another approach is to list all possible genotypic combinations and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nEach bird in F2 can have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (red pigment, plain body)\n- Cc (pigment, brown body)\n- cc (plain pigment, whatever body)\n- bb (checkered pigment, whatever body)\n\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B and b, so:\n\nFor pigment:\n- C: red\n- c: plain\n\nFor body:\n- B: brown\n- b: checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4.

So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are present \u2192 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option G.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that seems correct.

The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): (3/4 chance of C) * (3/4 chance of B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C, no B): (3/4 C) * (1/4 bb) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B, no C): (1/4 cc) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither, plain and checkered): (1/4 cc) * (1/4 bb) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 (A) : 3 (B) : 3 (C) : 1 (D)\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Which matches our calculation.\n\nSo the answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele).",
    "rollout": " The probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele). Similarly, B present is 3/4. Assuming independence, the probability of both is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Similarly, the probability of only C present (i.e., C B is present, but B is missing?) Wait no, each bird's phenotype is based on whether each gene is dominant. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B, then it has both traits. Otherwise, it doesn't. Therefore, the number of phenotypic classes is 4: AA (both dominant), AB (only A), BA (only B), BB (none, both recessive). But since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B dominant, C recessive \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each:\n\nThe frequency of Phenotype A is the probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for both C and B. This can be calculated as 1 - probability of having no dominant alleles for either.\n\nBut alternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the probabilities can be computed as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present = 3/4\nSimilarly for B locus:\n- Probability of B present = 3/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probability for both traits being present is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of only C present is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16, and similarly for only B present is also 3/16. The probability of neither present is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nSimplifying, we can write the ratio as 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options given, option G says a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which seems different. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. The presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (any C allele), the bird is red.\n- If B is dominant (any B allele), the bird is brown.\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype X (e.g., red and brown)\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype Y (e.g., red and checkered)\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype Z (e.g., plain and brown)\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype W (e.g., plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype X: Probability that C is present AND B is present. Since C is present in 3/4 of cases and B in 3/4, and independent, it's (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n- Phenotype Y: Probability C present AND B absent. That's (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n- Phenotype Z: Probability C absent AND B present. That's (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n- Phenotype W: Probability C absent AND B absent. That's (1/4)^2 = 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, none directly match this. Wait, let me look again. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied the problem. Maybe the question considers that each bird's coat color is determined by both genes, leading to four possible phenotypes, and the F2 generation includes a certain proportion of each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the F2 generation's genotype distribution before assigning phenotypes. Let's reevaluate using a Punnett square approach for F2.\n\nF1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Cc for the C locus\n- Bb x Bb for the B locus\n\nEach locus is independently assorting, so the F2 genotype ratios are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. However, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for each bird:\n\n- Phenotype X: Both C and B dominant \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%?\nWait, no. Because the C and B loci are independent, the probability of both traits being present is (probability of C present) * (probability of B present). Since each gene has a 75% chance of being present, the probability of both being present is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of only C present (and B absent) is 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%, and only B present is also 18.75%. Finally, both absent is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios based on the combination are:\n\nPhenotype X (both dominant) : Phenotype Y (C dominant, B absent) : Phenotype Z (B dominant, C absent) : Phenotype W (neither dominant) = 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify, divide each percentage by 6.25% to get whole numbers:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, matching what I calculated earlier. However, looking at the answer choices, none of them list 9:3:3:1. The closest is option G: 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option J: 2:6:3:9, which is the inverse. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options seem to match exactly. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern\" refers to the recessive phenotype, while \"red color\" is dominant. So perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on dominance, not the exact counts. In that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (both recessive) \u2192 Phenotype W: 1 part\n2. Plain (neither dominant) \u2192 Phenotype X: 9 parts\n3. Checkered (only one dominant) \u2192 Phenotype Y: 3 parts\n4. Red (one dominant, one recessive) \u2192 Phenotype Z: 3 parts\n\nWait, no, in terms of dominance, the checkered bird is recessive for both traits, while the others have at least one dominant trait. But in reality, the phenotypic expression is based on whether each gene is dominant. So perhaps the problem expects us to count the number of dominant vs recessive traits, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the presence of pigment color and body color separately, leading to four possible phenotypes, with counts based on the number of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, since none of the answer choices match this exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Another possibility is that the F2 generation's genotypes are being considered instead of phenotypes, but the question specifically asks for phenotypic ratios. \n\nLooking back at the answer options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, implying all phenotypes are equally represented. But according to our calculations, the probabilities are skewed towards the presence of both dominant alleles, making the checkered phenotype less common than the others. \n\nOption E: 7:5:3:9 \u2013 Doesn\u2019t fit our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 Also doesn't fit. Option J: 2:6:3:9 \u2013 Again, not matching. Option K: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 Not matching. Option L: 4:4:4:4 \u2013 As above. Option M: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No. Option N: 7:5:1:7 \u2013 No. Option O: 3:5:3:9 \u2013 No. Option P: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No. Option Q: 5:3:3:9 \u2013 No. Option R: 1:1:3:9 \u2013 No. Option S: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No. Option T: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No. Option U: 2:6:3:9 \u2013 No. Option V: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No. Option W: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No. Option X: 3:5:3:9 \u2013 No. Option Y: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 No. Option Z: 4:4:4:4 \u2013 As above.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps the term 'adihybrid' was a typo or misunderstanding. It probably meant dihybrid cross. The rest seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the number of phenotypic classes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. In that case, there would be four phenotypes, but the ratios would be based on the number of individuals with each trait, without considering dominance. But that still wouldn't match the options.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is considering the F2 generation's genotype distribution, not the phenotypic distribution. Let's explore that. The F2 generation would have the following genotype ratios for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nWhen combined, the F2 genotype ratios are:\n\n(25% CC * 25% BB) = 6.25% CC BB\n(25% CC * 50% BB) = 12.5% CC Bb\n(25% CC * 25% bb) = 6.25% CC bb\n(25% CC * 50% Bb) = 12.5% CC Bb (Wait, no, this approach is wrong.)\n\nActually, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations of the F1 parents' gametes. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 genotypes are formed by combining these gametes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cB\n- cb + CB \u2192 cB \u00d7 Cc\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc\n\nThe resulting genotype ratios are:\n\nFor CC: 25% (from CB+CB)\nFor Cc: 50% (from CB+cb and cb+CB)\nFor cc: 25% (from cb+cb)\n\nSimilarly for B locus:\n\nFor BB: 25%\nFor Bb: 50%\nFor bb: 25%\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. However, the problem specifies to consider phenotypic ratios, so we need to group these into phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAs previously calculated, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Still, this doesn't match any of the answer options. The closest is option G: 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 parts, but our calculation is 9+3+3+1=16, but option G is 12+2+2+0=16. However, the components don't match. Option J: 2:6:3:9 sums to 20, which is larger than 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the answer choices, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. If I assume that the F2 generation's genotypes are being counted rather than phenotypes, but that contradicts the question's requirement for phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the number of birds with each phenotype, but didn't specify. Without further clarity, I think the correct approach is to stick with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. However, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me try recalculating the probabilities. The F1 is CcBb. Each gene is independently assorting, so the probability of C present is 3/4, B present is 3/4. The probability of both traits being present is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of only C present is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16, and similarly for only B present, 3/16. The probability of neither is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none of them match this exactly. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which also doesn't match. Option L is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows a higher frequency for the checkered phenotype. Option M is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option N is 7:5:1:7, which is similar. Option O is 3:5:3:9, which doesn't match. Option P is 12:2:2:0, same issue. Option Q is 5:3:3:9, which is different. Option R is 1:1:3:9, which is different. Option S is 5:3:2:6, which is different. Option T is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option U is 2:6:3:9, which is different. Option V is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option W is 6:2:6:2, which is 1:1:1:1, which is not matching. Option X is 3:5:3:9, which is different. Option Y is 5:3:3:9, which is different. Option Z is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which is not matching.\n\nIt appears that none of the options provide the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds with each phenotype, not the ratio. Let's see:\n\nIf each bird has a 9/16 chance of being checkered (W), 3/16 for red-brown (Y), 3/16 for plain-brown (Z), and 1/16 for red (X), the counts would be proportional to these percentages. But since the options are absolute ratios, perhaps the intended answer is the one that reflects the highest proportion of the most frequent phenotype. The highest proportion is checkered (W:9 parts), followed by red-brown (Y:3), then plain-brown (Z:3), then red (X:1).\n\nLooking at the answer options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds to 16, but the component ratios don't align with 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which adds to 20. Option K is 3:9:1:3, adding to 16. Option L is 4:4:4:4, which is 16 total. Option M is 5:3:2:6, which is 16. Option N is 7:5:1:7, which is 16. Option O is 3:5:3:9, which is 16. Option P is 12:2:2:0, same as G. Option Q is 5:3:3:9, same as K. Option R is 1:1:3:9, same as L. Option S is 5:3:2:6, same as M. Option T is 3:9:1:3, same as K. Option U is 2:6:3:9, same as Q. Option V is 3:9:1:3, same as T. Option W is 6:2:6:2, same as R. Option X is 3:5:3:9, same as U. Option Y is 5:3:3:9, same as T. Option Z is 4:4:4:4, same as K.\n\nFrom this, the only option that matches the 9:3:3:1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The probability of a bird having C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele). Similarly, B present is 3/4. Assuming independence, the probability of both is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Similarly, the probability of only C present (i.e., C B is present, but B is missing?) Wait no, each bird's phenotype is based on whether each gene is dominant. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B, then it has both traits. Otherwise, it doesn't. Therefore, the number of phenotypic classes is 4: AA (both dominant), AB (only A), BA (only B), BB (none, both recessive). But since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B dominant, C recessive \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each:\n\nThe frequency of Phenotype A is the probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for both C and B. This can be calculated as 1 - probability of having no dominant alleles for either.\n\nBut alternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the probabilities can be computed as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present = 3/4\nSimilarly for B locus:\n- Probability of B present = 3/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probability for both traits being present is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of only C present is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16, and similarly for only B present is also 3/16. The probability of neither present is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16\n\nSimplifying, we can write the ratio as 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options given, option G says a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which seems different. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. The presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (any C allele), the bird is red.\n- If B is dominant (any B allele), the bird is brown.\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype X (e.g., red and brown)\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype Y (e.g., red and checkered)\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype Z (e.g., plain and brown)\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype W (e.g., plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype X: Probability that C is present AND B is present. Since C is present in 3/4 of cases and B in 3/4, and independent, it's (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n- Phenotype Y: Probability C present AND B absent. That's (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n- Phenotype Z: Probability C absent AND B present. That's (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n- Phenotype W: Probability C absent AND B absent. That's (1/4)^2 = 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, none directly match this. Wait, let me look again. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied the problem. Maybe the question considers that each bird's coat color is determined by both genes, leading to four possible phenotypes, and the F2 generation includes a certain proportion of each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the F2 generation's genotype distribution before assigning phenotypes. Let's reevaluate using a Punnett square approach for F2.\n\nF1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Cc for the C locus\n- Bb x Bb for the B locus\n\nEach locus is independently assorting, so the F2 genotype ratios are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. However, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for each bird:\n\n- Phenotype X: Both C and B dominant \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%?\nWait, no. Because the C and B loci are independent, the probability of both traits being present is (probability of C present) * (probability of B present). Since each gene has a 75% chance of being present, the probability of both being present is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of only C present (and B absent) is 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%, and only B present is also 18.75%. Finally, both absent is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios based on the combination are:\n\nPhenotype X (both dominant) : Phenotype Y (C dominant, B absent) : Phenotype Z (B dominant, C absent) : Phenotype W (neither dominant) = 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify, divide each percentage by 6.25% to get whole numbers:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, matching what I calculated earlier. However, looking at the answer choices, none of them list 9:3:3:1. The closest is option G: 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option J: 2:6:3:9, which is the inverse. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options seem to match exactly. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern\" refers to the recessive phenotype, while \"red color\" is dominant. So perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on dominance, not the exact counts. In that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (both recessive) \u2192 Phenotype W: 1 part\n2. Plain (neither dominant) \u2192 Phenotype X: 9 parts\n3. Checkered (only one dominant) \u2192 Phenotype Y: 3 parts\n4. Red (one dominant, one recessive) \u2192 Phenotype Z: 3 parts\n\nWait, no, in terms of dominance, the checkered bird is recessive for both traits, while the others have at least one dominant trait. But in reality, the phenotypic expression is based on whether each gene is dominant. So perhaps the problem expects us to count the number of dominant vs recessive traits, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the presence of pigment color and body color separately, leading to four possible phenotypes, with counts based on the number of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, since none of the answer choices match this exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Another possibility is that the F2 generation's genotypes are being considered instead of phenotypes, but the question specifically asks for phenotypic ratios. \n\nLooking back at the answer options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, implying all phenotypes are equally represented. But according to our calculations, the probabilities are skewed towards the presence of both dominant alleles, making the checkered phenotype less common than the others. \n\nOption E: 7:5:3:9 \u2013 Doesn\u2019t fit our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 Also doesn't fit. Option J: 2:6:3:9 \u2013 Again, not matching. Option K: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 Not matching. Option L: 4:4:4:4 \u2013 As above. Option M: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No. Option N: 7:5:1:7 \u2013 No. Option O: 3:5:3:9 \u2013 No. Option P: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No. Option Q: 5:3:3:9 \u2013 No. Option R: 1:1:3:9 \u2013 No. Option S: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No. Option T: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No. Option U: 2:6:3:9 \u2013 No. Option V: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No. Option W: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No. Option X: 3:5:3:9 \u2013 No. Option Y: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 No. Option Z: 4:4:4:4 \u2013 As above.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps the term 'adihybrid' was a typo or misunderstanding. It probably meant dihybrid cross. The rest seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the number of phenotypic classes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. In that case, there would be four phenotypes, but the ratios would be based on the number of individuals with each trait, without considering dominance. But that still wouldn't match the options.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is considering the F2 generation's genotype distribution, not the phenotypic distribution. Let's explore that. The F2 generation would have the following genotype ratios for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nWhen combined, the F2 genotype ratios are:\n\n(25% CC * 25% BB) = 6.25% CC BB\n(25% CC * 50% BB) = 12.5% CC Bb\n(25% CC * 25% bb) = 6.25% CC bb\n(25% CC * 50% Bb) = 12.5% CC Bb (Wait, no, this approach is wrong.)\n\nActually, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations of the F1 parents' gametes. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 genotypes are formed by combining these gametes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cB\n- cb + CB \u2192 cB \u00d7 Cc\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc\n\nThe resulting genotype ratios are:\n\nFor CC: 25% (from CB+CB)\nFor Cc: 50% (from CB+cb and cb+CB)\nFor cc: 25% (from cb+cb)\n\nSimilarly for B locus:\n\nFor BB: 25%\nFor Bb: 50%\nFor bb: 25%\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. However, the problem specifies to consider phenotypic ratios, so we need to group these into phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAs previously calculated, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Still, this doesn't match any of the answer options. The closest is option G: 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 parts, but our calculation is 9+3+3+1=16, but option G is 12+2+2+0=16. However, the components don't match. Option J: 2:6:3:9 sums to 20, which is larger than 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the answer choices, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. If I assume that the F2 generation's genotypes are being counted rather than phenotypes, but that contradicts the question's requirement for phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the number of birds with each phenotype, but didn't specify. Without further clarity, I think the correct approach is to stick with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. However, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me try recalculating the probabilities. The F1 is CcBb. Each gene is independently assorting, so the probability of C present is 3/4, B present is 3/4. The probability of both traits being present is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability of only C present is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16, and similarly for only B present, 3/16. The probability of neither is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none of them match this exactly. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which also doesn't match. Option L is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but our calculation shows a higher frequency for the checkered phenotype. Option M is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option N is 7:5:1:7, which is similar. Option O is 3:5:3:9, which doesn't match. Option P is 12:2:2:0, same issue. Option Q is 5:3:3:9, which is different. Option R is 1:1:3:9, which is different. Option S is 5:3:2:6, which is different. Option T is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option U is 2:6:3:9, which is different. Option V is 3:9:1:3, which is different. Option W is 6:2:6:2, which is 1:1:1:1, which is not matching. Option X is 3:5:3:9, which is different. Option Y is 5:3:3:9, which is different. Option Z is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which is not matching.\n\nIt appears that none of the options provide the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds with each phenotype, not the ratio. Let's see:\n\nIf each bird has a 9/16 chance of being checkered (W), 3/16 for red-brown (Y), 3/16 for plain-brown (Z), and 1/16 for red (X), the counts would be proportional to these percentages. But since the options are absolute ratios, perhaps the intended answer is the one that reflects the highest proportion of the most frequent phenotype. The highest proportion is checkered (W:9 parts), followed by red-brown (Y:3), then plain-brown (Z:3), then red (X:1).\n\nLooking at the answer options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds to 16, but the component ratios don't align with 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which adds to 20. Option K is 3:9:1:3, adding to 16. Option L is 4:4:4:4, which is 16 total. Option M is 5:3:2:6, which is 16. Option N is 7:5:1:7, which is 16. Option O is 3:5:3:9, which is 16. Option P is 12:2:2:0, same as G. Option Q is 5:3:3:9, same as K. Option R is 1:1:3:9, same as L. Option S is 5:3:2:6, same as M. Option T is 3:9:1:3, same as K. Option U is 2:6:3:9, same as Q. Option V is 3:9:1:3, same as T. Option W is 6:2:6:2, same as R. Option X is 3:5:3:9, same as U. Option Y is 5:3:3:9, same as T. Option Z is 4:4:4:4, same as K.\n\nFrom this, the only option that matches the 9:3:3:1",

    "chunk_removed": "For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 are recessive). So for both genes, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for both traits, 3/16 for only one dominant trait, and 1/16 for neither. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square approach:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (C present)\n- 50% Cc (C present)\n- 25% cc (C absent)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (B present)\n- 50% Bb (B present)\n- 25% bb (B absent)\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe number of combinations leading to each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A: C present AND B present\n  - From C: 3/4 (all have C present except none)\n  - From B: 3/4 (all have B present except none)\n  - So combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype B: C present AND B absent\n  - From C: 3/4\n  - From B: 1/4 (only bb)\n  - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C: C absent AND B present\n  - From C: 1/4 (only cc)\n  - From B: 3/4\n  - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present\n  - From C: 1/4\n  - From B: 1/4\n  - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts Phenotype A, 3 parts B, 3 parts C, and 1 part D. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense because there are 16 possible combinations in the Punnett square. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, checking the numbers: Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts; Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts; Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3 parts; Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird:\n\nThe probability of having at least one dominant allele for C is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4. Similarly, for B: 1 - (1/4) = 3/4. Since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability that both are present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The probability of having C but not B is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. The probability of having B but not C is also 3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A (both present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype can be broken down as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nThe combined phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 red and brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 red and checkered\n3. Not C and B \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Not C and not B \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nTo find the probability of each:\n\n1. C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C and not B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Not C and B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Not C and not B: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options, option G says 12 : 2 : 2 : 2, which seems different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by considering the possible gametes and their probabilities. Each parent (F1) can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency. So F2 is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% BB (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. CC (C present) and BB (B present) \u2192 red and brown\n2. CC (C present) and Bb (B present) \u2192 red and brown\n3. CC (C present) and bb (B absent) \u2192 red and checkered\n4. CC (C present) and bb \u2192 same as above\n\nSimilarly,\n\n5. Cc (C present, c absent) and BB \u2192 red and brown\n6. Cc and Bb \u2192 red and brown\n7. Cc and bb \u2192 red and checkered\n8. Cc and bb \u2192 same as above\n\nAnd finally,\n\n9. cc (c present, so plain) and BB \u2192 plain and brown\n10. cc and Bb \u2192 same\n11. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B \u2192 3 (from CC) * 3 (from BB) = 9 (but wait, no\u2014each bird is a combination, so perhaps better to count based on combinations).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider the possible phenotypes and their counts:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B dominant \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Neither dominant \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to 9 parts red and brown, 3 red and checkered, 3 plain and brown, 1 plain and checkered. Looking back at the options, none directly match this, but let me look again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA.

But let me verify once more. Each bird can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The probabilities for each phenotype are indeed 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly say 9:3:3:1, but option C does.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): Probability = (Probability C is present) * (Probability B is present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype B (only C present): Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C (only B present): Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D (neither present): Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

So 9/16 have both traits.\nSimilarly, Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3 (C) * 1 (not B) = 3\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 1 (not C) * 3 (B) = 3\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 1 (not C) * 1 (not B) = 1\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into ratios, the F2 generation would have 9:3:3:1 ratio among the phenotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, no, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which seems incorrect.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of possible genotypic combinations for each bird is 4 (for C) times 4 (for B) = 16. Out of these, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B are present \u2192 9 out of 16 (since 3 C options and 3 B options, excluding none)\nWait, no\u2014actually, the number of genotypic combinations where both C and B are present is 3 (C) * 3 (B) = 9. So 9/16 have both traits.\nSimilarly, Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3 (C) * 1 (not B) = 3\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 1 (not C) * 3 (B) = 3\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 1 (not C) * 1 (not B) = 1\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into ratios, the F2 generation would have 9:3:3:1 ratio among the phenotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, no, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which seems incorrect. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" also incorrect. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which matches our calculation except scaled up. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, the closest match is E, which scales this up by a factor of 3: 9:3:3:1 becomes 27:9:9:3, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, in the F2 generation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't directly reflect this. Looking back, the options provided include:\n\nOption J: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 This is a ratio of 2:6:3:1, which simplifies to 2:6:3:1, but our calculation was 9:3:3:1.

Let me double-check the phenotypes based on the given information. The checkered bird is represented as 'c,' and the red bird as 'C.' Brown is 'B,' and plain is 'b.' So:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype 3 (plain red and brown)\n- Checkered (c) and plain (b): Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\n- Red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype 2 (red and brown)\n- Red (C) and plain (b): Phenotype 1 (red and checkered)\n\nWait, no, according to the problem statement, the checkered bird is 'c' and red is 'C'; brown is 'B' and plain is 'b'. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which is 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0, which doesn't fit. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" which is 1:1:1:1, not matching.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

    "rollout": " For each bird, the chance of having C is 3/4 (since 1/4 have cc), and the chance of having B is also 3/4 (since 1/4 have bb).

Now, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B): 9/16\nPhenotype B (only C): 3/16\nPhenotype C (only B): 3/16\nPhenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nNow, according to the user's options, the answer choices don't include fractions, so they've probably converted these probabilities into ratios based on counts.\n\nTotal number of birds in F2: 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, so 4 x 4 = 16)\n\nSo,\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D.

Plain red is Phenotype D, 1, and Plain brown is Phenotype A, 9. So the order in the options might correspond to the traits in the order of B, A, C, D.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The number of phenotypic classes is 4, each with different probabilities. For each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 3/16 (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 3/16 (C recessive, B dominant)\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/16 (both recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each bird, the number of possible phenotypes is four, each representing different combinations of C and B traits.",
    "rollout": " For each bird, the number of possible phenotypes is four, each representing different combinations of C and B traits. The probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): (number of ways both C and B are present) / total possibilities.\nEach bird can have four possible combinations: CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb.\n\nSo for each bird, the probability of each combination is:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4\n- CC Bb: 1/4\n- cc BB: 1/4\n- cc Bb: 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- cc BB: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1/4\n- Phenotype B: 1/4\n- Phenotype C: 1/4\n- Phenotype D: 1/4\n\nWait, but that seems off because it assumes each bird has an equal chance of expressing any phenotype, which may not be the case due to dominance. Hmm, no\u2014the key point is that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So in reality, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it expresses both traits. Otherwise, it doesn't. So for example, if a bird has CC (for C) but is bb (for B), then it will have brown body but checkered color. Similarly, if it has cc (for C) but BB (for B), it will have plain body but brown color. If it has cc and bb, it will have plain body and checkered color. If it has CC and BB, it will have red and brown. So each bird has exactly one of the four phenotypes, each with equal probability (25%). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, leading to each phenotype occurring equally often. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, they range from 6:2:2:2 up to 1:1:1:1. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs. c) and body color (B vs. b). Pigment color is determined by gene C, and body color by gene B. Each trait is expressed independently if the dominant allele is present. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown). \n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have a certain distribution among the four phenotypes. As each trait is determined independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. \n\nFor instance:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 (probability C) * (probability B) = 1 * 1 = 1, which can't be right because it implies 100% occurrence, which isn't the case. This suggests that I'm misunderstanding how the traits are combined. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Therefore, the correct approach is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the possible combinations of the two genes. \n\nEach bird can have four possible genotypes for each gene, but since the traits are determined by dominant alleles, the phenotypic expression combines the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (C+ and B+) occurs when at least one C and one B are present. The probability is calculated by subtracting the probabilities of the other phenotypes from 1. \n- Phenotype B (C+, B-) occurs when C is present but B is recessive.\n- Phenotype C (C-, B+) occurs when C is recessive but B is present.\n- Phenotype D (C- and B-) occurs when both are recessive.\n\nCalculating these probabilities:\n\nTotal probability = 1\n\n- Phenotype B: Probability of C present (3/4) times B recessive (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Probability of C recessive (1/4) times B present (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Probability of both recessive (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16\n- Phenotype A: Probability of at least one dominant in each gene. Since each bird has exactly one of the four phenotypes, Phenotype A occurs when either C is dominant or B is dominant. Alternatively, Phenotype A is 1 minus the sum of Phenotypes B, C, and D. So 1 - (3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16) = 1 - 7/16 = 9/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThis translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option J mentions a ratio of 2:6:3:9, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is similar but reversed. None of the options directly reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, did I miscalculate?\n\nLet me double-check. The probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Phenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype C: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype D: Both recessive \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:9 \u2013 not matching.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 nope.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 \u2013 no.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 nope.\n\nOption D: 4:4:4:4 \u2013 no.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to my calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, but none of the options have that. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes, and the phenotypic ratio is not necessarily 1:1:1:1. Maybe there's a different way to calculate it, such as counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without relying solely on probabilities.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance for each of the four possible genotypes (assuming independent assortment). However, the phenotypic expression combines the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it's Phenotype A.\n- If it has a dominant allele in pigment color (C) but not in body color (B), it's Phenotype B.\n- If it has a dominant allele in body color (B) but not in pigment color (C), it's Phenotype C.\n- If it has neither dominant alleles in either gene, it's Phenotype D.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since there are 16 possible genotypes, each with equal likelihood (since each gene is independently assorting), we can list them:\n\n1. 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. 25% CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n3. 25% cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n4. 25% cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nSo in terms of counts out of 100:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 25%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nWhich would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this contradicts my earlier probability calculation. Where am I going wrong?\n\nAh, I realize now that when considering phenotypic expressions, some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype. Specifically, in a dihybrid cross, certain combinations may result in the same phenotypic outcome. For example, CC BB and cc bb are both Phenotype A. CC Bb and cc BB are both Phenotype B. And similarly for the others. Therefore, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation is not simply proportional to their genetic probabilities but needs to account for phenotypic equivalence.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, when both genes are independently segregating, each combination of phenotypes occurs with a certain multiplicity. However, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, some combinations may result in the same phenotype. Specifically, for a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits (which is the case here), the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, assuming complete dominance. But in this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that each trait is completely dominant over the other. So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the answer choices, none of them match this. The closest option that fits a 1:1:1:1 ratio is option J, which states a phenotypic ratio of 2:6:3:9. But that doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount the possible phenotypes and their numbers in the F2 generation. Each of the four phenotypes corresponds to a unique combination of dominant and recessive traits. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, and each gene is independently assorting, the F2 generation will have 16 birds, with each having a 25% chance of each genotype. However, some genotypes will result in the same phenotype. For example:\n\n- Genotype CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Genotype CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Genotype cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Genotype cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAdditionally, the following genotypes result in the same phenotype:\n\n- CC BB and cc bb \u2192 both Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 both Phenotype B\n- CC BB and cc Bb \u2192 both Phenotype C\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 both Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- CC BB and cc bb both have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so both Phenotype A.\n- CC Bb and cc BB both have a dominant allele in pigment color but not in body color, so both Phenotype B.\n- CC BB and cc Bb both have a dominant allele in body color but not in pigment, so both Phenotype C.\n- CC Bb and cc BB both have neither dominant alleles, so both Phenotype D.\n\nSimilarly, the other combinations:\n\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC BB and CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC BB and cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC BB and cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that in a dihybrid cross with both parents being heterozygous for both traits, the phenotypic ratio is always 9:3:3:1, assuming complete dominance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which does not match any of the given options. However, upon closer inspection of the options, option J presents a ratio of 2:6:3:9, which is the reverse of what we expect. That seems unlikely unless there's a misunderstanding in the direction of phenotypic expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, not the theoretical probabilities. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the answer choices don't include this. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. So when they mate, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb selfed. But in reality, each parent is CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be (Cc)(Bb) x (Cc)(Bb). Let me expand this:\n\nEach parent can produce four gametes: CcBB, CcBb, cBBC, cBBC. Wait, no\u2014correctly, the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is a combination of C/B from each gene. Therefore, the F2 will have each gene recombinating, but in this case, the genes are on different chromosomes, so they assort independently. Therefore, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nBut each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (C+ and B+): 25% CC BB and 25% cc bb \u2192 Total 50%\n- Phenotype B (C+ and B-): 25% CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C (C- and B+): 25% cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D (C- and B-): 25% cc Bb \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 50:25:25:25, or simplified 2:1:1:1. But this still doesn't match any of the answer choices. I'm clearly missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question refers to the F2 generation resulting from a dihybrid cross, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygous for both traits. This means that the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be a mixture of the four genotypes. However, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But again, none of the options reflect this. \n\nLooking at the answer options again:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:9 \u2192 Sum to 20, which is half of the total 40.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Sum to 16.\n\nOption D: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All phenotypes equally represented.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, not accounting for dominance. In that case, since each bird can only express one phenotype (as each trait is determined by a dominant allele), the total number of each phenotype would be:\n\nPhenotype A: 25% of F2 \u2192 50% of all birds\nPhenotype B: 25% \u2192 50%\nWait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype relative to the total number of birds. If the total is 100 birds, then:\n\nPhenotype A: 50\nPhenotype B: 25\nPhenotype C: 25\nPhenotype D: 25\nRatio: 50:25:25:25 \u2192 Simplified 2:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore dominance and assume each bird can express any phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not indicated in the options either.\n\nWait, looking back, the question specifies that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the number of possible phenotypes is four, each representing different combinations of C and B traits. The probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): (number of ways both C and B are present) / total possibilities.\nEach bird can have four possible combinations: CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb.\n\nSo for each bird, the probability of each combination is:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4\n- CC Bb: 1/4\n- cc BB: 1/4\n- cc Bb: 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- cc BB: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1/4\n- Phenotype B: 1/4\n- Phenotype C: 1/4\n- Phenotype D: 1/4\n\nWait, but that seems off because it assumes each bird has an equal chance of expressing any phenotype, which may not be the case due to dominance. Hmm, no\u2014the key point is that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So in reality, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it expresses both traits. Otherwise, it doesn't. So for example, if a bird has CC (for C) but is bb (for B), then it will have brown body but checkered color. Similarly, if it has cc (for C) but BB (for B), it will have plain body but brown color. If it has cc and bb, it will have plain body and checkered color. If it has CC and BB, it will have red and brown. So each bird has exactly one of the four phenotypes, each with equal probability (25%). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, leading to each phenotype occurring equally often. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, they range from 6:2:2:2 up to 1:1:1:1. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs. c) and body color (B vs. b). Pigment color is determined by gene C, and body color by gene B. Each trait is expressed independently if the dominant allele is present. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown). \n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have a certain distribution among the four phenotypes. As each trait is determined independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. \n\nFor instance:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 (probability C) * (probability B) = 1 * 1 = 1, which can't be right because it implies 100% occurrence, which isn't the case. This suggests that I'm misunderstanding how the traits are combined. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Therefore, the correct approach is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the possible combinations of the two genes. \n\nEach bird can have four possible genotypes for each gene, but since the traits are determined by dominant alleles, the phenotypic expression combines the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (C+ and B+) occurs when at least one C and one B are present. The probability is calculated by subtracting the probabilities of the other phenotypes from 1. \n- Phenotype B (C+, B-) occurs when C is present but B is recessive.\n- Phenotype C (C-, B+) occurs when C is recessive but B is present.\n- Phenotype D (C- and B-) occurs when both are recessive.\n\nCalculating these probabilities:\n\nTotal probability = 1\n\n- Phenotype B: Probability of C present (3/4) times B recessive (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Probability of C recessive (1/4) times B present (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Probability of both recessive (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16\n- Phenotype A: Probability of at least one dominant in each gene. Since each bird has exactly one of the four phenotypes, Phenotype A occurs when either C is dominant or B is dominant. Alternatively, Phenotype A is 1 minus the sum of Phenotypes B, C, and D. So 1 - (3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16) = 1 - 7/16 = 9/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThis translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option J mentions a ratio of 2:6:3:9, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is similar but reversed. None of the options directly reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, did I miscalculate?\n\nLet me double-check. The probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Phenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype C: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype D: Both recessive \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:9 \u2013 not matching.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 nope.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 \u2013 no.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 nope.\n\nOption D: 4:4:4:4 \u2013 no.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to my calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, but none of the options have that. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes, and the phenotypic ratio is not necessarily 1:1:1:1. Maybe there's a different way to calculate it, such as counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without relying solely on probabilities.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance for each of the four possible genotypes (assuming independent assortment). However, the phenotypic expression combines the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it's Phenotype A.\n- If it has a dominant allele in pigment color (C) but not in body color (B), it's Phenotype B.\n- If it has a dominant allele in body color (B) but not in pigment color (C), it's Phenotype C.\n- If it has neither dominant alleles in either gene, it's Phenotype D.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since there are 16 possible genotypes, each with equal likelihood (since each gene is independently assorting), we can list them:\n\n1. 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. 25% CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n3. 25% cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n4. 25% cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nSo in terms of counts out of 100:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 25%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nWhich would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this contradicts my earlier probability calculation. Where am I going wrong?\n\nAh, I realize now that when considering phenotypic expressions, some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype. Specifically, in a dihybrid cross, certain combinations may result in the same phenotypic outcome. For example, CC BB and cc bb are both Phenotype A. CC Bb and cc BB are both Phenotype B. And similarly for the others. Therefore, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation is not simply proportional to their genetic probabilities but needs to account for phenotypic equivalence.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, when both genes are independently segregating, each combination of phenotypes occurs with a certain multiplicity. However, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, some combinations may result in the same phenotype. Specifically, for a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits (which is the case here), the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, assuming complete dominance. But in this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that each trait is completely dominant over the other. So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the answer choices, none of them match this. The closest option that fits a 1:1:1:1 ratio is option J, which states a phenotypic ratio of 2:6:3:9. But that doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount the possible phenotypes and their numbers in the F2 generation. Each of the four phenotypes corresponds to a unique combination of dominant and recessive traits. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, and each gene is independently assorting, the F2 generation will have 16 birds, with each having a 25% chance of each genotype. However, some genotypes will result in the same phenotype. For example:\n\n- Genotype CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Genotype CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Genotype cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Genotype cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAdditionally, the following genotypes result in the same phenotype:\n\n- CC BB and cc bb \u2192 both Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 both Phenotype B\n- CC BB and cc Bb \u2192 both Phenotype C\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 both Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- CC BB and cc bb both have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so both Phenotype A.\n- CC Bb and cc BB both have a dominant allele in pigment color but not in body color, so both Phenotype B.\n- CC BB and cc Bb both have a dominant allele in body color but not in pigment, so both Phenotype C.\n- CC Bb and cc BB both have neither dominant alleles, so both Phenotype D.\n\nSimilarly, the other combinations:\n\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC BB and CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC BB and cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC BB and cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CC BB and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb and cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that in a dihybrid cross with both parents being heterozygous for both traits, the phenotypic ratio is always 9:3:3:1, assuming complete dominance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which does not match any of the given options. However, upon closer inspection of the options, option J presents a ratio of 2:6:3:9, which is the reverse of what we expect. That seems unlikely unless there's a misunderstanding in the direction of phenotypic expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, not the theoretical probabilities. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the answer choices don't include this. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. So when they mate, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb selfed. But in reality, each parent is CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be (Cc)(Bb) x (Cc)(Bb). Let me expand this:\n\nEach parent can produce four gametes: CcBB, CcBb, cBBC, cBBC. Wait, no\u2014correctly, the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is a combination of C/B from each gene. Therefore, the F2 will have each gene recombinating, but in this case, the genes are on different chromosomes, so they assort independently. Therefore, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nBut each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (C+ and B+): 25% CC BB and 25% cc bb \u2192 Total 50%\n- Phenotype B (C+ and B-): 25% CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C (C- and B+): 25% cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D (C- and B-): 25% cc Bb \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 50:25:25:25, or simplified 2:1:1:1. But this still doesn't match any of the answer choices. I'm clearly missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question refers to the F2 generation resulting from a dihybrid cross, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygous for both traits. This means that the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be a mixture of the four genotypes. However, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But again, none of the options reflect this. \n\nLooking at the answer options again:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:9 \u2192 Sum to 20, which is half of the total 40.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Sum to 16.\n\nOption D: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All phenotypes equally represented.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, not accounting for dominance. In that case, since each bird can only express one phenotype (as each trait is determined by a dominant allele), the total number of each phenotype would be:\n\nPhenotype A: 25% of F2 \u2192 50% of all birds\nPhenotype B: 25% \u2192 50%\nWait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype relative to the total number of birds. If the total is 100 birds, then:\n\nPhenotype A: 50\nPhenotype B: 25\nPhenotype C: 25\nPhenotype D: 25\nRatio: 50:25:25:25 \u2192 Simplified 2:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore dominance and assume each bird can express any phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not indicated in the options either.\n\nWait, looking back, the question specifies that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles",

    "chunk_removed": "For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Using a grid:",
    "rollout": " Using a grid:\n\nPhenotype | C Present | B Present\n---|---|---\nA | Yes | Yes\nB | Yes | No\nC | No | Yes\nD | No | No\n\nEach cell represents the probability of that combination. Since the genes are independent:\n\n- A: (3/4)* (3/4) = 9/16\n- B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- D: (1/4)*(1/4)= 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, the options given don't seem to match this directly. Looking back at the options provided, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Hmm, that seems different. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the probabilities. The correct approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible combinations of the genes. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n  - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): C present, B absent.\n  - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): C absent, B present.\n  - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): Neither C nor B present.\n  - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this except possibly option H, which states 5,3,2,6. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check the definitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without accounting for dominance fully. Wait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective phenotype, so the ratio should indeed follow 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds up to 16, matching the 16 possible genotypes. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genotypic. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios after considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me try a different approach. The F2 generation consists of four phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered (dd bb): Only present in the cases where both c and b are present. From our earlier calculation, this occurs 1/16 of the time.\n- Plain and brown (dd BB or dd Bb): These occur when c is present (1/4) and b is absent (3/4). So the combined probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. But wait, also, when c is present and B is present (3/16), that's Phenotype A. So, actually, checking the counts:\n\nWait, no\u2014Phenotype A includes both B and b (both B and b), whereas Phenotype C includes only b. So perhaps:\n\n- Checkered (d and d, and b and b): Only when both alleles are recessive. This happens when both parents contribute c and b. So in F2, the probability is (1/4)^2 = 1/16.\n\n- Plain and brown (d and d, but B and b): This occurs when c is present (1/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. But wait, in F2, c can come from either parent, so maybe it's higher. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the count of each phenotype is based on the number of ways each combination can happen.\n\nLet me list the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. 25% CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown (A)\n2. 25% CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered (B)\n3. 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown (C)\n4. 25% cb cb \u2192 Plain, checkered (D)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- A (both C and B present): CC BB, CB cb, cc BB \u2192 75%?\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn terms of F2:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC (present C), 50% Cc (present C), 25% cc (no C)\n- For the B locus: 25% BB (present B), 50% Bb (present B), 25% bb (no B)\n\nBut since both are present for the phenotype, the combinations are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 A\n- CB cb \u2192 B\n- cc BB \u2192 C\n- cb cb \u2192 D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene:\n\n- A: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- B: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- D: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo, adding up all probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. The closest option is H: 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance separately. Let me think again.\n\nAnother perspective: The F2 generation is a dihybrid cross, so the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as previously established. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio. The highest option is E: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the order is different. Option G: 12,2,2,2, which also sums to 16 but the numbers don't fit. Option H: 5,3,2,6, which is 16 but the distribution is different. Option J: 2,6,3,1, which is similar but still different. Option I: 7,5,1,3, summing to 16. None of these match 9:3:3:1, but option H's ratio is 5,3,2,6. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the count of each phenotype instead of the ratio. Let me check:\n\nIf the F2 has 16 birds, and according to the ratio 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16. So if the question is asking for the count of each phenotype, then option H matches. However, the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio, which should be 9:3:3:1. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is expecting the count-based ratio, which would be 9,3,3,1, but that's not listed either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the initial description: The checkered bird is recessive (cc), and plain is dominant (CC). The brown color is dominant (B), and checkered is recessive (b). So, perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to the bird being plain, while checkered color refers to the bird being red. That could change things. Let me reinterpret the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: the bird is plain (CC)\n- Plain: the bird is red (Cc or cc)\n- Brown: the bird has brown color (B)\n- Checkered color: the bird is red (C)\n\nWait, that interpretation might affect the calculations. Let me redefine the phenotypes based on this new understanding:\n\n- Checkered: plain (CC)\n- Plain: red (Cc or cc)\n- Brown: brown (B)\n- Checkered color: red (C)\n\nUnder this definition, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered (CC): presence of C in pigment and presence of C in color \u2192 Phenotype X\n- Plain (Cc or cc): presence of C in pigment but not in color \u2192 Phenotype Y\n- Brown (B): presence of B in color \u2192 Phenotype Z\n- Checkered color (R): presence of R in pigment \u2192 Phenotype W\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (red) AND B is present (brown), then Phenotype A: red and brown\n- If C is present (red) AND B is absent (checkered), Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is present (brown), Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is absent (checkered), Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThis brings us back to the original 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, under the previous assumption where checkered refers to plain, the ratio changes. Let me redo the calculations with this new understanding.\n\nGiven this, the F2 generation has 16 birds. The phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C and not B \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Not C and B \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Not C and not B \u2192 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16, the counts would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich totals 16. Now, looking at the options again, none provide this exact ratio. Option H says 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, but the distribution doesn't match. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which is too high. Option J has 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of what we have. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which also doesn't match. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which is 16 but the distribution is even, not following the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look at the answer choices provided and see which one fits best. The user provided several options, including option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Which adds up to 16. But according to my calculations, the correct counts should be 9,3,3,1. Option H doesn't match this. Another option is E: 3,9,1,3, which reverses the order, but the counts are correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the counts without considering dominance, treating each trait as binary. But that wouldn't be accurate.\n\nWait, another thought: The question mentions \"the checkered\" as the recessive allele for color and \"plain\" as the dominant allele for color. Similarly, \"red\" is dominant for pigment, and \"brown\" is dominant for color. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So:\n\n- If a bird has pigment red (C) and color brown (B), it's Phenotype A.\n- If it has pigment red (C) and color checkered (b), Phenotype B.\n- If it has pigment plain (cc) and color brown (B), Phenotype C.\n- If it has pigment plain (cc) and color checkered (b), Phenotype D.\n\nThus, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype without considering dominance. Let's recalculate:\n\nIn F2, there are 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (C and b): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (c and B): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (c and b): 1 bird\n\nThese add up to 16. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Counts are 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16. Doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Counts reversed, but correct numbers.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Counts don't add up correctly (2+6+3+1=12).\n\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Even split.\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option H's counts are close to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to 9,3,3,1, but the closest option is H, which may have counted something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of each phenotype. Let me recount:\n\nIn F2, each trait is independent, so:\n\nFor the pigment trait (C):\n- Frequency of C present: 3/4\n- Frequency of C absent: 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the color trait (B):\n- Frequency of B present: 3/4\n- Frequency of B absent: 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- A (C and B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- B (C and b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- C (c and B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- D (c and b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 16.\n\nSo the correct counts are 9,3,3,1. However, this isn't among the options. Looking at the options again, option H's counts are 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16 but don't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the opposite of what we have. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which sums to 16 but the distribution is wrong. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. If that's the case, then option H's counts are 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. But according to our calculations, it should be 9,3,3,1. So unless I've made a mistake in counting, which I don't see, the correct answer shouldn't be H. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to the counts 9,3,3,1, but since that's not an option, I must choose the closest one.\n\nLooking back, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype A (9), but option H says 5. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the question provides multiple-choice answers and I need to pick one, despite discrepancies, I think option H is the intended answer because it sums to 16 and the other options don't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question was intending to ask about the count, not the ratio, and option H's counts are correct in terms of the number of each phenotype, even though the ratio is off. But I'm not confident.\n\nWait, another angle: The user wrote that \"the checkered color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color by recessive allele c.\" So, checkered color is when the bird has C (recessive for pigment), and plain is when it has cc. Similarly, brown is B, and checkered is b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by:\n\n- Pigment: C present \u2192 red; c present \u2192 plain\n- Color: B present \u2192 brown; b present \u2192 checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- A: Pigment red (C) and color brown (B)\n- B: Pigment red (C) and color checkered (b)\n- C: Pigment plain (c) and color brown (B)\n- D: Pigment plain (c) and color checkered (b)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as before. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, which is 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the options again, option H's counts are 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. But according to the ratio, it should be 9,3,3,1. So none",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Using a grid:\n\nPhenotype | C Present | B Present\n---|---|---\nA | Yes | Yes\nB | Yes | No\nC | No | Yes\nD | No | No\n\nEach cell represents the probability of that combination. Since the genes are independent:\n\n- A: (3/4)* (3/4) = 9/16\n- B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- D: (1/4)*(1/4)= 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, the options given don't seem to match this directly. Looking back at the options provided, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Hmm, that seems different. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the probabilities. The correct approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible combinations of the genes. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n  - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): C present, B absent.\n  - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): C absent, B present.\n  - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): Neither C nor B present.\n  - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this except possibly option H, which states 5,3,2,6. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check the definitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without accounting for dominance fully. Wait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective phenotype, so the ratio should indeed follow 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds up to 16, matching the 16 possible genotypes. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genotypic. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios after considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me try a different approach. The F2 generation consists of four phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered (dd bb): Only present in the cases where both c and b are present. From our earlier calculation, this occurs 1/16 of the time.\n- Plain and brown (dd BB or dd Bb): These occur when c is present (1/4) and b is absent (3/4). So the combined probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. But wait, also, when c is present and B is present (3/16), that's Phenotype A. So, actually, checking the counts:\n\nWait, no\u2014Phenotype A includes both B and b (both B and b), whereas Phenotype C includes only b. So perhaps:\n\n- Checkered (d and d, and b and b): Only when both alleles are recessive. This happens when both parents contribute c and b. So in F2, the probability is (1/4)^2 = 1/16.\n\n- Plain and brown (d and d, but B and b): This occurs when c is present (1/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. But wait, in F2, c can come from either parent, so maybe it's higher. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the count of each phenotype is based on the number of ways each combination can happen.\n\nLet me list the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes along with their probabilities:\n\n1. 25% CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown (A)\n2. 25% CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered (B)\n3. 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown (C)\n4. 25% cb cb \u2192 Plain, checkered (D)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- A (both C and B present): CC BB, CB cb, cc BB \u2192 75%?\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn terms of F2:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC (present C), 50% Cc (present C), 25% cc (no C)\n- For the B locus: 25% BB (present B), 50% Bb (present B), 25% bb (no B)\n\nBut since both are present for the phenotype, the combinations are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 A\n- CB cb \u2192 B\n- cc BB \u2192 C\n- cb cb \u2192 D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene:\n\n- A: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- B: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- D: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo, adding up all probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. The closest option is H: 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance separately. Let me think again.\n\nAnother perspective: The F2 generation is a dihybrid cross, so the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as previously established. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio. The highest option is E: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the order is different. Option G: 12,2,2,2, which also sums to 16 but the numbers don't fit. Option H: 5,3,2,6, which is 16 but the distribution is different. Option J: 2,6,3,1, which is similar but still different. Option I: 7,5,1,3, summing to 16. None of these match 9:3:3:1, but option H's ratio is 5,3,2,6. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the count of each phenotype instead of the ratio. Let me check:\n\nIf the F2 has 16 birds, and according to the ratio 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the options, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16. So if the question is asking for the count of each phenotype, then option H matches. However, the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio, which should be 9:3:3:1. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is expecting the count-based ratio, which would be 9,3,3,1, but that's not listed either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the initial description: The checkered bird is recessive (cc), and plain is dominant (CC). The brown color is dominant (B), and checkered is recessive (b). So, perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to the bird being plain, while checkered color refers to the bird being red. That could change things. Let me reinterpret the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: the bird is plain (CC)\n- Plain: the bird is red (Cc or cc)\n- Brown: the bird has brown color (B)\n- Checkered color: the bird is red (C)\n\nWait, that interpretation might affect the calculations. Let me redefine the phenotypes based on this new understanding:\n\n- Checkered: plain (CC)\n- Plain: red (Cc or cc)\n- Brown: brown (B)\n- Checkered color: red (C)\n\nUnder this definition, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered (CC): presence of C in pigment and presence of C in color \u2192 Phenotype X\n- Plain (Cc or cc): presence of C in pigment but not in color \u2192 Phenotype Y\n- Brown (B): presence of B in color \u2192 Phenotype Z\n- Checkered color (R): presence of R in pigment \u2192 Phenotype W\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (red) AND B is present (brown), then Phenotype A: red and brown\n- If C is present (red) AND B is absent (checkered), Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is present (brown), Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- If C is absent (plain) AND B is absent (checkered), Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThis brings us back to the original 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, under the previous assumption where checkered refers to plain, the ratio changes. Let me redo the calculations with this new understanding.\n\nGiven this, the F2 generation has 16 birds. The phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C and not B \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Not C and B \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Not C and not B \u2192 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16, the counts would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich totals 16. Now, looking at the options again, none provide this exact ratio. Option H says 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, but the distribution doesn't match. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which is too high. Option J has 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of what we have. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which also doesn't match. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which is 16 but the distribution is even, not following the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look at the answer choices provided and see which one fits best. The user provided several options, including option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Which adds up to 16. But according to my calculations, the correct counts should be 9,3,3,1. Option H doesn't match this. Another option is E: 3,9,1,3, which reverses the order, but the counts are correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the counts without considering dominance, treating each trait as binary. But that wouldn't be accurate.\n\nWait, another thought: The question mentions \"the checkered\" as the recessive allele for color and \"plain\" as the dominant allele for color. Similarly, \"red\" is dominant for pigment, and \"brown\" is dominant for color. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So:\n\n- If a bird has pigment red (C) and color brown (B), it's Phenotype A.\n- If it has pigment red (C) and color checkered (b), Phenotype B.\n- If it has pigment plain (cc) and color brown (B), Phenotype C.\n- If it has pigment plain (cc) and color checkered (b), Phenotype D.\n\nThus, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype without considering dominance. Let's recalculate:\n\nIn F2, there are 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A (C and B): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (C and b): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (c and B): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (c and b): 1 bird\n\nThese add up to 16. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Counts are 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16. Doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Counts reversed, but correct numbers.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Counts don't add up correctly (2+6+3+1=12).\n\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Even split.\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option H's counts are close to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to 9,3,3,1, but the closest option is H, which may have counted something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of each phenotype. Let me recount:\n\nIn F2, each trait is independent, so:\n\nFor the pigment trait (C):\n- Frequency of C present: 3/4\n- Frequency of C absent: 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the color trait (B):\n- Frequency of B present: 3/4\n- Frequency of B absent: 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- A (C and B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- B (C and b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- C (c and B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- D (c and b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 16.\n\nSo the correct counts are 9,3,3,1. However, this isn't among the options. Looking at the options again, option H's counts are 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16 but don't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the opposite of what we have. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which sums to 16 but the distribution is wrong. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. If that's the case, then option H's counts are 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. But according to our calculations, it should be 9,3,3,1. So unless I've made a mistake in counting, which I don't see, the correct answer shouldn't be H. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to the counts 9,3,3,1, but since that's not an option, I must choose the closest one.\n\nLooking back, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype A (9), but option H says 5. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the question provides multiple-choice answers and I need to pick one, despite discrepancies, I think option H is the intended answer because it sums to 16 and the other options don't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question was intending to ask about the count, not the ratio, and option H's counts are correct in terms of the number of each phenotype, even though the ratio is off. But I'm not confident.\n\nWait, another angle: The user wrote that \"the checkered color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color by recessive allele c.\" So, checkered color is when the bird has C (recessive for pigment), and plain is when it has cc. Similarly, brown is B, and checkered is b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by:\n\n- Pigment: C present \u2192 red; c present \u2192 plain\n- Color: B present \u2192 brown; b present \u2192 checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- A: Pigment red (C) and color brown (B)\n- B: Pigment red (C) and color checkered (b)\n- C: Pigment plain (c) and color brown (B)\n- D: Pigment plain (c) and color checkered (b)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as before. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, which is 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the options again, option H's counts are 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. But according to the ratio, it should be 9,3,3,1. So none",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird can be categorized into four phenotypic categories based on the combination of C and B alleles:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2.

Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present.",
    "rollout": " Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C, not B): (3/4 C) * (1/4 B') = 3/16 (where B' is the recessive)\n- Phenotype C (not C, B): (1/4 C') * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): (1/4 C') * (1/4 B') = 1/16\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions are A to J, each giving different ratios. Option G says 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16, matching 9+3+3+1=16. But according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly say that. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2014 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2014 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2014 matches our calculation\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2014 reversed\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2014 reversed\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2014 all 4s\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2014 sum 16, but 12 is higher than our 9\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2014 nope\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2014 nope\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2014 nope\n\nSo option C seems to match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. However, looking back, the options don't list 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G lists 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but has a different distribution. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh, wait! The parent is CC BB, and the other is cc bb. When they mate, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, when F1 selfs, what's the F2? Each gene segregates independently. So the F2 for each gene is C:C (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B. So the possible phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Perhaps I misread the parents. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which means both alleles for C are dominant, and both for B are dominant. The second parent is cc bb, both alleles recessive. So F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares of that. As I thought earlier, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try constructing the Punnett square for the F2. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 would have four possible combinations for each gene. The possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype | C | B\n--- | --- | ---\nRed & Brown (A) | Yes | Yes\nRed & Checkered (B) | Yes | No\nPlain & Brown (C) | No | Yes\nPlain & Checkered (D) | No | No\n\nThe number of each phenotype depends on the probability of each event. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of being Red & Brown is (3/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 9/16. Similarly, Red & Checkered is (3/4 for C) * (1/4 for B) = 3/16. Plain & Brown is (1/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 3/16. Plain & Checkered is (1/4 for C) * (1/4 for B) = 1/16. Adding these up gives 16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, except option G, which is 12:2:2:0. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes. Wait, no, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb. So the possible F2 phenotypes are 12:2:2:0. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Wait, 12+2+2+0=16, which makes sense. How did I get 9:3:3:1 before? I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the probabilities correctly. For each gene, the segregation is:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- A (Red & Brown): C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- B (Red & Checkered): C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- C (Plain & Brown): C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- D (Plain & Checkered): Neither C nor B \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't have this. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2014 which matches. But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, looking back, I notice that in the options, option G is 12:2:2:0. Which would correspond to a different calculation, perhaps if the parents were different. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the rules. Let me double-check: Is a plain bird considered as having no C alleles, and a brown as having at least one B allele? Yes. So the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. But perhaps the options are presented differently. Wait, looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is incorrect because it sums to 16 and represents a different ratio. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents. Let me confirm the parents: One is homozygous dominant (CC BB), and the other is homozygous recessive (cc bb). So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the square of that. So the probabilities are correct. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is not listed. However, the closest option is G, which is 12:2:2:0, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the options have typos, but assuming that the intended answer was 9:3:3:1, which is option C, but since option C is not available, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypes are counted differently. Let me consider that each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic expression combines both. Therefore, the number of phenotypes is four, with counts 9,3,3,1. Since none of the options match this, perhaps I misread the options. Wait, looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0. Which would imply that the ratio is 12 parts of phenotype A, 2 of B, 2 of C, 0 of D. That would mean that 12 + 2 + 2 = 16, which fits. But why would D be zero? Because if a bird has neither C nor B, it would be D, but perhaps under certain conditions, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes, but in this case, they are. So I think I must conclude that none of the options perfectly match the correct ratio, but option G is the closest. However, since option G does not reflect the correct probabilities, perhaps I need to reconsider. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount: For C, the chance of being present is 3/4 (as 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). For B, similarly. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C present: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the genes. Wait, the problem states that pigment color is controlled by C, and body color by B. So perhaps the presence of C determines pigmented color, and B determines body color. Thus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 instead of F2. But the question specifically asks for F2. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite it not matching the correct probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. The F2 for each gene is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: C present and B present \u2192 (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4 * 1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 16/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive alleles for simplicity, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not correct. Another possibility is that the problem considers only one trait, but the question mentions two traits. Therefore, I think the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. However, since option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 12+2+2=16, but perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of C or B leads to different phenotypes without considering dominance, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that contradicts the standard Mendelian laws. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominant trait for each gene separately, leading to four phenotypes. Therefore, I think the intended answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. However, upon reviewing, I realize that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer was option G, but it's incorrect.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C, not B): (3/4 C) * (1/4 B') = 3/16 (where B' is the recessive)\n- Phenotype C (not C, B): (1/4 C') * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): (1/4 C') * (1/4 B') = 1/16\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions are A to J, each giving different ratios. Option G says 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16, matching 9+3+3+1=16. But according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly say that. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2014 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2014 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2014 matches our calculation\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2014 reversed\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2014 reversed\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2014 all 4s\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2014 sum 16, but 12 is higher than our 9\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2014 nope\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2014 nope\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2014 nope\n\nSo option C seems to match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. However, looking back, the options don't list 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G lists 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16 but has a different distribution. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh, wait! The parent is CC BB, and the other is cc bb. When they mate, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, when F1 selfs, what's the F2? Each gene segregates independently. So the F2 for each gene is C:C (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B. So the possible phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Perhaps I misread the parents. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which means both alleles for C are dominant, and both for B are dominant. The second parent is cc bb, both alleles recessive. So F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares of that. As I thought earlier, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try constructing the Punnett square for the F2. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 would have four possible combinations for each gene. The possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype | C | B\n--- | --- | ---\nRed & Brown (A) | Yes | Yes\nRed & Checkered (B) | Yes | No\nPlain & Brown (C) | No | Yes\nPlain & Checkered (D) | No | No\n\nThe number of each phenotype depends on the probability of each event. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of being Red & Brown is (3/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 9/16. Similarly, Red & Checkered is (3/4 for C) * (1/4 for B) = 3/16. Plain & Brown is (1/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 3/16. Plain & Checkered is (1/4 for C) * (1/4 for B) = 1/16. Adding these up gives 16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, except option G, which is 12:2:2:0. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes. Wait, no, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb. So the possible F2 phenotypes are 12:2:2:0. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Wait, 12+2+2+0=16, which makes sense. How did I get 9:3:3:1 before? I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the probabilities correctly. For each gene, the segregation is:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- A (Red & Brown): C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- B (Red & Checkered): C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- C (Plain & Brown): C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- D (Plain & Checkered): Neither C nor B \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't have this. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2014 which matches. But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, looking back, I notice that in the options, option G is 12:2:2:0. Which would correspond to a different calculation, perhaps if the parents were different. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the rules. Let me double-check: Is a plain bird considered as having no C alleles, and a brown as having at least one B allele? Yes. So the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. But perhaps the options are presented differently. Wait, looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is incorrect because it sums to 16 and represents a different ratio. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents. Let me confirm the parents: One is homozygous dominant (CC BB), and the other is homozygous recessive (cc bb). So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the square of that. So the probabilities are correct. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is not listed. However, the closest option is G, which is 12:2:2:0, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the options have typos, but assuming that the intended answer was 9:3:3:1, which is option C, but since option C is not available, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypes are counted differently. Let me consider that each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic expression combines both. Therefore, the number of phenotypes is four, with counts 9,3,3,1. Since none of the options match this, perhaps I misread the options. Wait, looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0. Which would imply that the ratio is 12 parts of phenotype A, 2 of B, 2 of C, 0 of D. That would mean that 12 + 2 + 2 = 16, which fits. But why would D be zero? Because if a bird has neither C nor B, it would be D, but perhaps under certain conditions, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes, but in this case, they are. So I think I must conclude that none of the options perfectly match the correct ratio, but option G is the closest. However, since option G does not reflect the correct probabilities, perhaps I need to reconsider. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount: For C, the chance of being present is 3/4 (as 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc). For B, similarly. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C present: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither present: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThus, 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the genes. Wait, the problem states that pigment color is controlled by C, and body color by B. So perhaps the presence of C determines pigmented color, and B determines body color. Thus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 instead of F2. But the question specifically asks for F2. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite it not matching the correct probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. The F2 for each gene is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: C present and B present \u2192 (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4 * 1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 16/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive alleles for simplicity, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not correct. Another possibility is that the problem considers only one trait, but the question mentions two traits. Therefore, I think the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. However, since option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 12+2+2=16, but perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of C or B leads to different phenotypes without considering dominance, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that contradicts the standard Mendelian laws. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominant trait for each gene separately, leading to four phenotypes. Therefore, I think the intended answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. However, upon reviewing, I realize that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer was option G, but it's incorrect.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each gene, the probability of having the dominant allele is:\n\n- For C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 75% C present)\n- For B: 3/4 similarly.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability of having both dominant alleles is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. The probability of having only C (and not B) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. The probability of having only B (and not C) is also 3/16. And the probability of having neither is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C (no B) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B (no C) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, applying this to the options given:\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option G. Let me double-check:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D \u2192 1/16 of the population \u2192 So in terms of count, it's 1 unit.\n- Plain red: Phenotype B \u2192 3 units\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C \u2192 3 units\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A \u2192 9 units\n\nSo the ratio is 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to checkered red : plain red : checkered brown : plain brown. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:3:3:9. However, the options list the counts as numbers without units. Option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns perfectly with our calculation. So the answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): (3/4 chance C) * (3/4 chance B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C dominant, B not): (3/4 C) * (1/4 B recessive) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B dominant, C not): (1/4 C recessive) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither dominant): (1/4 C) * (1/4 B) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios relative to the sum of all:\n\nTotal = 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts.\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSimplifying, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2014 Not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2014 No\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2014 Yes\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2014 No\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2014 No\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 No\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2014 No\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2014 No\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2014 No\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2014 No\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 No\nL. 1, 1, 1, 1 \u2014 No\n\nOnly option C matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

Let's list them:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B present): This corresponds to the cases where C is present and B is present. From the Punnett square, this would occur when the F1 (CcBb) selfs. Specifically, the F2 genotypes would include CC BB (phenotype A), CC Bb (phenotype A), Cc BB (phenotype A), and Cc Bb (phenotype A). So there are four such genotypes, each occurring with different probabilities.\n\nWait, no\u2014the exact count needs to be done properly.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the number of possible combinations for the two traits is 4 (as above). Each combination has a certain frequency in the F2 generation. The F2 will have 16 birds (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and there are two genes). The number of birds in each phenotype is proportional to the number of favorable combinations. Let's list them:\n\nPhenotype A (both C and B present): This corresponds to the cases where C is present and B is present. From the Punnett square, this would occur when the F1 (CcBb) selfs. Specifically, the F2 genotypes would include CC BB (phenotype A), CC Bb (phenotype A), Cc BB (phenotype A), and Cc Bb (phenotype A). So there are four such genotypes, each occurring with different probabilities.\n\nWait, no\u2014the exact count needs to be done properly. Each gene has three possibilities (presence or absence of dominant allele). So for the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC (present), Cc (present), and cc (absent). Similarly for B. The phenotypes depend on both. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of birds in each category:\n\n- Phenotype A: Occurs when C is present AND B is present.\n  - The probability that C is present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc).\n  - The probability that B is present is also 3/4.\n  - Since they're independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n  - Number of birds: (9/16)*16 = 9 birds.\n\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent.\n  - Probability C present: 3/4\n  - Probability B absent: 1/4 (since B is recessive)\n  - Combined probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n  - Number of birds: 3.\n\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present.\n  - Probability C absent: 1/4\n  - Probability B present: 3/4\n  - Combined probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n  - Number of birds: 3.\n\n- Phenotype D: Neither present.\n  - Probability C absent: 1/4\n  - Probability B absent: 1/4\n  - Combined probability: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n  - Number of birds: 1.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this to phenotypic counts, it's 9 parts for Phenotype A, 3 for Phenotype B, 3 for Phenotype C, and 1 for Phenotype D. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16, which accounts for all F2 birds. \n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation: 9:3:3:1, which is exactly what we found. So the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Let me try another approach by constructing a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc BB: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Only comes from CC BB, which is 1/4 of the F2.\n- Phenotype B: Only from CcBb, which is 1/4 of the F2 (since 25% of gametes lead to CcBb).\n- Phenotype C: Only from cc bb, which is 1/4 of the F2.\n- Phenotype D: Only from cc BB, which is 1/4 of the F2.\n\nWait, but that would mean each phenotype has a 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. This suggests I'm making a mistake in understanding the parent genotypes. Perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but maybe I should interpret them differently. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the parents to be CC_bb and cc_B_, which would change the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Looking back at the options, none seem to fit 9:3:3:1. The closest is option G (12:2), but that would require a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is simplified incorrectly.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the user meant the parents as CC BB and cc bb, but perhaps the B locus is recessive, so in terms of pigment, it's brown if B is present, and checkered if not. Wait, but that was already considered earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me think: if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown (phenotype 1); if it has C but not B, it's red and checkered (phenotype 2); if it has B but not C, plain and brown (phenotype 3); if neither, plain and checkered (phenotype 4). As before, the probabilities are 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut the options don't include this. The next best thing is to look for the option that most closely matches this ratio. Option G is 12:2, which is double what I have, suggesting maybe a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations without considering dominance separately. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the sum. Another possibility is that the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes without considering dominance, leading to a different ratio. Wait, but that's not how phenotypes work. The phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or not, regardless of the number of dominant alleles present.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options reflect this. The closest is option G (12:2), which is 6:1 when simplified, but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong regarding the genotypes. Wait, the user said the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but perhaps the F1 is CC_B_ instead of CcBb. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because CC BB and cc bb would produce CcBb, not CC_B_. Unless there's a typo in the user's question. Assuming the F1 is indeed CcBb, then proceeding as before.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio isn't listed among the options. But since the user expects us to choose from the options, perhaps I should reconsider. Maybe the F2 generation results in a different ratio due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that the alleles are codominant, so no, that shouldn't apply.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the F2 generation isn't properly modeled. Let me attempt another approach. Using the standard Punnett square method for F2 generation:\n\nEach gene is independently segregating. The F2 for each gene is:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we consider the presence of dominant alleles. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C, not B \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. B, not C \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C) * (1/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 C) * (1/4 B) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation considers all possible combinations without considering dominance, which would lead to a different ratio. But that's not how phenotypes work\u2014they're determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the count.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended a different scenario. Given the available options, the closest is option G (12:2), but that would imply a different calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parent genotypes. Let me revisit the parent genotypes: CC BB and cc bb. Wait, but CC BB and cc bb cannot coexist unless one is a dominant and the other recessive for both traits. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, that makes sense because the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the Mendelian ratios. So I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option G (12:2), but I'm not sure why that would be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes without considering dominance, which would lead to a different ratio, such as 16 possible genotypes, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not an option either.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since it's not an option, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Alternatively, the user may have intended the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a 16:... ratio, but that's speculative. Without further information, I'll have to select the closest option, but I'm not confident. However, based on the standard Mendelian ratios, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed here. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G (12:2), but I'm not certain.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the chance of having C is 3/4, and the chance of having B is also 3/4. But the actual probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering all possible combinations. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:1\n\nWait, option G is 12:2, which seems off because our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. So none of the options directly match. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, but that can't be right because CC BB is homozygous dominant for both traits, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. When crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have the following genotypes: \n\nFor the C locus: \n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus: \n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this. Option G is 12:2, which would imply a different ratio. Maybe I misinterpreted the parents. Wait, the user wrote the parents as CCBB and ccbb, but perhaps it's supposed to be CC_B_ and c_c_, indicating different phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me try another approach by constructing a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc BB: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Only comes from CC BB, which is 1/4 of the F2.\n- Phenotype B: Only from CcBb, which is 1/4 of the F2 (since 25% of gametes lead to CcBb).\n- Phenotype C: Only from cc bb, which is 1/4 of the F2.\n- Phenotype D: Only from cc BB, which is 1/4 of the F2.\n\nWait, but that would mean each phenotype has a 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. This suggests I'm making a mistake in understanding the parent genotypes. Perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but maybe I should interpret them differently. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the parents to be CC_bb and cc_B_, which would change the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Looking back at the options, none seem to fit 9:3:3:1. The closest is option G (12:2), but that would require a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is simplified incorrectly.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the user meant the parents as CC BB and cc bb, but perhaps the B locus is recessive, so in terms of pigment, it's brown if B is present, and checkered if not.

Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes without considering dominance, which would lead to a different ratio, such as 16 possible genotypes, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not an option either.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since it's not an option, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Alternatively, the user may have intended the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a 16:... ratio, but that's speculative. Without further information, I'll have to select the closest option, but I'm not confident. However, based on the standard Mendelian ratios, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed here. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G (12:2), but I'm not certain.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",

    "rollout": " Instead of thinking in terms of probabilities, maybe it's easier to list all possible genotypic combinations and then map them to phenotypes. The F2 generation has four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But wait, that's not correct because each bird has two traits, so the possible phenotypes are four, but the genotypes are nine (for each gene). But since we're looking at the F2, we can group the phenotypes based on their presence of dominant alleles. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. Let's calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category. Total F2 birds: Assuming each parent produces four gametes, the F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. Wait, actually, each parent produces four gametes, so F1 (CcBb) produces eight gametes: 2 for each gene (two Cs and two Bs?), no, each parent produces four gametes. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that F1 (CcBb) produces gametes: C/B (25%), C/b (25%), c/B (25%), c/b (25%). So F2 will have 16 possible combinations: (C/B)*(C/B), (C/B)*(C/b), ..., (c/b)*(c/b). Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C/B \u00d7 C/B \u2192 CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C/B \u00d7 C/b \u2192 CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n3. C/B \u00d7 c/B \u2192 Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n4. C/B \u00d7 c/b \u2192 Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. C/b \u00d7 C/B \u2192 Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n6. C/b \u00d7 C/b \u2192 CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n7. C/b \u00d7 c/B \u2192 Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n8.

From above, Phenotype A occurs when both C and B are present. Looking at the list, Phenotype A appears in cases 1-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-12. Wait, no\u2014let me recount.\n\nLooking back, Phenotype A (red and brown) occurs when both C and B are present. How many such cases?\n\nLooking through the list, Phenotype A occurs in cases 1, 2, 3, 4 (all where both C and B are present in the first gene and the second gene). Also, in cases 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, but only when both C and B are present? Wait, no\u2014case 1 is C/C and B/B, which is both dominant. Cases 2: C/C and B/B (same as 1), but also includes C/C and B/B. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of Phenotype A birds is the number of F2 birds where both C is present and B is present. How many such combinations are there?\n\nEach gene has three possible states (dominant or recessive), but since we're looking for both to be present, for each gene: 3 possibilities, so 3*3=9 possible combinations where both are present. However, in reality, each bird has two traits, so the number of Phenotype A birds is the number of F2 birds where both C and B are present. Each gene has three possibilities (C present or not, B present or not), but only four phenotypic categories, not nine. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the number of phenotypic categories is four. The number of birds in each category depends on the number of possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the dominant allele (presence) is 3/4. Since the two genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for both traits being present (Phenotype A). Similarly, the probability for only one trait being present (Phenotype B: red and checkered) is 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16. The probability for only the other trait being present (Phenotype C: plain and checkered) is also 6/16. Finally, the probability for neither trait being present (Phenotype D: plain and checkered) is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Wait, that adds up to 9+6+6+1=22, which is more than 16. Something's wrong here. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the total number of possible phenotypic categories is four, but the sum of their probabilities should equal 1. The correct approach is to calculate the probabilities based on the presence of dominant alleles. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which accounts for all possibilities. Therefore, the probabilities are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\nPhenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this calculation because earlier I thought the F2 would have different numbers due to the specific parents. Wait, no\u2014the parents are both homozygous for both traits, so the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the squares of that. Earlier, I tried constructing a Punnett square but didn't get the correct counts. Perhaps my initial analysis was flawed. Let me try again with the correct approach.\n\nThe F2 generation is constructed from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nGene C: C (25%), c (75%)\n\nGene B: B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nC: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nB: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe phenotypes for each gene are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC/BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC/Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC/bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Cc/BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc/Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc/bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc/BB \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc/Bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc/bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Occurs when both C and B are absent.\n\nCalculating the number of each:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present. How many combinations are there? For each gene, there are 3 possibilities, so 3*3=9 combinations. But each bird has two traits, so each combination results in one bird. So 9 birds.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the number of birds for each phenotype is based on the number of possible combinations where both traits are expressed. However, since each gene has three possibilities, the number of birds with both traits present is 3*3=9 (because for each gene, the dominant allele is present). But in reality, each bird has two traits, so the number of Phenotype A birds is 9.\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present. This happens when C is dominant and B is recessive. How many combinations? For each gene, there are 3 possibilities. So 3 (C dominant) * 1 (B recessive) = 3 birds.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype C: Only B present. 1 (C recessive) * 3 (B dominant) = 3 birds.\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present. 1 (C recessive) * 1 (B recessive) = 1 bird.\n\nSo the total is 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Instead of thinking in terms of probabilities, maybe it's easier to list all possible genotypic combinations and then map them to phenotypes. The F2 generation has four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But wait, that's not correct because each bird has two traits, so the possible phenotypes are four, but the genotypes are nine (for each gene). But since we're looking at the F2, we can group the phenotypes based on their presence of dominant alleles. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. Let's calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category. Total F2 birds: Assuming each parent produces four gametes, the F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. Wait, actually, each parent produces four gametes, so F1 (CcBb) produces eight gametes: 2 for each gene (two Cs and two Bs?), no, each parent produces four gametes. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that F1 (CcBb) produces gametes: C/B (25%), C/b (25%), c/B (25%), c/b (25%). So F2 will have 16 possible combinations: (C/B)*(C/B), (C/B)*(C/b), ..., (c/b)*(c/b). Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C/B \u00d7 C/B \u2192 CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C/B \u00d7 C/b \u2192 CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n3. C/B \u00d7 c/B \u2192 Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n4. C/B \u00d7 c/b \u2192 Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. C/b \u00d7 C/B \u2192 Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n6. C/b \u00d7 C/b \u2192 CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n7. C/b \u00d7 c/B \u2192 Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n8. C/b \u00d7 c/b \u2192 cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and checkered\n9. c/B \u00d7 C/B \u2192 cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n10. c/B \u00d7 C/b \u2192 cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n11. c/B \u00d7 c/B \u2192 cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and checkered\n12. c/B \u00d7 c/b \u2192 cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n13. c/b \u00d7 C/B \u2192 cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n14. c/b \u00d7 C/b \u2192 cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and checkered\n15. c/b \u00d7 c/B \u2192 cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n16. c/b \u00d7 c/b \u2192 cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: All cases except those where either C is missing or B is missing. From above, Phenotype A occurs when both C and B are present. Looking at the list, Phenotype A appears in cases 1-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-12. Wait, no\u2014let me recount.\n\nLooking back, Phenotype A (red and brown) occurs when both C and B are present. How many such cases?\n\nLooking through the list, Phenotype A occurs in cases 1, 2, 3, 4 (all where both C and B are present in the first gene and the second gene). Also, in cases 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, but only when both C and B are present? Wait, no\u2014case 1 is C/C and B/B, which is both dominant. Cases 2: C/C and B/B (same as 1), but also includes C/C and B/B. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of Phenotype A birds is the number of F2 birds where both C is present and B is present. How many such combinations are there?\n\nEach gene has three possible states (dominant or recessive), but since we're looking for both to be present, for each gene: 3 possibilities, so 3*3=9 possible combinations where both are present. However, in reality, each bird has two traits, so the number of Phenotype A birds is the number of F2 birds where both C and B are present. Each gene has three possibilities (C present or not, B present or not), but only four phenotypic categories, not nine. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the number of phenotypic categories is four. The number of birds in each category depends on the number of possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the dominant allele (presence) is 3/4. Since the two genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)^2 = 9/16 for both traits being present (Phenotype A). Similarly, the probability for only one trait being present (Phenotype B: red and checkered) is 2*(3/4)*(1/4) = 6/16. The probability for only the other trait being present (Phenotype C: plain and checkered) is also 6/16. Finally, the probability for neither trait being present (Phenotype D: plain and checkered) is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Wait, that adds up to 9+6+6+1=22, which is more than 16. Something's wrong here. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the total number of possible phenotypic categories is four, but the sum of their probabilities should equal 1. The correct approach is to calculate the probabilities based on the presence of dominant alleles. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which accounts for all possibilities. Therefore, the probabilities are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\nPhenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this calculation because earlier I thought the F2 would have different numbers due to the specific parents. Wait, no\u2014the parents are both homozygous for both traits, so the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the squares of that. Earlier, I tried constructing a Punnett square but didn't get the correct counts. Perhaps my initial analysis was flawed. Let me try again with the correct approach.\n\nThe F2 generation is constructed from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nGene C: C (25%), c (75%)\n\nGene B: B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nC: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nB: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe phenotypes for each gene are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC/BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC/Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC/bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Cc/BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc/Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc/bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc/BB \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc/Bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc/bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Occurs when both C and B are absent.\n\nCalculating the number of each:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present. How many combinations are there? For each gene, there are 3 possibilities, so 3*3=9 combinations. But each bird has two traits, so each combination results in one bird. So 9 birds.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the number of birds for each phenotype is based on the number of possible combinations where both traits are expressed. However, since each gene has three possibilities, the number of birds with both traits present is 3*3=9 (because for each gene, the dominant allele is present). But in reality, each bird has two traits, so the number of Phenotype A birds is 9.\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present. This happens when C is dominant and B is recessive. How many combinations? For each gene, there are 3 possibilities. So 3 (C dominant) * 1 (B recessive) = 3 birds.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype C: Only B present. 1 (C recessive) * 3 (B dominant) = 3 birds.\n\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B present. 1 (C recessive) * 1 (B recessive) = 1 bird.\n\nSo the total is 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The probability of a bird having C is 3/4, and B is 3/4. Since they are independent, the probability of having both traits is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Only C without B: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B without C: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither: (1/4)^2=1/16. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Adding up to 16 parts. But looking back at the options given, none match exactly.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each bird can be categorized as:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, translating this into the phenotypic classes:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n- Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nSo now, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nPhenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich adds up to 16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2014 Doesn't match.\nB.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The actual number of possible phenotypic classes is four, as above. Each class corresponds to a specific combination. So the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/16\n\nNow, according to the options given, let's look at the answer choices. The user provided several options, including E and others. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. That is, Phenotype A (red and brown) : Phenotype B (red and checkered) : Phenotype C (plain and brown) : Phenotype D (plain and checkered) = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Wait, that's the reverse. So option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which seems inverted. So probably option E is wrong.\n- Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation.\n- Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't fit.\n- Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, doesn't match.\n- Option F: 4:4:4:4, which would imply equal distribution across all phenotypes, but that's not the case here.\n- Option C: 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\n- Option D: 1:7:5:1 \u2192 No.\n- Option B: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 No.\n- Option A: 6:2:2:2 \u2192 No.\n- Option E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Which is the inverse of what we calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the counts. The total number of possible genotypes is 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, and 4\u00d74=16). Among these, 9 have both dominant alleles, 3 have only one dominant, 3 have only one recessive, and 1 has none. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut looking at the options again, option C says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct, but the labels seem off. Checkered red refers to the phenotype with both traits, which is 9. Checkered brown is the phenotype with only B, which is 3. Plain red is the phenotype with only C, which is also 3.

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having only C (and B absent) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, and the same for only B (C absent, B present) is 3/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. Each gene has a 3/4 chance of being present in the phenotype (for C: presence is 3/4, for B: presence is 3/4). Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for both traits appearing. Similarly, the probability of having only C (and B absent) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, and the same for only B (C absent, B present) is 3/16. Finally, the probability of neither (both traits absent) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Now, mapping these to the phenotypic classes:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B present): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C, B absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B, C absent): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither, both absent): 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option H states the ratio as 5,3,2,1, which seems different.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each trait, the probability is:\n\n- For C (pigment): Presence (red) is 3/4, Absence (plain) is 1/4.\n- For B (color): Presence (brown) is 3/4, Absence (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n1. Both present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The probability of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc), and similarly for B.",
    "rollout": " The probability of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc), and similarly for B. But the combined probability of both being present is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.

Hmm, maybe I should approach it by considering all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the number of possible phenotypic combinations is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9.

C present and B absent\n3. C absent and B present\n4. C absent and B absent\n\nEach with a certain probability. To find the probability for each, we can look at the F2 genotypes and determine the phenotype. For example:\n\n- C present and B present: This occurs when the bird has at least one C allele and at least one B allele. Looking at the F2 genotypes:\n   - CC (C present, B present)\n   - Cc (C present, B present)\n   - Bb (C present, B present)\nSo the probability is 3/4 (for C present) * 3/4 (for B present) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- C present and B absent: This occurs when the bird has at least one C allele but no B allele.\n   - Cc (C present, B absent)\n   - cc (C present, B absent)\n   - cB (C present, B absent)\nBut wait, looking back, cc is C present (since C is dominant) and B absent (since B is recessive). So the probability is 1/4 (cc) + 1/4 (cB) + 1/4 (cc) = 3/4. Wait, no\u2014let me get this straight. For the C locus, the probability of C present is 3/4 (as before), and for the B locus, the probability of B absent is 1/4 (since bb is 25%). But these are independent, so the joint probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the presence of B being absent (i.e., B recessive) is 1/4, and the presence of C is 3/4. So the probability of C present AND B absent is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- C absent and B present: This occurs when the bird has no C alleles (cc) and at least one B allele (B present).\n   - cc (C absent, B present)\n   - cB (C absent, B present)\nThe probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\n- C absent and B absent: This occurs when the bird has neither C nor B alleles.\n   - cc (C absent, B absent)\n   - cB (C absent, B absent)\n   - cc (C absent, B absent)\nThe probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, adding up these probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16\n- C present, B absent: 3/16\n- C absent, B present: 3/16\n- Neither C nor B: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- 9/16 Phenotype A (C and B present)\n- 3/16 Phenotype B (C present, B absent)\n- 3/16 Phenotype C (C absent, B present)\n- 1/16 Phenotype D (Neither)\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: 1 part\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. The probability of having C present is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc), and similarly for B. But the combined probability of both being present is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present is (25% CC, 50% Cc) \u2192 75%, but that's the probability of having at least one C, not exactly one. Hmm, maybe I should approach it by considering all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the number of possible phenotypic combinations is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9. However, some of these may overlap. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is a unique combination of both traits. So there are nine possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. C present and B present\n2. C present and B absent\n3. C absent and B present\n4. C absent and B absent\n\nEach with a certain probability. To find the probability for each, we can look at the F2 genotypes and determine the phenotype. For example:\n\n- C present and B present: This occurs when the bird has at least one C allele and at least one B allele. Looking at the F2 genotypes:\n   - CC (C present, B present)\n   - Cc (C present, B present)\n   - Bb (C present, B present)\nSo the probability is 3/4 (for C present) * 3/4 (for B present) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- C present and B absent: This occurs when the bird has at least one C allele but no B allele.\n   - Cc (C present, B absent)\n   - cc (C present, B absent)\n   - cB (C present, B absent)\nBut wait, looking back, cc is C present (since C is dominant) and B absent (since B is recessive). So the probability is 1/4 (cc) + 1/4 (cB) + 1/4 (cc) = 3/4. Wait, no\u2014let me get this straight. For the C locus, the probability of C present is 3/4 (as before), and for the B locus, the probability of B absent is 1/4 (since bb is 25%). But these are independent, so the joint probability is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the presence of B being absent (i.e., B recessive) is 1/4, and the presence of C is 3/4. So the probability of C present AND B absent is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- C absent and B present: This occurs when the bird has no C alleles (cc) and at least one B allele (B present).\n   - cc (C absent, B present)\n   - cB (C absent, B present)\nThe probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\n- C absent and B absent: This occurs when the bird has neither C nor B alleles.\n   - cc (C absent, B absent)\n   - cB (C absent, B absent)\n   - cc (C absent, B absent)\nThe probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, adding up these probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16\n- C present, B absent: 3/16\n- C absent, B present: 3/16\n- Neither C nor B: 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- 9/16 Phenotype A (C and B present)\n- 3/16 Phenotype B (C present, B absent)\n- 3/16 Phenotype C (C absent, B present)\n- 1/16 Phenotype D (Neither)\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: 1 part\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA.
